      "i went in this airline the service was not good i almost slept the whole flight without eating and entertainment but i guess every airline does not have tv is so i just decided airlines with tv is is not always the best i learned my lesson the non tv is are the same as tv is for a good 787 is the first scoot flight i had i think they should have these planes to bring back 747 757 a340 a380 717 727 737 232 i love the idea of silent economy which is just economy plus with no children screaming  thanks for your video one question which kind of plug your seat had was that compatible with a c type thanks  i will be your guide on how to survive scoot long haul flights 1 bring a power bank fully charged 2 bring some snacks with you onboard 3 bring a gaming handheld to play some games to kill some time 4 bring your own amenities like eye masks earplugs toothbrushes and toothpaste one hour in economy flight for me 4 hours it can be very uncomfortable like flying indigo from india to singapore with some flights as 5hrs i am flying scoot to the philippines this year what have i got my self into  3 4 hours  paid dollar160 for 1 hour flight on this airline there is only low quality from low coster ah on 05 40 the famous vomid turn or in german kotzkurve  very nice   7 15 actually you can not bring food and drinks on scoot  happy travels on scoot i do not even use ife when on a flight i enjoy the sound of the take off landing and maybe eat then i just sleep so this would be no issue for me i took the airlines to singapore last week firstly experience everything on board is apparently expensive but the flight fee quite low if they are not i will choose regular airlines now there is none of scoot flight from berlin to singapore  max 5hrs and its already a torture btw how much is this flight i will check for mere curiosity here is a cookie bro no but no thank you  definitely not for me not long haul flights anyway thanks for the vid   bro i swear singapore things are expensive asf  scoot operted there a320 200 a320neo a321neo for short and some medium haul flights scoot uses their 787 8 9 for long haul  you should review now the low cost flight barcelona santiago de chile on level which is 14h for me the no seat recline is actually a bonus i do not care about it but it stops the people in front of me from reclining into my space  i remember back in the day the entertainment was only a few channels on the onboard radio and the middle area would have a movie running on the big screen for everyone to watch they could at least get this back on these low cost airlines  it is a budget airline what do you expect if you want full amenities then pay extra duh  5 hours a parcel on a cargo plane gets treated better than a scoot economy class passenger 13 hours no movie set amp pillow amp blanket i do not take it but it is good still thanks for the video max is 4 hrs techincally we are paying for the food and drinks on a normal flight so it is not free  i have flown scoot on sin syd 8 5 hours for a few times now and been thankful every time i am a huge cheapo so i almost never pay for add ons to my ticket except for 80mb of wifi i do tend to pack light so i just use my cabin luggage unlike some american airlines scoot overhead bins are never full scoot is good in allowing up to 10kg for cabin luggage although scoot claims that the 10kg allowance is for both cabin luggage and personal item i have never encountered a counter staff demanding to weigh my personal item so yeah if you have something super heavy put it in your personal item instead of your cabin luggage while at the counter lol you can always slip it into cabin luggage later i have found that reading up on what scoot offers and preparing accordingly is the best way to take advantage of the good prices for example you mention that the price of water is expensive which is true but also most people bring empty water bottles you are allowed to bring up to 1l containers which they fill up at the water coolers after getting past security checks that should resolve a lot of your hydration issues regarding food i have noticed that most people do buy food from scoot which is fine but again you can either pack your own food snacks from home or buy them at the airport entertainment can easily be solved by pre downloading shows to watch on your phone tablet and you can even download shows while waiting to board at the airport for the older folks most of them brought along a book for power bring your own battery pack please do not be that person who spends 8 hours in the flight watching videos on your phone only to realise that your battery is now low as a 160cm 5 3 person i do not have issues with legroom although i did recently buy a footrest hammock which was incredible and helped me sleep 6 hours on an 8 5 hour flight bring your own neck pillow if you like those and it is always good to have an extra jacket and or scarf to keep warm since the cabin can get quite cold in all honesty in my opinion flying scoot rewards people who are familiar with how airports airlines work and prepares in advance for any needs they might have and punishes people who fail to plan if you need to check in luggage it is around 30sgd when you purchase early if you check in luggage at the airport it costs 110sgd which is insane do not fall into that trap if you are a traveller who plans well though scoot is definitely a great option i find the seats comfortable flight crew friendly and of course great price  great videos always wonder how you shoot the hyperlapses and timelapses in airport do you need permission from airport security or authorities  according to their policy consumption of outside food and beverages are not allowed on board though  they competing with ryanair for worst seats i took this exact route in 2019 will do it again if the price is right the cons were that you need to bring at least a serving of food and water to make the price worthwhile do not forget to bring your own blanket pillow and entertainment food though edible were not good  i would rather do greyhound i do not care tape me to yhe ceiling just mske the flight cheap welp im still flying this to langkawi on their a320  i flew with scoot from singapore to chiang mai the attendant did not allow me to eat the burger i bought from singapore i a 7 11 store that was very unfriendly for me i seriously starved for almost 4 hours during that flight so when i landed in chiang mai ia i hurriedly grabbed my burger so i could regain my energy they should change that very unfavorable policy  i was on that same flight last year but from singapore to berlin before flying back to home i went to melbourne as well also with scoot been there with jetsar and finnair overall still same to me long flights are never fun until you arrive but also at the same time very fond memories so it did bring me back for sure d lt 3 brave man bro my guy was on scoot for 1 hours when i could not even survive 3 just give me enough oxygen so i can be unconscious the entire flight but still alive at my destination 2 5 hours only  it is not that bad for scoot i took a economy flight from singapore to jakarta and the service was great the food was good and you could even buy a scoot pikachu jet model with the pokemon livery  good luck with the injections water in singapore is much more expensive than beer   1 24 yeah tell that to malpensa airport  the silent cabin is amazing i would pay and arm and a leg to remove kids from planes those fuckers do not need intl air travel and anyone bringing a crying baby onto a plane should be labelled a terrorist 7 hours hk to sydney imagine  if you think the water price is expensive then maybe do not fly to singapore d nice trip and nice plane spotting video  7 hrs oh gosh did you see a doctor after the flight  will scoot flight attendants lock the dimmable window settings   5 41 goodbye berlin  scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money  i think 5 hours max disgusting e  typical german guy pretty beta male guy with jeans on a 12 hour flight and sausage fingers fck berlin litrally the worst town in germany ax much better smarter leadership i took a flight from taipei tpe to moscow in 2014 there was no entertainment but they provided food the flight was about 11 hours so i brought a book on the plane but now i will take the typical economy class if i fly more than 6 hours  that looks like hell  are the crew members called scooters  1 pm without onboard entertainment   2 14 as tr   honestly nothing more than 6 hours unless there is wifi also i feel like only asian old like this flight can you bring bottled water on flight i really do not want to pay for water  to this day the worst airline i have ever flown i did two round trips between tokyo and singapore in 2022 on scoot about eight hours long and both times i had just the most rude crew and overall a truly unpleasant experience plus they really do come down on you for the smallest things i had a candy bar i was eating from the changi airport 7 eleven that the flight attendant snatched out of my hand because no food from outside the plane is allowed similarly they do not let you wear headphones during taxi takeoff and landing which did not help my anxieties about takeoff landing at all zero stars i will gladly pay more to never deal with them again spirit had better service  thanks for reviewing so that we do not have to suffer indigo follow the same model or much worse 531 seats in b777 if i were the head of any regulatory agency i would not have approved such flights this is good for short people anyone who is above 190cm in height will suffer in this  1 hour max  2 hours i flew with norwegian on one of their narrow body aircraft cph dxb back when they used to fly it 6 hrs in that seat was really tough as both were night flights no entertainment no food or water unless you paid no pillows no blankets reclined approx 3deg maybe no comforts what so ever never again it was like trying to sleep on a local bus seat i only flew it to fit into a client is budget for the job but will not do that again they do not fly that route anymore no surprises really when emirates was slightly more expensive but you get everything  how do you survive respect come on water should be free on flights in come indigo  so i supppose euros20 more one way with free water more tasty food and free power outlets would make this not bad at all i would die in those seats though almost 2m and kinda wide at the shoulders if i got the isle seat in any economy people bump into my shoulders let alone the stewardesses with their little carts  i watched this to get an idea on scoot because i have been seeing this option via athens and singapore while looking for se asia flights from istanbul i do not mind at all i had actually boarded an india railways 3rd class overnight train spending the night on something that can be counted as a park bench though the silence option without babies is a win for me  hav question who fly route berlin bkk stop in athen 1hr just stay in the same airplane no need to get off right are there many late amp cancelation happened frequently i really not sure but price for the other airline are super crazy  glad to know they have seat power outlets but what about internet  plus how early do u get to the airport  5h bro from singapore changi international airport to xian xianyang international airport on a scoot a320neo umm you could have always used sch nefeld airport instead of tegel and could have gone by train to sch nefeld for decades now you are taking the same train to ber  having watched the video i really hope i would never have to  for most of my life i have travelled with low cost airlines low cost subsidiaries where flights were only 2 hours long but 12 hours on a low cost i would definitely not do that because a fews hours is good enough only  i always have this rule that if the flight will be more than 5 hours i will never ever fly low cost regardless of their price offer  new plane bi g plane but no ife headrests footrests good meals blanket and pi llow only i n scoot  ea airlines  i have flown scoot biz twice from europe australia the only plus is the seat and good legroom the service and food is dreadful would i fly them again yeah why not  flew once on scoot mel sin in scoot in silence seat very good piloting flight was peacful amp reliable  for the water if you ask the staff they will fill up your bottle or give you a cup of water you do not have to buy but they only give you a small amount each time  fill your water bottle from tap after security all 2 litres for free i have no hesitation in flying scoot good value excellent aircraft dreamliner good crew always on time for flights i have taken plus singapore kris flyer points  babies should be banned from airlines period the silence section sounds like a really good option for such a long haul flight curious how much more it costs i just tried on their website but did not want to go too far so did not find out  ahh scoot  the airline that dares you to change your booking as it costs less buying a new ticket than changing your flight date in all honesty its the biggest rip off airline i ever flew the seats are terrible that was my main issue i couldnt sleep on an 11hr 7hr flights and return too and had back and back and neck pain after  its too dissapointing to have no ife under those conditions i would say 4 hours max i would do max 6 8 hours i was watching this on a flight and thought the pa was on my plane lol i say 5 hours on wow air from baltimore to reykjavik next september i will be flying with singapore airline from frankfurt to indonesia via singapore and it costs only for 740 euros with baggage allowance 30 kgs i would never fly with low cost carrier if i had long flight it is not worth it at all only 100 euros and you will enjoy your flight with unlimitied wifi foods etc at last  someone who does a review of cattle class  great to see  lol try melbourne to london with scoot and 18 hour layover singapore airport lots of empty seats to grab wow unbelievable i also flew the 9v ofi last year i did ath sin bkk i had some downloaded media on my devices packed some snacks and purchased lunch beforehand in the app honestly loved the experience for 200 usd  i really like the brutally honest series keep the great work  the max is 3 hrs i did the athens singapore flight they offered movies via a ipad like device  this year in march the scoot flight economy cost as much as singapore airlines economy did last year for the same trip not really a cheap cost anymore but still cheap quality two hours with scoot was enough for me  my longest flight on a low cost carrier was with wizzair from brussels belgium to abu dhabi uae it was 6 hours and 20 minutes in their a321nx the price was great and the food tastet suprisingly fine in contrast to ryanair you can pre order meals or buy beverages and snacks at the airport the cabin was also extremely quiet so it made it rly easy to sleep it was not that bad as i expected i would enjoyed the flight even if the legroom was no comment it was not rly that bad so imma fly low cost cariers more frequent now  well i flew long haul non budget airlines and all i wanna do is sleep tbh youd only spend an hour on the entertainment what is more impt to me is a spotify playlist hahaha 5 hrs max you sound like john de lancie aka q from star trek the next generation last summer i did 15 hours in an a350 both ways in economy not fun but i survived  5 hrs 30 mins from qatar to budapest on a basic economy class 3 3 seat plane will never do that again lol i still got a meal pillow blanket and tv but the legroom is just too small i once flew using jetstar from singapore to perth but luckily i bought a seat in the first row i think i could still survive without pillow and blanket but i need decent space for my legs during long flights  no tv  being 203 cms id die in these seats i flew with scoot from singapore to athens and i was not feeling good on my return trip and asked for water my bank card was not working and i had no cash i literally had to plea with them to allow me to get water from the tap where the staff drink it took me at least 30 minutes until they let me fill up a cup of water even though i told them i was not feeling great staff later told me that every bottle water is counted for and if there is discrepancies staff will be punished that is why they only let me fill up a cup and not give me bottle water i would still travel with them however to save huge dollardollardollar but do not expect free water if you are feeling sick  i will spend anytime in a low cost airline at least there is entertainment in the airline app im on scoot last february singapore to cebu 4 hours ha try 10 stuck on the ground in philippines i do not know where sit here do not change seats in plane order i can see the plane out the window given water back on the same plane sit anywhere maybe they will be good one day we flew scoot from sydney to singapore in 2022 take off was delayed by 2 hours thank got my husband got 2 sandwiches and pringle is chips from the airport we were served mum is fried rice it was not even heated properly and portion is extremely small i asked for a coffee and water not knowing it would be served with a tablet to pay aud dollar15 00 it was the worst coffee again not warm enough and i know airplane coffee tastes bad but this was worst we knew we got the tickets for cheap and it was a budget airlines but man was it bad we should have found out more before booking after reaching singapore i told my husband if he ever booked this airlines i am leaving him  my daughter just did melbourne to athens via singapore on scoot due to a very long layover in singapore and delays the flight took 31 hours she said the worst part was waiting 12 hours overnight at changing airport scoot is not really cheap for a budget carrier if you are willing to top up a bit you may fly with a normal carrier and get food water entertainment  scoot is really good you just need to have your expectations to a bare minimum i agree with you the meals are really awful keep a big bottle of water with you and a book on hand  if you can not afford air travel at a reasonable price why travel in the first place  they could charge the water into your fare and give it to you free  a job from personal experience scoot is as awful as its sister company singapore airlines is great  since i reached a really good level in my career woth a good salary i pay lovely for business to have really good confort a good sleep and meal for fligths over 7 hours everything below i can survive in eco bit longer i earn the money i soend it  5 5 hrs flight to perth from singapore never again no way to travel  this was a living hell scoot was invented by the devil to torture human beings  pretty shocking about the water comfort aside that is a passenger safety issue a lack of water can cause thrombosis and the complications of thrombosis can be a life threatening heart attack or stroke price savings aside airlines should be required to do the minimum to make sure that their passengers will not be endangered during flights   2 03 boah fuck alter  flew with scoot from sydney to sg never again lmao i think i can still handle sg tokyo or sg hk but that 7 30 hrs red eye flight was simply the most tiring leg of flight i ever took 0 minutes to me it is 2h max on a budget airline nowadays i do not mind only hesitate on paying double to take a normal airline my comfort and good mood are not payable with a few hundred of euros  2 3 max  bro is big bird 180cm  done sydney to athens twice with scoot harden up i was flight also with scoot from berlin to singapore it was nice flight until i got terrible jetleg when i am arrived home  it was stormy in singapore 10 45  20 minutes i have never flown one lol i usually fly scoot for like 5 hr flight which is not too bad but i once fly long haul once due to not having any other option to fly to my destination the experience is terrible i booked via sg so it comes with all the kit and food but everything is just bad  i do not know who l why but i got surprised he had an austrian passport what did u expect its a budget airline part of my cousin is honeymoon was on scoot and she had nothing but negative things to say about the carrier and the experience  they are not even a budget airline once you add in luggage it is cheaper to fly a normal airline just a totally pointless exercise as far as i can see basically a scam  it is is scoot air boeing 787 this is just dehumanising  3 4 hours i would never try to save some money flying longhaul on this airline zip air of japan seems to be much more generous and will try them but scoot no thanks  you should try cebu pacific flight manila dubai on their a330 900 high density configuration no entertainment screen and seat pitch for short asian people even 8h30 min is terrible  i recently did a return trip on this exact route wifi was bad and i was completely board all the way  on the bright side i flew business class where there are actually power points to charge up electrical items  scoot is not cheap at all i compared the prices with qatar airways to manila and it is more expensive than qatar what a joke of an airline  i spent 2 hours and 44 minutes with ryanair from manchester to riga  that video was so nostalagic i literally come back to this after david is brutally honest on zipair  by far my favourite aviation channel anywhere on the internet so organised truthspoken and great quality videos huge respect  fun fact i had a nightmare where i had to fly scoot for 10 hours last night scoot could have just provided a video screen for entertainment probably the loneliest flight ever  bro should be knighted for taking this flight personally though i will not hop in an lcc for more than 4 hours since i will need food drinks maybe charging my phone which eventually comes close to full service airlines in terms of cost  those amenities are literally the same as you would experience flying long haul full fare economy on a major flag carrier like lufthansa british airways etc back in the 70 is amp 80 is no screens power outlets or adjustable headrests back then either had to deal with cigarette smoke in the cabin as well and the same crappy microwave quality meals to boot the difference of course being that the full fare you paid back then would have been many thousands of euros in todays money rather than only the 300 odd euros that scoot charges for the same thing as the man says you get what you pay for  wau no headrests and non reclinable seats i am a budget traveller but i could not do it without it on such a long flight look at the bright side 40 years ago your wifi was a skymall magazine and inflight entertainment was turbulence so its still the same like 5 6hrs at most and that is a fairly reluctant 5 6hr at that usually i try to fly delta if not that then american at least domestically long haul i avoid low cost  this is the first airline i have seen that did not give water for free i have been flying since early 90 is over 2 million miles worth  i would say the best thing about scoot is they run flights from singapore to a lot of smaller cities at least in asia which would otherwise need transferring i am more than ok to suffer a bit if flying with them saves me a day furthermore i can always pay a little bit extra for the more spacious seats and all the other services they are not that expensive given that the ticket itself is cheap  i actually took that flight awful exp rience but the price is great no scoot for me thank you  video is great not recommended this airline specially long tirp  just try ryanair in europe 5 mn is already too long and i am not even talking of customer service at the airport this is what you might call a flight with the bare minimum  my maximum flight duration with lcc is 5 hours more than that i will just pass lol honestly the other airlines are not too much better same 3 3 3 configuration only major difference is in flight entertainment and a mediocre tv dinner thank you for this helpful video  last year i flew mvd gru mvd with latam an airline formed by the amalgamation of the erstwhile excellent lan chile and tam brazil the bare bones economy without seat choice checked or even carry on for this 488 mile trip was gbp505 the seat i was allocated at check in was the back row without recline or window thankfully the passenger in front did not see the need to recline on this short hop that makes scoot seem rather good value  scoot changed my ceb sin flight without notice making it 2 hours earlier got to the airpirt and no flight i was flying ceb lhr on luftansa amazingly scoot blamed lufthansa for the flight time change luckily i was moved to singapore airlines for lccs i would fly cebu pacific instead  i like the idea of taking out all the baked in costs and presenting them to the consumer to choose what they actually want i only fly like 3 hour domestic u s flights and do not need power data or entertainment  i flew from melbourne to singapore a month ago and saw in the first row behind the silent area it was the best flying experience i ever had the other rows felt tight and i def would not recommend it  i once did a 13 5 hour flight from kl to london on low cost airline airasia and it was actually one of the most pleasant flights i have ever taken i have flown 225 times  322 euro is not a cheap price for a one way ticket  hot or i might be able to sit in economy class for maybe 2 3 hours max i cannot sleep on a regular air line seat going 13 hours in a fetal position would drive me over the edge  3hrs thank you for your review of long haul flight with scoot honestly after viewing your video i would avoid scoot for long haul or ultra long haul flights if possible  i have flown ultra long haul economy with other airlines between toronto canada and asia and their service was much better meals and charge power and in flight entertainment system and amenities pouch included in the price  thank you for the videos  thanks for the video low price is perfectly ok on shorter trips but not on long trips like this next month i am going on holiday to thailand from scandinavia then i take finnair down and emirates back economy class my holiday already starts with the flight which should be comfortable and i am willing to pay for that  all you have to do is ask them to fill up your water bottle it is free  scoot is crap and air asia is light years ahead i have flown both even scoot biz class and it still is the poor cousin to its malay neighbour  there is power only 8 9 eur psftt that is nothing man food is not that crazy expensive either  i would do this purely for the baby free section   flown scoot many times and they have always been reliable happy to tough it out and save a few hundred dollardollardollar use the money you save to stay an extra couple of nights or to do something special bring an empty water bottle or two to fill up after security bring snacks bring a power bank and download a few movies tv shows and it is basically the same as any other flight  did just 4 30 h from stuttgart to hurghada kids on plane should be banned   as a malaysian that nasi lemak for euros6 50 was a fucking crime  even though i travel always on budget i am glad that i have enough money to not need to consider taking scoot for long haul flights travelling on budget and being cheap or low on money are 2 different things anyway  that is how we economem travel  i am always looking at the cost but i am way to big to wanna spend 13 hours in that seat now i finally get when people are complaining about airline food that looks disgusting if any airline would ever serve me anything close to that i will never fly with them again and best of luck with getting a rest before arriving barely acceptable level of dis comfort for upto 2h flights saving cash is good but not at any cost  i always bring my own food water and warm items powerbank so it would be worth it if i ever want to use their routes so long as the seats are not harder than other airlines i am good actually the option of booking in a silent area is awesome i have not seen that before  just bought a one way ticket from tokyo to singapore for end year flight from scoot it will be my first bought it on discount but at around 200 sgd with 25kg checked bags i will be willing to bear abit rougher 6 hours for almost a third of the price of comparable singapore airlines flight i always brought a powerbank ipad mini and headphone anyway and yes i agree that air asia is in flight offerings are probably the only lcc is food offering you can consider its abit cheaper too to boot jetstar and scoot is basically same level for me  scoot is good lcc you should have tried jetstar in australia i can guarantee a day later you still in the departure airport  cheap longhaul travel will always fulfill a need  can do 13 hrs standing on my head anything else is a bonus as long as it is cheap enough  do not forget to grab some empty bottle fill it with water at the airport 5 eur for wifi on low cost is not bad lmao paying for electricity in a plane what in the world i want trust this airline because they might want you to pay for the lifejackets before they activate  in 1993 i did 13 hours on a qantas 747 400 from sydney to lax and it was the most uncomfortable flight of my life and i have flown in webbing troop seats on c 130s and in an f 4 and an a 7 no padding or cushion on ejection seats it was like sitting on concrete and we were soon sitting on our jackets just to get a little padding the call buttons did not work so we could not get any blankets to sit on and for two full hours mid flight which was in daytime we never saw any flight attendants even though our seats were close to a galley for the final hour of the ordeal there were nearly nonstop announcements about how qantas had negotiated a quick passage through customs and immigration we arrived at the same time as three other 747 400s one each from singapore hong kong and malaysia it took forever to get through customs and immigration as they scrutinised each passenger is passports and visas after we got home i wrote to the ceo of qantas and told him all of the above i got a really snarky reply from some underling or pr hack insisting that they had nothing to do with the customs and immigration procedures despite all of the on board bragging saying the opposite that their seats were new and the best in the industry and claiming that the number of cabin crew exceeded the legal minimum making it impossible that none were seen for two minutes let alone two hours a few months later one of the industry magazines had an article about how qantas was replacing all of their seats with new very comfortable models despite the old ones being new and the best in the industry and that the customer experience was being enhanced i have never been near another qantas aircraft since and i will never fly on one again it was not just the way they equipped the aircraft i love the 747 or the level of on board service it was the lies and refusal to admit any possibility a customer could have a valid complaint in contrast the earlier flight we took from la to auckland was on an air new zealand 747 400 and it was one of the best flights i have ever been on very comfortable great and attentive service even though it was an overnight flight and a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish if i ever go to australia again i will fly air nz to auckland and get a connecting flight to sydney then return home the same way  qantas  will definitely fly scoot if the price is right  please note we tried booking 2 meals and were told we cannot buy more than one meal for me preferred mode of transport is business class  scoot livery is horrendous i was told that we are not allowed to bring food on board can someone confirm for me if we can bring our own food we are ordering one meal on board but just want to know if we can bring our own food thanks for this wonderful video we are going to do this and to be frank i am pretty scared can someone also tell me how was the seat hard soft comfortable  anyone from australia 13 hours hold my beer  i absolutely loathe buget carriers and will never fly them again  2 3 hours max 4 most people can go 13 hours without eating no problem problem is if you are missing those meal windows you are gonna mess up your body clock if you are flying across time zones and you will feel the effects of jet lag even more well considering that scoot has the only direct flight between berlin and singapore i would risk a statement that people are using it as a necessity  i flew with azur air russian charter low cost airline from moscow to varadero for 13 hours was terrible but considering extremely cheap price it was worth it 40 years ago we routinely flew 8 hours on airplanes without entertainment except for a few movies shown on central screens people are spoiled today i keep finding it counter intuitive that budget airlines that crams the most seats on each plane uses the newest most advanced planes on the market while more expensive airlines especially those with longer flights uses second hand old planes they buys off budget airlines the reason is budget airlines need to fly more flights each month lower maintenance down times carry more weight so need more powerful engines and very importantly best fuel efficiency where fuel mileage per passenger counts to their profit margin and how competitively they can price their tickets more expensive airlines carry fewer passengers and weight less affected by fuel mileage so happy to save cost by using cheaper older planes they get second hand  just a warning scoot is notorious for delays for many of their long distance flights they do not fly every day if lets say your flight from athens to singapore is cancelled you may be rebooked on the next flight leaving several days later all fine if you have a flexible travel schedule but if you do not you can end up getting a refund but having to book last minute on another airline which will be expensive so you will end up paying more out of pocket  seats look like bus seats  behind door 2 it s the rest of the economy class where you can bring as many babies as you want  not in the middle of the flight right  i always take an empty plastic bottle to the airport and fill it up airside many people just have to choose the lowest fare and this is fine norwegian fares singapore to london gatwick were often gbp100 110 eur it is great seeing economy class reviews my wife and i just completed a twelve hour flight between nadi fiji and vancouver canada these are the type of flights for which we need truthful reviews thanks  hell nah one thing i hate when flying is to sit 13 hours with somebody is head on my lap when this happens i can not even open a laptop so i am already sold for scoot  sleep for 8 hours that leaves 5 hours to watch a movie on your laptop with earphones 1 litre water bottle and sleeping pills it sounds alright tbh especially for that price  depends the flight depends the price because the dude tortured himself for 13 hours i will subscribe we have flown scoot a few times and absolutely loved it we paid adollar96 one way business class singapore to sydney if you can wait around a bit longer to book they have specials on tuesdays i do not want to be spending bucket loads of mone on my transport to from a destination so okay with the airline it was comfortable clean and best of all quiet the cabin crew basically left you alone until you wanted something i would fly with them again and again  seems kinda rough for that long of a flight  one hour on a budget airline is crazy  water take an empty 1 liter bottle with you fill it up after the check in at the airport most airports have a place to fill up hot or cold water for free  one simple answer sleeping pills i did singapore to athens and only remembered tbe landing and take off i was window seat so no one bothered me i love flying scoot i usually bring a big empty bottle at least 1 litre and fill it up airside before boarding bring my own food sandwiches or some bread rolls or even mcdonalds from singapore airport again airside have a power bank and many movies downloaded on my tablet with my noise cancelling earphones with all of this for me it is just like a normal flight that costs twice as much so get organised and put the saved dollar to more spending money at your destination  i used it between singapore and australia it was possibly akin to being on a roman slave galley  its affordable you get what you pay for  the issues with water are further impacted flying sinapore to australia or au to singapore no water can be taken onboard due to australian law and there is no free water scoot promo plus fares used to be called biz can be cheaper than base economy if carefully planned what did you go to singapore for tbh i would not fly with that airline at all i have a huge distaste towards low cost airlines  i generally do not fly lost cost carriers because they are too uncomfortable and unpleasant last year i flew from jfk to singapore to manila on singapore airlines which was excellent but unfortunately on the return flights manila singapore was on scoot the check in at naia was the worst i have ever experienced really horrible and s l o w at some dinky little temporary counters that were a throw back to another era the flight was also late in departing and i wondered if i would make my connecting flight back to new york it appears scoot is singapore airlines low cost carrier or affiliate or whatever they are called i never asked for nor wanted to fly with them and even though i booked premium economy there was no premium economy on this flight they did serve me some non descript food and drinks which i guess they had to on my overall premium economy ticket i noticed not many other people were given anything at all it was not my best travel experience and unless you enjoy being treated like an annoyance and abused avoid them you get what you pay for and sometimes not  none economy and i don t mix well this video is really good well done for highlighting the issue with the water  i like travelling and your review are absolutely perfect and helpful in the past few times i had my eyes on this flight company but the flight which i was looking to difrences was too small while i have been compared i am going give you like and subscription i hope you do not mind if i refer to your channel on my reviews all best ok i flew them and to be honest they are not bad and the seat was more comfortable than i expected i did manage to get some sleep on the flight about the water make sure you bring enough bottles to fill them up before boarding and may be fee snacks i would suggest pay a little extra to reserve scoot silence or a bit more extra for front row seats for more comfortable flights i would not mine flying scoot again if the deal is great value  that is not really cheap in 2022 i flew from singapore to frankfurt and back with singapore airline for 660 euros the moment you thought the couple would fly further to melbourne in the background woah f dude that seemed to fit perfectly when cutting  my god i would rather fly sq in business and get there alive just did so last week perfect would never ever do scoot  scoot  sing syd  i feel like this is where most airlines are going to go and the price will remain high  fck me i thought i book for singapore airlines but turns out it was operate by scoot rip my trip to melbourne  just make sure they are doing maintenance well 15 years ago i would do it all the time now i would not do it for more than 4 hours  i would have no upper limit i have flown lccs many times and either order my meals or bring my own mind you it is not only lccs that lack free meals charter companies will merrily take you long haul with nothing unless you preorder or are happy with boring snacks  the trick is to catch the plane just before bedtime just sleep your way to asia  as a malaysian scoot is nasi lemak should be disowned it is not recommended to travel long haul with budget airlines if you want a little bit comfort or not bored to death sitting beside a not so normal size human sitting beside you travelled with airasia to auckland nz with two layovers in kl and gold coast with no entertainment eye mask ear muffles or pillow and yes inflight extras as expensive lol  damn i have just spent 5 hours flying on a single isle plane with a low cost carrier and found that to be exhausting  dude i flew to nz and back for only 400 more with entertainment and food included but cheers for doing this  can scoot mileage be linked to krisworld  what on earth is economy class  it looked like the plane was only a quarter full which makes you wonder how the airline can operate such routes economically  definitely not for me  did melbourne to london on air asia was really good  max 5 hours what is this accent maximum on a low cost for me is 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds  avoid scoot or any singapore or malaysian budget airline  for me scoot is a hit or miss and i agreed te food was not the best if i fkew long haul with low cost carrier my first choice will always be air asia on their premium flatbed vor routes between malaysia to australia the food is surprisingly decent however scoot is still better than another lc carrier cebu pacific that one is reslly brutal and only for the strong amd extremely budget minded person they fly between the philippines to australia and the middle east  not today or ever  i literally flew scoot economy class from singapore to berlin and back in dec 2021 5 months later i flew on a full service airline from singapore to london and back and i realised why people paid for full service  better not hear any complaining you choose to fly low cost for 12 hours just flew scoot as someone from the us who refuses to fly spirit but loves southwest i was hopeful that scoot would be more like southwest which while budget seems to prioritize passenger is comfort vs spirit which nickels and dimes you for everything unfortunately definitely came off more like spirit with extra for wi fi and all packages limited data amounts extra for charging no streaming entertainment no adjustable headrests and worst no complimentary beverages including water when we were not allowed to bring our own onboard due to the way the singapore gate was setup  not bad just pop a valium and sleep the whole way this just highlights how much other airlines overcharge you compared to the cost of the plane maintenance fuel staff etc removing inflight entertainment meals etc is not a huge saving yet there is a huge difference in ticket price  choice is good buy water at the airport if you want to save more i have the luxury to be able to fly comfortably in my younger days i would have been happy for the savings  i did syd sin last summer on the same plane and it was one of the worst flights ever staff was rude they did not turn off the light for a long time despite being a night flight the passengers were the worst loud rude and disturbing but i must say the price was unbeatable  this airline is the worst airline  especially long haul  i flew from phuket thailand to melbourne staff were helpful and polite much beter than a lot of national carriers price was very reasonable i would fly with them again  i honestly can spend up to only an hour or two without any of those  just fyi electricity on a plane is not free in the 787 there are separate generators that consume jet fuel to make electricity a regular plane has a generator section connected to the engines that takes more fuel to make electricity also the electronics to convert that energy into usable passenger adds weight making the plane less fuel efficient that said still a rip off omg never ever heard of an airline that charges for electricity heck even southwest does not do that oh wait they do not have it at all lol good video  nothing about the most important the seat comfort width and its reclineability   amystery snack pack  always bring an empty bottle to fill up on the toilet  it says on scoot s website consumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board is it not enforced then  honestly you could just like take a xanax and you will be fine in the end i did scoot gold coast to hanoi via singapore and it was ok i would give them a chance to get me to europe at least charging a lot for bottled water is standard on any airline where you pay for drinks none of the extra costs mentioned would bother me if i was paying half the cost of a regular service especially as we almost all have smart devices with downloaded films for me it is all about seat pitch and from what i could see that looked ok no scoot for me  super cheap but the food is almost un edible so bring your own  i flew berlin to singapore on scoot in 2018 very basic and it was delayed 24 hours the onward flight to melbourne ended up being on singapore airlines because of the delay essentially it is about expectations keep your expectations low and relax no problems  i recently did sydney manila on cebu pacific its is basic after a four and a half hour wait to check in the plane was even more late leaving my son said this plane is only built for 330 pax but modified to take 410 i think they had removed some toilets to get more seats in only 3 toilets up front were working and had a continious line up and they were filthy pee on floor etc the 8 hour flight was absolute torcher i realise it was a budget flight but this lack of basic hygene is wrong i paid extra for front row seating but as they changed the aircraft just before we flew they just put us anywhere i have neveer been able to get a refund of the difference i could go on a lot more but its useless and i will never fly cebupacific again  nope only star alliance member airlines 0 minutes  how much is it to use the bathroom and is there number 2 surcharge  the problem is the money you save is so small in many cases  i am from singapore and i love this airline this is my personal advice to everyone please just upgrade your seats to reclining sleeping seats this should be the premier package that comes with a screen and charging port for you i do this for all flights exceeding 6 hours best of all some flights have screens and charging ports for you on the economy class but i still always recommend everyone to just upgrade your seat to the reclining ones  i feel that budget airlines are the new economy pretty amazing deal for long flights if anything it should give the non budget airlines pause when they compete in terms of amenities honestly if you are not into mileage points this is a solid option great content lots of things can be planned for tone fair bring a tablet iots of water and food most airports offer free filling so bring an empty bottle and your golden  allowed to use the phone  i am pretty sure the crew will give you free water from the aircraft is potable water tank supply they certainly should  actually the flight was great just the passengers are young people and travellers so the atmosphere is different compared to a more expensive airline downloaded books and videos for entertainment just serve a proper coffee it is horrible next time i smuggle a starbucks on board but the price was magnifican not  this dude buys a scoot flight and complains about a fair 2euros for a water what a clown would never take this flight with the obnoxious berlin type people on board that price for water is horrible not even entertainment bruh if you have to fly scoot stay home and save for a proper vacation even in young people the risk of dvts is unacceptable especially if you are dehydrated  no one will want to travel in low cost budget if possible but the thing is most people do not have any choice like you do i have only done bne to se asia on low cost carriers jetblah airasia x being about 5 6 hours they were ok but to europe yikes i dunno either  no way could i fly on this airline on their anything class throughout the plane i have known people who have done it and say never again  scoot appears to be absolutely crap several much better lccs around  that works out to nerly euros700 return that is not cheap especially with the add ons it is possible to fly return to singapore with a recognised carrier for about the same price if you are flexible with your booking and not mind a stopover  i never been longer thsn 9 hours to be honest more than 6 is too much in a low cost if i really had to go places and paying anything extra for a proper flight would harm my financial stability or prohibit me from doing other stuff i want to do at my destination i would consider it but other than that that is just no form of flying i do not quite unterstand why low cost carriers are always so keen on showing the world that they are shitty eurowings is low cost too but they at least have a primitive ife on a plane setting you back 200 million dollars there is no reason to save the 50k they would have to pay for ife make people pay a few bucks to use it or even 3 sgd per film if you want but at least offer it this cabin looks like from 40 years ago there is nothing wrong with cutting costs as an airline in order to offer cheap tickets but why not make an effort to make things as comfortable as possible without spending lots of money cramp them seats in there make me pay for food and ife make me pay for the electricity if you feel the need but at least offer smth and dim the lights color these seats in a way i sent get eye cancer  i would 100percent fly with them just make sure to charge an ipad with movies before boarding and bring my own water and food for the trip  would have been good if you told us the price of a comparable flight with a better carrier as i do not fly there otherwise amazing vid  that looks  rough  great video i live on the east coast of australia brisbane and the nearest international airport is 15 mins from my house so it is fairly convenient to fly a full service international airline to asia americas middle east and beyond conversely we have access to budget airlines mainly flying from the gold coast 1 5 2hrs by car i have often costed out a trip on a full service airline from brisbane vs a budget airline from the gold coast and after the added expense on transport to the airport luggage meals etc the full service airline generally wins from a economic and comfort perspective takeaway points research all prices and add ons the budget price may not be so budget after all 5 hours else i will be bored honestly i think this video would attract many more casual viewers if it was called something more catchy like the longest low cost flight in the world then the rest of the video title great video otherwise  it cannot be worse than 13 hrs on british airways economy on one flight the flight attendant actually apologised for the cardboard breakfast they served not long before landing  worst looking cabin food ever unless im dying from hunger their flghts notoriously famous for delays too again unless its a mega sale fare or only airline to fly that desti  the scoot website states that consumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board so it may not be possible to bring your own people have reported that they had actually taken their drinks away from them before boarding and that they could not get anything to drink on board without paying even when they said they were feeling unwell i would never fly with an airline that treats their customers in such a way  the silence section needs to happen in more airlines especially the non budget ones short trips yes but on long haul flights no  i flew scoot on sin syd few years ago they blasted the air con to the max in order to get people to pay for the blankets and the unprepared ones were in t shirts and shorts having boarded from singapore they also made constant announcements that passengers were not allowed to consume food brought onto the plane themselves and i had to swallow my food like committing a major crime so yeah you get what you paid for  scoot tends to change your flight itenaries alot great review i love it when vloggers actually fly like the rest of us in economy  no thanks i would rather book on a good airline i may be poor but that is something i will not compromise my legs and back will only allow me 2 hours at most on that kind of setting  euros 330 return pah last year i got a winter economy return london to seoul on air france for gbp 300 main door seat too  5 6 hours max i do it everytime i enter or leave iceland there aint no fancy shit airlines comin to this country its exclusiverly wizz air and some other cheap ass eruopeans they lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate i curse them immidiate bankrupt 2 hours max i would say on ryanair 30 minutes  can you not just bring a refillable water bottle and get the flight attendants to refill it for you  there are many low cost airlines that fly now internationally that have charging ports tvs  flying to singapore on it in 2 days time night flight so i plan to sleep as much as i can i flight with my cousin last year to thailand with scoot from berlin this year we are repeating you and a lot of commenters here seem to quite like scoot for its no frills for the absolute lowest price approach however what always kept me from flying scoot is that it rarely turned out to be this incredible deal that some other commenters were lucky enough to get looking at a return ber sin itinerary for various dates this year scoot is always the cheapest with around 700euros but depending on the dates there are usually turkish or qatar airlines flights available for just 20euros 100euros more even if you do not care about any amenities this would be worth it just for the checked bag alone that is why to me it always seems like flying scoot would only ever be worth it if you are flying one way or if you need the absolute fastest connection between berlin athens to singapore  today i learned alot i thought water was always free and so does socket  it is the unscheduled delays and cancellations that make scoot a gamble more i watch more brutal it became  im not impressed livestock transport flight  i have been on this plane it was great not all heroes wear capes some document long haul budget flights for the bros  max 2 hours if i fly 13 hours i will be on 100percent bored  one i will never fly with  price conscious traveller here did singapore to berlin on this same scoot flight back in 2019 and i didnt pre order any food didnt have any movies on my phone i slept through the whole plane and although uncomfortable worth the money i believe it was under 400 sgd for a one way  ha ha i see you have got an eu how boring is that  i would fly scoot provided i could get an aisle seat back in the day planes had virtually no entertainment except for movies projected onto bulkhead screens amp audio channels piped through headphones people would bring books instead i think buying the meals is a good idea because it breaks up the flight amp is something to look forward to  without ife is one thing without ife amp power to charge my devices is whole other thing need to bring a few power bank to live thru that are you allowed to bring own food and drinks on board  this all looks completely fine  they do not provide drinking water fountain inside the boarding lounge in berlin  food is not up to scratch blame the berlin catering kitchen food is prepared on the land side of the airport that the airline is departing from food is better on air asia i would be surprised if it was not given that it was asian style food prepared in an asian country  someone needs to explain the economics of this to me are not the biggest expenses the plane itself and the fuel not the food and movies so how does that work on long haul then especially when there are not more premium seats to charge for and it is not like they are fitting double the amount of economy seats in there either  4hrs max to be honest i think i can not survive a long haul flight with scoot but i can survive a short haul flight since it has no tv flown scoot a few times honestly the food was okay i thought also had both the nasi lemak and mums fried rice will need to give air asia a go to see how it compares  basically scoot is the exact opposite from singapore airlines  i avoid airlines that offer low fares then remove amenities like power ports for the sake of recovering revenue also no in flight entertainment come on also noted and agree other low cost carrier air asia has surprisingly decent food options in their santan line uncle chin is chicken rice is a personal favorite  no i could not do this  wow those two meals looked absolutely brutally bad jesus hell if there is an asian girl waiting for me in singapore i would fly a damn kite there if i would have to  no i would not  if the price is the cheapest by a wide margin and it is a direct flight i have no complaints does not matter how expensive their water is it ai not an issue  i flew scootplus from sydney to singapore scootplus provides seats that are equivalent to premium economy on other airlines it also included entertainment food and beverages while scoot may not allow babies and toddlers in the scoot in silence cabin they do allow them in scootplus and so we had crying screaming misbehaving toddlers all the way to singapore overall it was an ok experience but i would not fly with them again better just to pay extra and fly economy class with a full service airline  only down side is flying boeing  when i travel i need to travel in style sq business class and above that is it not in hundred years i will fly such scooty scooby doody airline well the food is cheaper than norse atlantic i guess also i can not see that red artwork in the bbi terminal without thinking of those giant blood clots icu doctors and nurses were pulling out of people is tracheas during the height of the pandemic gross  best seats on this flight are in the crew rest area   having flown airasiax on the a330 a few years back i found it to be pretty decent about 20 rows of seats for passengers over 12 years only  bliss  it is so bad  when you look at scoot is destination map in europe and the middle east they basically serve destinations that are too small for it to be profitable to serve with singapore airlines  david i still miss your expectations met not met  to be honest a 3 hours flight is the pretty much for me in a lcc airline  i think 2 euro for water is still cheaper than in many airports its really good option for people travelling without add ons no food no luggage just good price if you add everything the price will be similar to full service carrier out of interest having viewed your vlog i checked scoot is price from berlin to manila for my upcoming trip at the end of the year i can fly more cheaply from edinburgh to manila with both qatar and emirates and without the additional cost of connecting to berlin so this is a no go for me thank goodness  i would not spend more than a few hours on a low cost airline low cost airlines are fine for short haul flights if i am going to take a flight to the other side of the world then i want my journey to be as comfortable as possible including having food and a few beers and inflight entertainment where i can pass the time on a couple of movies i have read the reviews for scoot on skytrax amp tripadvisor and the majority of them are negative it is enough to put me off from flying with scoot book singapore airlines instead they own scoot  i paid 750euros for a return trip in october of 22 with quatar so not even that much more but way more comfortable if the flight was like 200euros i would consider it  7 12 their website officially say consumption of outside food and beverage is not allowed lol i am flying to sydney soon and scoot was by far the cheapest option so yes i do not mind last autumn i took an overnight bus trip from munich to paris and two days later another overnight bus trip from paris to london and i did not mind as long as i can sleep i do not care how uncomfortable it is   when broke people fly long hauls  3 and a half hours i took my flight algiers to montreal with air algeria it was 9h flight the seat is very comfortable but there is not inflightentrinment the food is serving free so i spend with my device without inflightentrinment it was good scoot also flies the 787s to the gold coast which was their second destination bro after more than 30 years of flying i flew first time intercontinental lowbudget it was wizz air respect you mate no chance flying 12hrs in low budget ever again i rather swim or walk horrible and i just made a 6hrs 6hrs flight but thank you very much for you vid  its not that low cost bigge airflights company cost less max 1h even this is long  longest ive ever done was 5 hours and the only literally only good thing about it was the price i didnt buy the ticket so i had no choice but i will never fly low cost carriers ever again  i would not  if you have a family with small children please do not use a budget airline i learned the hard and painful way when i took a budget airline to hongkong from singapore i end up paying more for the additional purchases than if i took full service airlines for services that are already free if i am alone then yes budget airline is the way as i will be sleeping all the way through the flight  the problem with low coast airlines is reliability what is their policy on if the flights delayed and you miss your connecting flight my experience with low cost carriers is that they are risky they can just cancel the flight and not give you your money back  friend with scoots to singapore from sydney australia he said even on scoots business the meals quality are less than normal singapore airline economy i would only travel on this type of plane for max 2 hours i assume not many people are willing to take these flights so empty rows for your self  i made my 8hr flight from sing to mel super comfortable by paying a little for an exit row and then i brought my own food water and phone with predownloaded entertainment it was honestly super nice checked syd to ath for fun without food or entertainment for such a long flight one way it is almost aud dollar1 000 that is too expensive for what it is then there are the add ons does scoot offer movies using screens they provide you sure i would pay that is what i would like  the longest i could take budget airlines for is max 2 3 hours respect that you managed to survive for 13 hours i flew scoot from tokyo to sydney via singapore in cattle class and airline service and even seat were ok what was not ok was the passengers hence i will avoid it in the future  for the price i love flying with scoot and the food is not that bad scoot offers the most value for money and new planes too 747 8  at this price is unbelievable consider that a 9hs flight from buenos aires to eeuu can cost three times and the legroom be even worse  i salute you brother  i barely survived a 13 hour flight in premium economy on united i can not even imagine having to do this the most valuable information for me in this video is the passenger could and should bring their own water into the cabin for the long haul flight thank you very much david  it is better to check on different full service airlines tbh i paid 550euros for a return flight to singapore from frankfurt with saudia  320 euros one way 640 euros return  i can find flights with decent airlines for that price anytime its actually not bad as compared to airasia but of course its more expensive than airasia too the secret to surviving long flight on scoot is to pick book a timing you will sleep super well in i fell asleep when the plane took off and when i woke up the plane was landing best flight experience for a budget airline scoot business has also better seats than economy class of major airlines for similar price points the only downside is the lack of entertainment  seems to be busy  are you allowed to bring your own food on scoot i remember you can only consume what they sell  weird eurowings is also a budget airline but has power ports entertainment systems and free food for main meals stupid airline charges for power agree about the food air asia has much better food and agree that charging to use the onboard power points is a money grab as the ac power generated comes from the aircraft is own engines  took that flight years ago at beginning of march 2020 from singapore back home to berlin wonderful flight half the plain for myself for obvious reasons get prepared with films on your phone own blanked and neck pillow it was way better than my overcrowded and expensive lufthansa flight to singapore 5 month before but next time i would not count on an global pandemic to clear half the plane again  nice to have found your vlog glad you said you get what you paid for i fly scoot from aust to singapore and then other asian routes for me the longest flight is 5 1 2 hrs so this is comfortable with out meals movie power well done doing 13 hrs for me any long haul is with sing air fyi there is free water in the toilet cabin the money saved i can upgrade to a 5 star hotel for a week i take that if i was stuck in berlin and this flight fits my schedule i will take it having to pay for entertainment means going back to the old days of reading a book or interacting with fellow travelers or just sleeping a shame about the bottled water cost but save your money for better food in sg  a very interesting video for me i have personally flown economy on scoot 787s a number of times between sydney and singapore it is pretty much like any other reputable airline so i would happily fly that route again given the low price i might even fly on to europe from singapore but only after a stopover in my opinion it is inappropriate to compare the cost of a meal on a low budget carrier like scoot and what you might pay for a similar meal in an everyday situation it is very expensive to provide hot meals etc on planes and not doing so is how the low cost carrier can offer low fares the more appropriate question is what is the total package costing compared to a full service flight even with the egregious price for water etc the total price for this trip is amazingly low it is not quite as amazing as the headline price but it is still amazing i would also eat before getting on the plane and either fast preorder a light meal or bring some food with me given it is such a long flight you can take a book a tablet headphones and an external battery this will make it as good as any other economy flight if it is not good enough one needs to go business class  no i will not fly with them long haul low cost i would rather not go i would wait and save up for at least premium economy those seats look awfully uncomfortable 13 hours it will cost more on massages the thought of the return journey will spoil the holiday the meals did not look like real food the longest low cost flight easyjet i have ever done was just under 2 hours that was about 20 years ago do not do low cost flights any more  worst food they changed my flight schedule without proper notification and the ticket priced also not cheap they also charged me for extra 5 kilos of luggage that i did not even brought with me athens singapore manila and returned 2022   787 just simply the worst long haul out of 777 and 350 period no 787 should go 9 abreast and 777 350 should go 10 abreast either its just toooo much  the longest i am willing to do on a low cost airline is 4 maybe 5 tops i am not willing to do anything more than 8 hours in economy class on any airline though charging for the outlet is just too far next they be charging to use the lavatory i would just shit on my tray table and close it  i flew for 13 5hrs from sin ber after syd sin 8hrs i wasnt feeling the half of my body after all although it was a350 the seats are the same and literally they are even worse than bus seat besides of seating on a chair i do not wanna call it seat during the longhaaul flight the lady next to me sat on the floor put her head on the part that she is supposed to sit on and constantly hit me and invaded my space in her sleep in the last couple of hours the worst flight exp ever i also paid extra for seat selection in my second flight but i was given another seat in the middle i checked if it was the same on the app and on my boarding pass they were same but after the checkin my selection was updated on the app too so i didnt notice that mistake n update till got the middle seat rather than a window one meals were terrible too everything was terrible about it and it wasnt that much cheap though air fares are very scary in the postcovid era everybody should think twice before choosing a lowbudget airline for a longhaul fligth cuz you may regret  thanks for the video but for a long travel time like that i would rather pay for business class and i am not rich btw  i flew zipair from sin nrt lax last year coz i missed my ana love it when the price is right regular price is around 300usd one way i booked the flight departing in 2 hours and it only cost me 800 i am blessed ua ana wanted 4000 in economy one way later i flew zip often mostly in their biz class called zipflat the only complain i have for those long haul ulccs is the water you need to buy water even in biz class i drink a lot around 4l in the plane 2 meals give me 600ml and my water bottle gives me another 500ml i also bought a 1l water in the airport but that was still not enough but i made it i am going to fly real business class few days later from dps to sin to jfk in sg is signature super long haul route 18 5 hours non stop let me see if my body can handle it it is a challenge for both the flight and myself  brutally honest no i would not fly a lcc like that better stay at home  i flew with scoot once in nov 2018 jakarta singapore and should return to base after 15 mins take off due to cabin pressure failure for a long haul flight like this i rather pay more to feel comfortable not offering at least simple drinking water is cruel in my eyes don t need any entertainment though just a comfy seat somehow good food and water would do the trick for me  they really push the law of supply and demand lol they do not let you bring your own water unless it is bought from the airport which is just as overpriced i once regularly weekly flew scoot from changi to xi an china about 6 hours each way that was tolerable  3 hrs anything above 3 hours in economy is terrifying id rather put in the work and take a premium airline i guess singapore airlines serves the same food in the economy incl in ticket price  despite the not very favourable review thank you for giving the real picture of your experience and of course thank you for supporting singapore carriers  i would definitely fly 46 hrs by budget airline what is the problem easy electricity on the plane is not free it puts load on the electrical systems which in turn puts load on the generator which by virtual of being connected to the engines puts load on to which consumes fuel so no it is not free if it is provided free it will be charged in the ticket there will be the add issue of calculating fuel to load as it cost fuel to carry more fuel so ya it is not that simple  mine is 5 7 hours so meals are available just for purchase works for me  get a massage and a good meal when you land with some of the money you saved  i flew scoot fro sg to syd i thought they were pretty good  people who say they would be ok with this have clearly never flown long haul before  17 hours from singapore to new york on this airline will be brutal 3 hours is okay if flying regional too expensive 1 685euros berlin melbourne  honestly stay far away from low cost airline  we managed to fly on this line from berlin to singapore at 2018 on inaugural flight we paid 400euros for two return tickets in total an got cupcake pair of socks and dance from a cabin crew it was reasonable but i have to agree that the most annoying thing was the water price for a normal price i would not book the flight again thanks for a video it brings back the memories  bro ate the mask leak without the sambal the sauce on the rice scoot sucks i always take the legroom reviews with a grain of salt i am 193cm tall myself british airways short haul economy has a pitch of 30 inches even if i sit all the way to the back of the seat my legs will still hit the seat in front of me i think the scoot 787 comes with 31 inches if pitch i highly doubt that i will be able to do this for 12 hour on board that 787  scoot does exactly what it says on the box you get a seat on a well maintained plane that will deliver you from a to b no surprises there however if you have a problem the email and phone systems for dealing with that problem seem to be grossly overloaded and or under manned scoot is stated response time to an email complaint is currently up to 10 working days trying to contact scoot via phone in australia at least is an exercise in frustration  i will not anymore i can knit or read i do not do much that needs to plug in anyway so it does not matter as long as the trip takes  malaysia food is always better than singapore  wait not even water is included i would do it if i really need a cheap flight but in most situations i really would not scoot sucks even 4 hours singapore to manila and back recently connecting flights booked unwittingly by singapore air from south africa not cheap either both flights were late staff were inexperienced adolescents treated like sheep uncomfortable food was rubbish horrible experience as part of a long haul singapore has hand in this damaging their brand for sure  just a shame on the price rise to even have a holiday i was considering a holiday family of 4 and the prices have risen so much just before the pandemic 2ish years ago spent 2 weeks in dubai hotel with half board cost me gbp4700 pounds looked up yesterday and with the same airline dates and hotel is now gbp8400 seems to be the same where ever you look  i have a bad back so long haul lcc is not for me the longest lcc flight i have been on is only an hour from manila to cebu in the philippines i do fly westjet frequently on canada to us flights but they feel like a step above an lcc carrier but not quite a legacy carrier so that probably does not count  it is interesting to note that level is actually quite a pleasant way to fly  just went on a flight from sin to ool gold coast australia but now they are suspending the route so sad  can you take your own water bottles are they strict about the no outside food are they more lenient if foods for kids  the question at the start for me it depends on how much anaesthetic i would be allowed before boarding if you pay 350 one way that is not cheap definitely with lccs it always seem a lot less worth it the moment you have to add checked baggage it is not too far off full carrier which at least provides you with meals during a long haul  does anyone know what happened to the low cost tickets when i checked just recently the prices from ber to sin its around 900euros and higher than normal the airlines like etihad or qatar why should anyone use scoot any longer with no service and same price other airlines with meals and entertainment flew on scoot from singapore to cebu as a singapore air transfer it was business class and figured in total price under 3 hours from lax to singapore on singapore air then scoot to cebu singapore air is great living in washington state now eva air seattle to taiwan to cebu being 182 cm tall and and 98 kg i use business as more comfortable do not think i could make it 13 hours on basic economy it is the tight seating  really liked your attitude hateful are vloggers who complain about low cost airlines when they are just getting their money is worth self entitled cheapskates  please make a review of us bangla airlines novoair and air astra of bangladesh bangladesh aviation industry is growing recently you have already reviewed the national flag bearer biman bangladesh airlines please review the three private airlines next and give your opinion about their service and quality  anyone flown europe to aus i have flown scoot biz now scoot plus between singapore amp australia a few times hubby is an aviation enthusiast airline snob who actually loves the flying aspect but he is also a tall and big guy so he will only fly premium economy or business he did he does not think he can fly that long without flat bed and he just hated flying economy to europe with emirates even in exit rows which is ironic since he can sleep anytime literally standing up to board a plane or on a construction site and in the one who has trouble sleeping on planes  if anyone has done europe to aus what was it like i suggested we break up the flight by staying in singapore 2 or 3 nights which is what i usually like to do since i do not sleep on planes stay a couple of nights in asia or dubai so i can have real sleep and start adjusting to time difference i would love to know if scoot plus holds up against other premium economy seats thanks  i tried 7 hours on scoot from tokyo to singapore on business class thinking there will be entertainment there was 1 microwaved meal 1 bottled 300ml water and bigger seat not even wine if you want to purchase i ended up staring into blank and forcing myself to sleep starving  gt lt will do it again but with my own entertainment alot of food and a bottle of wine  i wont fly even if they pay me humans are not animals great video  nothing seems bad first of all it is a non stop flight and secondly you do not starve for 12 hours even though you received two meals at this price it is super ok try to go with tarom from bucharest to beirut and you will see that you pay almost 200 euros and get a candy and a glass of water a 2 20 hour flight  13 hours on a plane what a nightmare im tired after 2 hours   hey simply what editor do you use  dollar300ish for one way from berlin to sgp that is cheaper than local ticket on my country 3 hours flight can cost me dollar150  ngl the livery is nice ye a plastic bottle would be worth carrying to fill with water once you have cleared security might save a few euros  when you say adjustable headrests do you really mean adjustable seat backs  charging for power is just horrid  dude it is a 787 dreamliner the state of the art and aviation comfort how rough could it have been  ruben stlund who wrote triangle of sadness next film will be called the entertainment system is down and will portray a longhaul flight were the entertainment system crash and the passengers are left to their own devices the plot is that without entertainment people go mad guess scoot proved him wrong  great video i personally would never fly on a low cost airline having a comfortable flight is way more important to me then cost  regulations should make water mandatory in any flight i really can not understand how the eu allows something this low you should never refuse water to anyone  4 hours uk to canaries or greece this was the worst flight ever but i was a student and had no money so in that regard i got what i paid for  i have tried jetstar from melbourne to bangkok approximately 9 10 hrs basic eco without food or drinks the worst experience ever mostly from the other passengers i was not aware that cheap price would come with lower quality people no manner loud noise walking around like they are visiting the zoo never do low cost long haul flight again  hey simply aviation nice videos d well when my sister and me travelled to singapore in 1993 we did so without in flight entertainment too because it was not yet a thing they fed us though  i can bring entertainment by myself using ipad i can also bring snacks and drinks by myself  scoot is my goto australia to philippines airline of choice after trying qantas jetstar air asia philippine airlines and cebu pacific i do pay extra for scoot in silence pre order meals and pack a power bank into my carry on the food is not great but where else can you get the extra leg room and a guarantee of no screaming babies for a similar price i tried scoot plus and yes it is more comfortable but at 8 hours not necessary probably not even at 12 hours and it is a significan not cost over iscoot in silence where as iscoot in silence is not a great deal more expensive than economy my recommendation definitely iscoot in silence  when aax turn around this scoot will go restructuring again that is a nightmare no nothing no food no water no movies u will go crazy tape to the ceiling i do not care  i have flown scoot several times between taipei and singapore and will be doing so again in two weeks for short haul flights it is not that bad would not do so on flights longer than that but i guess for the ultra low budget travellers it is a good compromise  do they still have the rule where you can not bring your own food and drinks on the plane they use to fly hnl gt kix gt sg but they closed out after just 1 year not much hi locals liked the idea of not allowing food onboard unless you bought from them since hi is famous about plate lunches and bentos  the lack of adjustable headrests on these scoot 787 aircraft would be the main downfall for me same on air asia a330 one of the worst flights in my life was on an air asia a330 impossible to sleep surprisingly t way air from korea however surprisingly comfortable in seat power holder for ipad in seat tray adjustable headrest etc made them far more comfortable for longer journey  less than 2 hours mate on a low cost airline you got a very good price but usually it is more like euro 450 for the sector berlin to singapore singapore to berlin is even higher the final price for a return ticket is raw sgd 1330 at this moment for a return flight in june no changi prison style meals no platinum water included wait  i noticed the meals they serve at changi prison are nicer a return flight with quatar or finnair is around sgd 1500 at the moment i get proper meals videos nicer seats free water etc etc to my experience scoot is often not worth it it is only that particular leg that is a bit cheaper  2 euros for a bottle of water in a plane it is expensive in the airport or even on a rest station on the highway it is more expensive   5 hours on ryanair dublin to cyprus is about all i can handle 13 hours in economy class it is an overwhelming no from me  320 euros one way too much then again airport taxes out of germany are quite high before covid i paid innsbruck frankfurt mexico city and back 540 euros return including checked bag and food and drinks if you can not afford an extra 100 bucks for a 12 13 hour flight then you might as well stay home  4 hours 6hrs  time in a low cost carrier 0 hours  7  300 euro is for a one way to singapore in these times yes i would pay that would book the scoot silent most likely a seat closest to the plus seats can live with two pre booked meals and two bottles of water bought on the airplane as well when will the come to amsterdam and or brussel  i took this flight before fr singapore to berlin n back it was an interesting flight n value for money no complaints worth the money 4 hours unfortunately the only airline with a direct flight singapore berlin at the moment  320 eur 1 way is kind of pricey my oct 22 trip 420eur return for sia econ promo kul sin muc zrh sin kul  watching your video after a long time and suprised to find voiceover now fanstastik addition  scoot is certainly not going to win any awards for its in flight catering   that kinda felt like always being at mercy i mean i am okay with having no food movies and blankets but that feeling like being looked upon as peasants having to pay for anything you touch is unsettling and on a long haul flight having no leg space and no reclining seat i know there are people who hardly care about such things and i really envy them but its dreadful for me on the other hand its perfect for a short journey say about 4 hours  2 hours 45 minutes please do vietjet is international economy  this looked like the most depressing flight ever  i checked and the seat pitch is 31 which is no worse than most real airlines and considerably better than the 28 of spirit or frontier or the 30 of ryanair and the width is 18 which is actually better than emirates so yes i would fly with them if i saved enough to more than make up for the price of the food and drinks  i flew scoot    once  never again im flying to athens in july with scoot from melbourne via singapore this makes my more comfortable seeing the experience great video you act like it is a rare thing this is normal for most people that is how long a plane takes it does not matter if you are rich or poor  the longest flight on budget airline which i can endure will be sin to bkk nothing beyond that i have flown scoot from perth to athens as i am 6 5 tall i chose scoot plus the seat was excellent but thats it the food and service was lousy given the price i would fly with them again  and scoot flies to perth it is a budget carrier what do you guys expect really  my longest non stop flight on a budget airline for me was when i used to travel often between kuala lumpur kul which is just a stone throw away from singapore to london on airasia london to kul normally took about 13 hours 30 minutes and kul to london was a bit longer taking about 14 hours 5 minutes coincidentally i also used to live in berlin until the opening of brandenburg airport berlin really did not fly to any long haul destinations simply because of the limitations of tegel when services moved to sch nefeld which would become part of berlin brandenburg airport things got better however the fact that brandenburg airport was able to open at all was a small miracle after running into a never ending list of logistical and financial problems throughout the more than 14 years after construction began to finally open for commercial traffic  height in centimeters  what is a centimeter  power bank smartphone ready with plenty of movies series books water after security check and food before security check as it is cheaper bought at the airport is the playbook to fly low cost for more than say 3 hours  this is a brave man he does these things so we do not need to  to be fair most of us aussies do not consider a 7hr flight to singapore as a long haul flight  scoot is a good low cost airline to fly on but their inflight food is terrible compared to rivals like air asia x  longest ulcc flight i have done was 5 hours long on frontier never again  when are you uploading videos but good job can you fly peach aviation from kix kansai airport thanks i like how it is spelled mum is  thank you for your vid o and informations unfortunatly i found the same price to sydney from berlin on usual compagnies so  bro pls fly to lithuania thankyou  i have done lgw to singapore on norwegian 13 5 hours after the power bank fire on scoot recently you think they would review their in seat power policy that looks horrific  2 hrs  you sound a little bit like the lockpicking lawyer  looks pretty expensive to me just check emirates i fly bkk ams bkk for around 700 euro  lack of free water is a deal breaker for me 12 hours is to long to go on a plane without water i did like the idea of a quiet section  4 32 scootees scootees do you know you can get same price for singapore airlines 1 way sin to fra yes just wait for the sale  bro really said nazi leh mark 6 51 also the meals will definitely be better if you fly from singapore there  idc how uncomfortable this is need this to japan from the central us getting there cheap is so worth it or any asian country really because even in japan you get a good deal for the us dollar has to be the most boring flight video you have shot so far even worse for you flying 12hrs  going in a crampy a320 vueling for 4 5 hours without entertainment in april longest flight i have done in a low cost can you please fly on kuwait airways  just a little aside 2 litres of water a day is a myth you need 2 litres of any liquid and that includes water contained in food as well as dehydrating drinks such as coffee  anybody who flew long haul in the 70s and 80s on a 707 this is luxury and cheaper it is all about the money  i fly often on scoot between singapore and melbourne though it is comparatively shorter at 7 to 8 hours i tend to go for the scoot in silence section where the legroom is a bit more generous during the early days and at quiet times of the year this option was not taken up much so occasionally i get the whole 3 seats to myself where i can lie flat  flew to berlin with scoot few times can not complain i like it  for those on a limited income re long haul travel scoot have come to the party in providing a affordable ticket rate to get from point a to b  if this is all you can afford when traveling then stay home you are more than likely a low class tourist doing more harm than good to wherever you are going those meals looked like dog food i planned and booked for a trip to australia sydney and more in late 2018 by scoot only the scoot flights prices for two persons were good 1000 euros cheap in the early morning of the travel day i became a travel flight information via sms about a massive delay departure from singapore to berlin the aircraft needs many hours more and i had a lot of time before i must go to the airport berlin tegel closed now my mother was the second person her travel was impossible to make after a short talk about the new situation i contacted the scoot hotline and told they there about the massive delay flight for a complete cancelation today i know it was a mistake to cancel the flights the passenger rights say you have the chance to refund the price and flight for free 12 hours later departure after regular time and 10000 kilometers flight range  so basically the same as economy on most major airlines i do not see a lot more on offer here except perhaps for in flight entertainment which a lot of people do not need anyway as they bring their own devices you can get water for free from the bathrooms it is a myth that it is unsanitary and surely the flight attendants would bring you a cup of water if you asked nicely i find it hard to imagine why they would not  omg you missed the most outrageous thing on that scoot flight people are actually prohibited to bring own meal and water on board it stands in scoot rules you adviced to better bring own refreshments but it is againts the rules in fact i can not believe how could you misslead other people so bad  you could buy several bottles of water before taking off in berliner airport so you got it covered i always bring my own water bottle and there are many airports providing free water ive done the gold coast to singapore three times good airlines they are fine get what you pay for and have never had a bad experience nearly 8 hour legs i like to read it is fine  david i miss your expectations the aircraft looked clean and well kept thank you for your time doing this  4 hrs on a budget is ok touch n go but 8 hrs needs something better but a 13 16hrs trip better spoil yourself getting a premium  i ordered a flight on scoot a320 ceo with a route from sin mdc i must say the experience was not really good there were countless of problems i faced durinng this flight and even on changi airport the nasi lemak i ordered has a really dry rice like it wasnt even made properly not only that their water is so little i can barely drink as they did not let any drinks on board they said it was the airline is rule not only that they always have baggage problems all our fragile stuff were not allowed on cabin and so our bags were placed in the baggage along the other ones we brought  the price is not much different with full service turkish airline oman air or emirate  so i prefer the full service one i did 6hrs on jetstar i just wanted to get the f out i would fly on any budget airlines if they are always punctual on the schedule you could bring a disposable bottle and fill it after you passed security checks and before you board the flight thats how i saved on water and jus be bold and bring food up the plane whats the worse that can happened jus throw away the food  i will not torture myself on a budget airline for long haul flight   1 27 aerom xico  i live in singpore i fly scoot around the region and following our recent debacle with sia in frankfurt i wish i would have known about ber scott to sg but under normal circumstances this is an absolute no no regardless of whether i fly solo or with kids  having recently flown from melbourne via thailand to berlin and back in premium economy with a disability and chronic pain on a regular service it was so difficult for me to move walk for 4 days after flying i have made the decision to go business class in future but then with disability it is not really a good choice to try and go cheaply as i pay physically and then wasted hotel time when i get to my destination but i do have many friends who do use scoot services to travel cheaply  flew 14 hours before on a budget airline on airasia paid for two meals  i would gladly take that offer as long as have a window seat everything is fine with me  at singapore airport you go through security with a empty water bottle there is a bubbler at the boarding lounge to refill your water bottle before boarding the plane to sydney and have a good feed at the terminal at singapore plenty of food options  thank you for the efforts i guess i will stay with the traditional airlines that is way too much to handle for such a long haul  i have flown scoot a lot last year when i was based in sg for work the flights to seoul were definitely challenging 6 hours but the shorter ones were totally fine  that nasti lemak looks a bit average ngl i went from perth to london non stop on this plane via qantas i loved every minute on cattle class had mum by my side i am 6ft3 n i still made 16 hours lol what about royal air morocco  4 hours lmao i flew scoot from athens to singapore and was also taken aback with the water issue it seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen that alone will prevent me from flying scoot long haul again for short haul they are great but never again for long haul  a real budget traveler will take an empty water bottle or two through security and then fill it after security from a tab for free one caveat only works in countries where you can safely drink the tab water  ngl the leg room already sold me on the 787 9  did this flight to sydney in december euros1600 return inc checked bag total rip so many babies and those add on prices have also risen they do not allow you to bring your own pot noodles and charge hard for hot water this was the best value flight going though so had no choice before c vid it was luxury flying via china for euros700 return  in april 2012 i have flown waw mct hkt on 737 from enterair we had to refuel at mct but without leaving the plane never again  flew on tui uk 788 from uk to langkawi in malaysia in economy it looks like a bit more room with 300 passengers and food and drinks were included it is a long way but at least we had a cruise to look forward to  i want to fly scoot from singapore to london  when you are young and fit its no problem to travel this way 30 yrs ago i used to fly to aus from the uk in economy in the back of old 747 is on occasion you would get the middle seat no recline against the rear bulk head and as a non smoker but in the smoking area and with no ipads or mobiles etc for good measure i prob paid gbp4000 in today is money still i enjoyed it modern planes and 10percent 20percent of the price shows progress  13 hours bro respect  i guess one can save even more by bringing through security an empty bottle and fill it on the toilet i do not think ber has free water fountains however this is all disgusting who knows what this airlines pay their staff  i have lost my lugage my flight was from singapore to berlin last year juli 2022 it took about a month and seventeen days to receive my lugage back i will never ever take this airlines anymore in the future  believe it or not my worst flight was with swiss from zurich to bangkok last year in june seat 44 never again a sardine in the can has more space  i tried this once on a 9 hour flight from dxb to mnl i am ok with no food and no entertainment but what killed me was the inability to recline the seats  in economy i would not do an 3 hours flight so imagine 13 hours it a no no for me  i did british airways nagoya to heathrow many years ago ever since have rated ba as a low cost carrier now always use jal or ana my longest lcc was 8 hours from singapore to sydney by scoot i was okay with it not sure if i am able to do 13 hours or not lol  eh just buy water at the airport after security or just bring an empty bottle and fill it in the toilet  the point about water is valid to a degree are you sure there was no way of asking for tap water i know for a fact you can do this on other budget airlines also water bottles exist only euros 2 for a bottle uf water laughing in swiss  i would rather pay extra on regular long haul airlines than less on crappy cheap budget airlines do not even fly ryanair or similar in the uk  if you want to sleep on a flight for a longer period then no meals is a big plus no crew to wake you up all the time with food at times which do not make any sense neither from where you departed nor where you are heading to  i flew the norwegian to gatwick on norwegian air very pleasant so much better than scoot  i had a flight from seoul to singapore singapore to amritsar india total 12 hours of flight was not bad though bottled still water costs 9 euros per litre in most average swiss restaurants on the ground  scoot does not offer on the 787s any live tv channels or possibility to stream movies on your phone but and at least before covid they used to have a number of tablets with movies amp episodes to rent for a fee it was on txl sin about 4y ago dunno if they still offer it nowdays i just had my phone full with netflix downloads but there were at least 5passengers who prefered to rent them  so your main complain is a 333 ml water bottle at 3euros  airasia is meals are tasted and selected by the owner the menu has been like that since 15 years ago i love traveling with them but scoot tiger airways and its affiliates meh not the worst but also not the best at least it is better than cebu pacific the plane being 787 also immensely helps the low cost a330 is extremely awful and they squeeze you with 28 pitch in general avoid taking long haul flights from and to notorious begpacking countries going from berlin to world is most expensive city like singapore on budget airline is like walking to a ritz carlton it does not matter and you will not experience the worse part of flying long haul budget airline the crowd sometimes people think crying children are annoying but it is when you are trying to sleep when you have audio video distraction crying children are minor nuisance however poor hygiene begpackers and their youthful emotions oftne times created much more concerning issues  longest i did was 9 5 hours on scoot from sapporo to singapore not that bad until you start running out of water  this plane used to fly to athens before dingapore for less than 80euros if you are a tall person 2 hours was ok flying on scoot but 12 could be unfathomable also not that good food back then but it was interesting as an experience  paying 300euros as single flight does not even seem that good of a deal i spent around 660euros from stuttgart to singapore via a transfer in istanbul for the full flight via turkish airlines with unlimited water and free onboard meals in basic economy scoot sold me a ticket then cancelled it when i turned up at the airport they have no staff everyone is a contractor who knows nothing their maintenance is probably as good as their customer service  2 hour did it in china with spring airline i can still accept 2 hour not any longer to me for any flight longer than 10 hours should be booked in buisness class thats why my family do at least honestly wouldnt really mind it cuz i would just bring my switch or a book to read in the mean time or just sleep and i actually would get the power outlet to charge all my stuff in case anything happens but great video nontheless  if its really cheap and the gap is really big between this flight and a more regular economy one maybe but just for the comfort and features included with other companies and mostly free features i will go with another company than this one even if there is 2 flights  technically it does cost them something to provide you with power through the socket a bit of fuel because that power needs to come from somewhere and that somewhere is the engine generators  was not this channel about silent reviews with captions and steadi cam style shots i liked the style better this is way too in your face  i travelled syd txl in 2018 with scoot by the time we would added on meals seat selection and luggage we were moving so packing light was not an option it came out pretty much on par with any other airline cost wise service was average not bad but not excellent no surprises and in general it got the job done nothing to complain about other than everything being average main reason i would not fly with them again is that for the same money long haul you get an overall better experience or close enough that paying full service is worth it just for not being so average if short haul no frills is all you need though scoot will get the job done well enough absolutely not long haul ryanair though as someone said ryanair is built around explicitly screwing you while being just good enough at the bare bones stuff that people can still convince themselves that it is worth the suffering all states quite publicly by its owner who makes no secret as to the contempt he has for his passengers scoot on the other hand is just an airline trying its best at the budget end and mostly succeeding i would rather walk than give one cent to the tossers running ryanair  denying adjustable head rest is just cruel turning off the electrical outlets is ridiculous by iata rules airlines are obligated to serve you water for free by the way  so i was about to fly from berlin to singapore in jan 2023 and i was ready to get thecheapest tickets since i was on a very tight budget to my surprise at the time of booking in dec 2022 the cheapest option was not scoot but airfrance 600 eur to and back in comparison to 800 eur to and back for scoot with a nice layover in paris normal recliner seat two meals etc i seriously do not get how scoot is a low cost if it costs at least 200 eur or more than a regular airline  huh 330 euros is still half of my salary  scoot on the 787 is a fantastic experience at an amazing price the 787 is a far superior flight experience than a 777 or a330 or worse a 737 you get heaps of choice of seats from rock bottom pricing which of course will have less leg room to a very reasonable extra leg room quiet area and usually very affordable scoot plus scoot runs a very reliable network of flights you can buy food onboard or before you fly at reasonable prices it is easy to choose your luggage requirements wifi is onboard and you can also buy drinks if you can not organise yourself to bring your own entertainment or food that is on you power is available in the seats for a fairly low fee many planes have no power at all the ability to buy what you need means you can fly for as cheap as possible or add on what you need could not be more easier  max on lcc for me is 4 5hrs and yeap airasia is better than scoot  nah thanks i would rather have a stopover and pay dollar100 more and fly with turkish airlines instead  next level of payment for seat for toilet for food delivery you pay for food but not for delivery for smile  if you do not have much money you do not have much choice yes i always look forward to the curries on airasia  11 sgd is not a lot of money because i am from singapore and a lot of stuff is expensive so 11 sgd is not that much money done 7 hrs before not again i tried this airline before and my best advices are get an empty bottle so u can fill it after the security process i got for me a bottle of 1 5 lts  buy an hamburguer or sandwich 3 5 euros in the waiting area u can eat it in the airplane and buy packaged snacks u will feel full bring ur laptop or ipad with downloaded movies from netflix or amazon and bring ur own earphones bring ur portatile charger if u are below 175 cm u wont feel any problem with the seat services is nice i expected a really bad service good luck  will mot fly scoot had 3 very bad experience being overcharged forvsub standard service have flown scoot a few times in various classes honestly if the price is right i would go for scoot again i only fly no more than 8 hours  dude that is the like the demo aircraft they bought from boeing and were like yeah this is good enough  i have flown scoot silence twice in sep 2019 and sep 2022 on the sin syd route i expected to pre order food or pay dollardollardollar on board a little preparation goes a long way if you fill up a water bottle after security compared to my onward journey on ba economy i have to say the scoot air cabin staff are way more customer focussed than their counterparts nothing is ever a problem i would defo recommend scoot for flying on a budget  in 2018 we flew scoot from manila to athens via singapore for less than usd 600 round trip per person no food no bags just seat selection i would personally rather fly a full service airline for that long a flight especially if i need to bring bags but if i just need to get from point a to b and i can one bag the trip i would gladly fly them again  bruh i took this route tokyo singapore berlin it was not even that bad and plan on doing it again in few months so i brought some snacks prior to boarding and bought a drink on board so tell me what are you getting on a full cost carrier that you are not getting here  excellent review will fly scoot definitely well for me i fly scoot very often and it is normal and not bad for a 3 hours flight from singapore to thailand i just booked a flight in scoot to thailand and flying scoot is cheap and excellent why do everyone keep on hating cheap airlines and prefer expensive ones there are very minimal difference between cheap and expensive airlines can i go also manila there was a low cost airline peoplexpress based in newark new jersey they started service april 30 1981 and merged with continental february 01 1987 they flew boeing 727 200 boeing 737 100 200 and 747 100 200 they flew the 747s to london gatwick and brussels and on transcontinental flights i flew them quite a bit they changed for onboard services fifty cents for sodas juice coffee tea peanuts brownies etc snack packs for dollar6 00 on transcontinental and international flights the snack packs were more substantial their 747s had first class they called 1st class premium service i believe they did show a movie on their 747 flights they charged dollar3 00 per checked baggage and carryon no charge even air asia if from malaysia cheaper as cost of fuel still subsidised by govn thai air asia flight amp food more expensive to malaysia aa  i do not mind paying for food and i can bring a book or switch for entertainment as long as it is a widebody i think i can handle it  tried with this flight at feb good flying experience as i bought many many many wi fi coupon  thai smile airways for 1 hour was great they even gave a bottle of water a snack sized sandwich and coffee or tea i will consider them in the future and if you upgrade you get access to the thai airways lounge as for ifes i can survive without if need be i remember when you had to bring a newspaper magazine or book with you if you wanted entertainment  scoot is ok for its price but my problem with them is they are never on time 13 hour is way too long  i fly with them before c19 3x from berlin to bali its very cheap last time around 400usd two way i bring to backpack instant food mana and shaker and thats all watter i was take in toilet wastaffel and done because they menu is crazy overpriced  i fly their 787 9s on asian mid haul flights all the way before the pandemic and started again recently as they resumed their 787 services usually with paid seat upgrades not exactly tall but my knees are bad since most mid hauls in asia are flown using a32xs the 787s are a huge upgrade for me do not get me started on the a32xneos it only saves money for the carriers not for us if they are so efficient like the airbus ads say why are not the tickets cheaper not to mention the narrow body low cost mid hauls are not exactly cheaper than scoot is 787 offerings scoot is asian mid haul prices are still extremely competitive compared to full carriers in asia but long haul is a whole other story and i definitely recommend people fully understand since 3 5 hrs and 13 hrs are totally different i would consider it but just like the summary you get what you pay for  no thank you i will only fly on proper airlines  brutally honest yes shit on the sky i will never pay a dollar for this crampy flight  no thanks i just could not face it appreciate your sacrifice though  modern sadistic torture  just checked lhr to singapore 31mar and singapore airways was cheaper than scoot what a mess  not so different than flying qatar airways to cape town on their 777 recently where the food and drink offering was poor on their cramped 777 give me a window seat and timely water coffee wine and sandwich and i will be just fine power provision could be an issue but forewarned i would be able to make it with spare batteries including laptop but really water is surely a human right and should not be charge for anywhere you failed to mention the seat recline situation how was that based on your review i would say its doable for me so thanks will check it out  faultless review i agree about the water that is a bit rich is there a water bubbler available to refill water bottles on scoot other airlines have them as an aussie when scoot have a sale it is deadset the cheapest way to get to europe by a huge margin so we will definitely be trying to put up with the discomfort the next time we go great review thanks  never never never never i would rather pay more for lufthansa or singapore airlines  any ideas what small camera to bring to film a flight i recall also having the mum is fried rice on a scoot flight from singapore to cebu approx 4 hours and i recall it as being the worst airline meal that i ever had scoot airline is really a low cost airline and i could not imaigne going on a long haul flight with them i recall from my one flight with them that the aircrew was running around on the flight with no idea on what they were doing and which customers asked for service thank you for the review perhaps do not start the video with then this video is not for you as it might put people off actually watching it people might change their minds on low budget long haul after seeing the video or if they have never flown long haul it might help them decide what will be best for them  thank you but not thank you i would prefer to pay a little bit more and pause in the middle of the journey i can think of turkish emirates or qatar for instance  i could never fly 13 hours at any price  my partner and i flew from melbourne to athens return for about dollar650 aud each euros410 including seat selection we brought empty bottles than we filled after security and brought lots of snacks and a tablet with us the cheapest alternative flights that did not involve 2 connections at the time were close to 3 times the price on the 787 9 used between mel lt gt sin there are 12 or so seats that have extra leg room and an adjustable head rest for the cost of standard cheapest seat selection which are well worth the cost if available  in good austrian do kunnt ist mi kasn i will not do that to myself  wow i would fly them short distance only that looked brutal thanks for taking one for the team i flew scoot flight no tr 611 from singapore to bangkok one weeks ago the tray in front of seat was never cleaned or sanitized i was seating near the last row and the toilet smell was leaking even though the toilet door was closed its a really awful experience i think the bottled water has to be 330ml as it needs to fit into their cart standing upright but i do agree that dollar3 for a bottled water is pricey especially when it is not branded water  amazing how they turn it around so quickly for another flight of 12hours it is never worth it to fly scoot will only take scoot if the flight is less than 2 hours good god i would never fly that distance on a shitty budget carrier like that what a really unpleasant experience that would have been i guess you get what you pay for  i would fly on a lcc on this route ams lgw with easyjet 45min no lcc on longer flights for me  great video but really sounds scary d u did awesome  i flew from berlin to baltimore with playairlines no usb no media or wifi  fortunately i had my powerbank with me and a lot of movies netflix offline  i nearly accidentally flew on scoot dollar2000 aud to fly 8 hours to singapore from melbourne on scoot outrageous thank god i spotted it singapore airlines trying to cram scoot into people that are actually booking singapore airlines  we maybe nice but we are brutaly true for those who love getting charged for 4dollar for a small cup of water from scum bags who scan and take your water preflight rude staff was the last option but never again  connection from sin to melbourne may be on sq rather than scoot itself  nope i do not think so even flying single aisle plane with full service for 2 hours trip is a no no to me if i can avoid it but unfortunately it is the reality now most airlines now use single aisle planes for medium haul in malaysia i did fly airasia for domestic trips but that is only 45 minutes flight  sorry not sure what your food standards are but air asia was not better than what you described on scoot at least on short haul pre ordered meals and there too water is that tiny bottle and air asia not sure if they even gave cookies w the meal i think just water  very nice onboard report greetings from japan  never had a bad flight experience with scoot between australia and singapore but of course it is a lot less shorter than flying with them to berlin  inspite of being low cost airlines scoot service is quite satisfied but regarding the meal i felt that airlines need to improve a lot recently flew frm phuket to singapore and it was a good trip  i get that it is an ultra low cost airline but being singaporean having no food or meals and bring 13 hours it i was flying with them i would expect a bit more and you have to pay for the plug socket  scoot in summary a total disgrace to singapore airlines  bro i never went 13 hrs but i took that plane tho what ever the airline longer than 5 6 hours becomes bothersome for me 12h on a full budget carrier is not fun  13 hours flight without food or drinks no entertainment oh man it is torturous if we take 2 3 hours flights on a low cost flight that is fine but for more than 3 hours you must look for a plane that is a bit tolerable never buy the tomato chicken ragout from scoot pre ordered meal had terrible experiences and family member who had it fell sick for a few days  wow i flew on one they crammed as many seats as possible do not even serve water even if you are dying flew scoot from melbourne to singapore during covid in december 2021 flights were empty and literally you can lie down on seats  charging passengers to use even power outlets no thanks  headrest covers look awful i feel the not so good quality of nasi lemak was there just to irritate the malaysians xd joke only dun take it too srsly where is your strange english accent coming from  not more than 2 hours  when i searched trip reports i always see simply aviation up top on the list hopefully someday i could be up top too from malaysia fantastic value take your own snacks amp water small blanket and wear more comfortable pants not denim jeans thank you for the insight  i did this annually ever since the service started no issue at all its a sleep all way journey i did not even ordered meals board read sleep wake up arrive in berlin same as return  loving the new intro in the latest brutally honest episodes fantastic video as usual  have flown scoot singapore to sydney amp back a number of times including their second ever flight pay the extra for scoot in silence they are fine service was good there short haul flights are not nearly as good  my only objections are the charges for power and water is water poured in a cup at least free  personally this is a no for me i do not think i could do an ultra long haul on a budget airline mainly due to the leg room i am 6ft3 my longest low cost is 3 hours from d sseldorf to manchester during my 2018 study abroad my longest in regular economy is milan mxp to montreal yul which is 9 hours and it was tight  i would try scoot premium 3 2 3 upfront  air asia is much better i have a similar route for june but premium economy with singapore lisbon via germany singapore and 4days after new zealand i will be able to try the new zealand skycoach but unfortunately de flight back from singapore to frankfurt the a380 was replaced by a 777 and i specifically booked to catch the doubledecker but well let me know if you want me to make some clips ahahah thanks for the clip  i once travelled on scoot undoubtedly my worst flight i boarded the flight early and very thirsty having never traveled on such flight i casually asked the crew for water only to learn it was paid surprising but i said ok give it to me the crew then responded that beverage facilities only open became at cruising altitude i thought i could board off get water from terminal and come back only to be told that i will not be able to board back so there i sat for 2 hrs thirsty af finally bought water only to be handed a 300 ml tetra pak of water views outside the window were nice though  its not bad when you take into account the stop over times i spent 10hours in toronto airport which was a horrendous experience going to lisbon from halifax which took over 26 hours a total disgrace  i have literally just booked a ticket from athens to taipei via singapore with scoot looking forward to it i had a thought with many of the passengers taking less luggage than usual often only hand luggage less people eating no entertainment system would this flight consume considerably less emotions than standard long haul  i believe scoot is the low cost brand of singapore airlines let me put it that way next week i am getting 60 nowadays i can afford booking singapore airlines at least premium economy but i am an old fart now made good money in my life when i was 25 wishing to explore asia i would have been glad having something like scoot bt that was way before ryanair changed it all however when my son now in his twenties recenently travelled to california from germany i fronted the 1500 euros to buy him a premium ticket on lufthansa there is some limit to all and scoot is not an option but i fully understand there are a lot of people around which simply cannot afford lufthansa or singapore airlines good luck to them surving such a flight so what i flew sq 12 hours before the days of in flight entertainment on a 707 literally the same experience with a 3 course meal scoot also flies from and to ool goldcoast  no way in hell would i ever get on that flight looks absolutely horrible maximum 4h hours without anything i look at the food not nice and water it is expensive if i had to or it was way cheaper than a standard airline then yes given yr able to take yr own food and drink supplies this makes a better yes  the price also does not look right i can get full service carrier via a transit airport to have similar price airasia food was amazing when i first tried also pre ordered at a good price i clearly recall last year i got this flight for 230euros in total for both directions berlin to bangkok with a short stay in singapore was fine for the price but not for more money is this still commitment or already masochism  i went on swoop airlines boeing 737 800 from alberta canada to cancun mexico it was 5 hours and 30ish minutes that is my longest low cost airline flight  scoot has the most unpleasant looking pricey questionable food i have ever consume on a flight  12 hours you will never get back bro can you try new route by batik air malaysia from kl to melbourne with 737 max eur 350 vs eur 2600 so figure it  2 40 scoot also flies to coolangatta ool which services the gold coast  norse from berlin to the us is the maximum i miss the old tegel airport sure the new berlin airport looks flashier but it is not as cozy as the ol tegel oh well at least there is the mega airport in the german capital of frankfurt  4 hours i seen this company on tik tok and there was clouds in the damn plane  wait you have actually changed the intro and started talking instead of subtitles looks like i have not seen your videos for a long time  thanks i not book at all i be very close to book a trip to bangkok via singapore but never with bullshit air scott weird concept if you book everything you are over 1000eur in may singapore airlines charges 876 for the same dates  good  flew from singapore to tokio at the beginning of feb this year with scoot the overall experience was ok but from singapore to tokio scoot osnt that much cheaper than e g singapore airlines next time i will consider them instead but as someone who flew quite a lot with scoot i can say especially on short to medium haul flights the experience is quite good for what you pay  we are already booked to travel from singapore to berlin premium economy you are quite right as i too feel i do not need games and movies a book and a good rest is more than sufficient for me again next time i would probably travel economy no babies section thanks for taking the time to enlighten travellers about scoot  idea trip report hifly i loved that when you mentioned karachi while flying over and shown the beautiful night view of city lots of love from melbourne australia i am from islamabad pakistan but living in australia now also good to see scoot flights experience as i am flying to europe by same airline in may with my family i got unbelievable deal for whole family tickets appreciate your effort  scoot is the worst and most cramped without any leg room at all even the lavatories are designed for micro size people do not fly scoot unless you are below 5ft most horrible experience in flight  i flew that exact route once and then connected to sydney while the price was great i hope to never have to fly scoot again it is the worst service i ever had by far and i also was very annoyed by the price of water and power outlets and lack of entertainment i can handle all that on a short flight but in these very long haul flights these little details make it a very unpleasant experience  pure water ok gluten free vegan halal  would significan notly more berlin ber videos be possible and more frequent regular   really good reportage thanks   3 hours max i would always fly low cost however i would not consider it on long haul flight my most recent was on wizzair between abu dhabi and vienna scoot is not bad either i tried them before from chennai to singapore glad to see you are back with more brutally honest videos quick question do you do all the animation yourself maps intro etc looks awesome  seeing a heavy dreamliner performing the steep turn just after takeoff in berlin is just awesome great views d  no babies class is an amazing feature i will not fly over an ocean in a 17 seat it is business class or nothing i cannot afford to buy business class tickets but i have mastered the mileage game so my international flights are always free  13 hours flight without in flight entertainment and no usb charging if i can not bring a few power banks with me i would probably be bored to death  i flew singapore airlines first class suite to frankfurt in january i had a little more leg room  had to catch 2 scoot flights from vizag to manila a 737 and a 321 my god it was the worst time i ever had to spend cheap sure but the quality was atrocious would never fly them ever again and not just that they charged me exorbitant fee for my bag being 3kgs overweight  water should be a basic human right  a long time ago i flew london to sydney australia return on air asia x i bought a very cheap blackberry playbook for the flight and a new jack reacher book i am 190cm and about 15kg lighter the trip was alright not really that much worse than other long haul economy flights these days the only part of the plane you would get me in long haul would be the premium part or the extra leg room seats i just flew ryanair 4hr35m tenerife to manchester and they would not let me book extra leg room seats as i was travelling with my children i reckon i am fine for 3 hours of that crampedness any more is just too much for me these days  just no  did it back in 2018 it was brutal on the way back i paid more for the quiet section my row was empty so i was able to lie down and get quite a good sleep  what da hail you have to pay a holy dime to stay hydrated on scoot even when they do not allow water past security is this how a budget airline makes you pay more  i flew ool to singapore on scoot their cheap seats killed my back and their cheap food made me sick great flight  for as low as under euros199 it is a great deal  one hour and that is pushing it i flew scoot from athens to bali via singapore in april 2022 for just euros340 both ways and could not care less about the lack of the features you get from other long haul airlines it was just perfect love scoot  pay not much ger nothing  12 hours lowcost is definitely a challenge can you fly on royal air maroc 787 9 long haul it would be a great review  pay to use power source omg getoutathere triple challenge to review myairline  about water in venice for example 0 75 l of water cost 6 or 7 euros  the quiet seats sound like an amazing idea get the power outlet bring some extra food and this would be a very tolerable flight  the best pre purchased meals are to be found on pegasus airlines do amp co incredibly reasonable prices as well  flew them in june of last year when i needed a o w flight to sin on short notice paid through the nose for that i thought i had done everything right but ended up not receiving the food i had ordered you will not even get a cup of water for free fill up an empty bottle in the washroom germany is tap water is great scoot really is the world is worst airline the staff cannot fix any issues if we give you a meal it will be deducted from our salary we do not have to give you water we are registered in singapore the crew does not know the website either they are just hired guns with no strong ties to the customer experience  tbh i do not see too much of a problem in the lack of in flight entertainment but the lack of wi fi is bad and water just water howdys from a person with kidney issues  i have flown on pia from canada to pakistan and it is not a cheap flight however the product resembles scoot is long haul a lot  airasia x kul to tehran already discountiuned in 2018 it was a 8 hrs flight but i enjoyed it on the return to kl i was able to sleep on the whole middle row myself to be honest air asia is paid catering are much better than many other ordinary airlines just take a good book with you and download a few netflix films on your ipad it wont be that bad regarding the food never once in my life have i had a meal on an airline which i would call good low cost or not though to be honest the seats look terrible like on a bus  not on your life great vids   watched this video 28feb23 checked google flights for economy tickets on the same route from 10mar23 returning 20mar23 scoot costs euros1 100 bare bones if you fly via zrh with swiss an economy ticket with meals drinks blankets ife checked luggage costs euros949 why would anyone want to fly with scoot btw commitment to a good deal is the nicest way to describe this bdsm experiment  12 hours but it has to be a night flight and reach the destination by morning so i can sleep 3 4 of the flight the rest of the entertainment would be an ipad and steamdeck if i fly scoot for 6 hours and less i usually book the normal isle or window seat and for 6 hours i book their scoot because i want to sleep more comfortably  i am impressed with your commitment can not imagine any prima donna reviewers following suit  i am 6 4 193cm and there is no way i would take a flight like this one  this looks like a nightmare after my flights with singapore airlines in business class 2 months ago  you are correct you get what you pay for scoot and air asia are both superb low cost carriers asias version of ryanair making travelling more fun for less  we did narita to bangkok on scoot is 787 6 hours we thankfully upgraded to sccotbiz and got a little more room and a free bad meal but at least the seat was okay we go to singapore frequently so we have taken scoot quite a few times if the flight is on a 787 and is less than 3 hours i can handle it they at least have decent seat pitch if it is on their a320 which has a whopping 28 seat pitch i can handle a little over an hour singapore to penang other than that we look for mainline airlines on an upcoming trip we chose to use thai round trip from sing to bangkok if you take account of baggage fees that you have to pay on scoot the thai price was only about dollar25 more well worth it  scoot is my favourite low cost airline in 2019 i scooted from sin to ath and enjoyed the flight as i was on a code share sq ticket meals drinks and a souvenir blanket were included yes i was allowed to take the blanket with me the flight was overnight and the legroom was not quite enough i am 196 cm tall but otherwise it was a pleasant trip that i would happily take again  scoot and other low cost carriers in asia forbids passengers from bringing their own food on board how else would they be able to sell 330ml bottles of water at sgd3 and tiny portions of unappetizing food at sgd15 if they did  nice 1 the longest i take was 8 hours is not scoot the airline where you are forbidden from bringing your own food onboard  charging for water on a long haul fly should be illegal i did not know and i was totally dehydrated from perth to singapore on my way to athens just as well was the shorter leg of the trip  low cost carrier for me uhm probably 6 9 hours as i flew airasia from klia to gold coast however it was cramped each time i was considering taking scoot for the berlin singapore kuala lumpur route pricewise it just was not worth it if i include 1x checked luggage 2x food 2l of water and power outlet all of which are necessary to me the price turned out the same as with better airlines qatar or emirates so to me it never made sense to choose scoot on this route also a big downside is the missing inflight entertainment at least make it available as an add on  providing water on long haul flights for an affordable price should be mandatory one of these days someone will pass out due to dehydration will the mess be worth it giving people a liter of water with some crackers will cost them 1 euro but saving money on ife is a good idea it is definitely not mandatory for people who have their own devices  i was fly on shaheen air semi low cost carrier of pakistan now defunct airline in 2014 skt jed skt on a330 amp a320 without ife but they provide free food and water i also fly on fly dubai on skt dxb tif route without food and ife in 2017 so 10 hours in shaheen air and almost 6 hours excluding transit time at dxb spent on fly dubai  where is the in flight entertainment and you have to pay for the food and drinks  scoot sux u are very brave i fly scoot from singapore to bali 4 hrs it was pathetic maybe i will try to fly with scootbut really not on such a long flight do they want extra money for using their toilets too and won t ever fly from this airport catastrophy the first berlin airport that is not in berlin that no one ever needed that costed much much more than it should have cost  beatiful video can you fly with nordica new a320  i will not fly a lcc for more than 5hrs scoot also fly their 787 is to perth  tried out vietjetair for 3 hours from saigon to chengdu and back it was miserable vj is launching its australia mel syd route so i would imagine a zero entertainment a330 would be terrible for everyone i is be fine with a long route like that if it is just me i could fly a budget airline like scoot for as long as i need to 12 13 hours no problem it is only if i fly with family or friends that i would feel guilty and pay the extra amount to travel on a legacy for a more comfortable trip for them  322 euros for such a service is not a normal price i would swallow my sleeping pill just after take off wake me up just before landing   2 00 not every aussie is richies okay every flights to europe costs a tons can see why this would never fly out of vienna  i did syd bkk on thair air asia x never again how is it even legal for carriers not to give out free water on long hauls  it also used to operate from chennai maa to singapore in 2018 i was in scoot for 2 hr flight from bkk to sin and made a full plan to kill the ceo of scoot  really boring experience i traveled in the same route in same airline in 2018 but i had no choice otherwise i had to select terrible saudi airline maximum 3 hrs  i could not fly on scoot for that many hours unless i was in one of the comfy reclining seats and had brought food and plenty of water at least they do not charge you to use the toilets yet  this airline is a joke but i flew with them in 2019 from honolulu to osaka for 140 usd 15 usd for a seat in the quite zone which really was not a quite zone because somehow families with small children ended up here they did not allow passengers to eat of drink their own sandwiches and drinks and even cabin announcements were made that according to singapore law it was not allowed to consume your own food or drinks in the end nobody on board cared what do they want to do on a flight from the usa to japan  at early days air asia kul to lon standsed or gatwick i do not even remember 16 hours did the same last summer legroom was to small for a 190cm chubby human but you get what you pay cost me only 700euros roundtrip including extra luggage for 70euros  the dreamliner is not so bad besides i got my google play selection as well as a neck holder for my device and a zendure supertanker but the seat pitch would put me off after flying sq amp nz in november  this is the worst airline ever in the history of aviation i travelled from singapore to korea and it was the longest flight of my life due to their poor services and poor condition of aircraft thank you soo much as always for the best reviews ever  but absolutely no way i would fly 12hrs on this thing even if it was for free  why you have to punish yourself of taking this low cost flight for duration of 12 hours if turkish airlines one of the best airlines in europe offers less than 700 euros return from fra to sin with a full services  3 hours max  the new intro  oliverghan footballer men men berlin i would not do it if you were to pay me double the fare  scoot is getting from bad to worse  airasia is inflight meal make even a full service airlines mean a shame like how sq is regional economy class meal served it is like snacks oh my here i am flying sq from zrh to dps still complaining about how a downfall their service is i think i will not survived in this flight but if they could sell ber sin return with 20 kg baggage 450euros i might give it a try my longest lcc flight was kul kix with airasia it was ok for me try jetstar airways their b787 and the service was wayyy better and water is free does not the livery look like ice cream  there was a point when norwegian flew between london and singapore scoot still services the gold coast ool in australia but only until july 17 this year so technically it still has a third destination but for a short time only  i completely enjoy your videos your diction added with your honesty is an absolute music to ears u speak what is meant scoot charging to charge a phone is such a robbery i wud never fly this airline on a long haul thank you for your honest reviews it always helps in choosing what one wants simple   4 5 hrs would be the maximum i would be able to bear if its an under 5 hours flight i might give it a go but for longhaul flight no way  so now they allowed passengers to bring their own food drinks before the pandemic it was forbidden cmiiw what a horrible flight  whoever made this video thank you you are so detailed especially with the audio narration wish the videos were more like this  was on one of them to perth yesterday mate i would never fly low cost long haul  it is quite empathetic to make euros look like something valuable to waste on a lion air is a economy class basic very interesting video as you said you get what you paid for lot of passangers are booking flights without any information about an airline and its service then they re surprised and complaining so it might be helfpful to collect informations about an airline before you book  really interesting video how low can they go with standards nah i hate scoot even fot short haul my go to is airasia or citilink no i will not fly scoot on such long flight i flew from singapore to sydney on an overnight flight the seat was very uncomfortable an i had sore back and neck on arrival i bring a waterjug thats around 2 of those water bottles  not in a million years avoid them like the plague i would rather pay more for a reasonable flight  who pays for the power just use your powerbank  there is even ryanair better agree about airasia food is better had a flight from berlin to bkk with scoot in 2022 and it was only 280euros roundtrip want to have these prices back haha ideally never but if push comes to shove 3 hours max i would not agree about the charging ports they are almost never existant on ulccs so this is a bonus to have plus if your business model is based on absolute minimal costs someones gotta pay for the installation maintenance and extra fuel burn from having them just do not use them if you do not have to  their 787 800s also flies to perth every day  hi simply aviaton can you try new company airlines in malaysia myairline  8 19 you have to you pay to use the power outlet never flying this airline i flew scoot from icn tpe around 7 years ago it took about 2 and a half hours suffice it to say that was long enough  thanks for this report perfect as usual  i would fly scoot just for the silence sector  scoot is ok for short haul but not really long haul no more than 4 hours and yes i would have tablet loaded with movies and tv is shows and food and drink  maybe i would fly with full service airline so i can charge my electronic device and entertain myself flying the low cost airline is okay but only for 3 hours maximum last year i did a 8 hour budget airline flight on norse from berlin to newark and honestly it was fine the movies were free the plane was brand new the legroom was fine certainly no worse than a regular airline the only thing i had to pay for was a meal which was dollar20 and honestly kinda tasty but considering the ticket was dollar289  it was well worth it  optimally 90m maybe 5h 6h transcon trans canada at most i would probably say above 4 hours starts to become a bad experience for me i flew ryanair for that long with my knees pressed against the seat in front really uncomfortable by the end of it awesome video btw  i genuinely think i would be able to handle this lol before the pandemic every other christmas break my parents would take me to china since that is where they grew up and my last visit had been when i was 12 years old every single flight i took i would literally just starve myself for 12 hours straight since i was and still am a pretty picky eater and airplane food really just does not appeal to me in general air china is entertainment system was not all that interesting to me either as it did not have games and all the movies were for grown ups and i had no headphones they did provide pillows except i also have problems with those too it is that i literally cannot sleep on a warm pillow and it is why at home i use a sofa cushion as my pillow since it stays cool for longer i still tried to sleep though i would usually just lie down on my mom is lap the next seat over and close my eyes except i was never actually able to fall asleep doing that having flown scoot 1 year ago i swore never never never ever again even allowing for you get what you pay for in life they are a disgrace abusive shameful airline stay away from them  flying scoot for long haul is more of a punishment unless you know you have some to expect at your destination but then you have to fly back on that same cattle car aircraft to get back home whatever relaxation to be had is gone out the door but i can understand if others are willing to put up with it but lack of water on the flight for free that is pretty low i hope they do not act like this with their maintenance of their aircraft  i sat on a short kul sin flight on scoot in an exit row and it felt never ending mind you i would love to try this  more airlines should do what scoot does on their long haul aircraft having a silent cabin is great because one time on a flight there were babies crying so much all the time i have flown scoot from sydney to singapore 3 times and on to bangkok once the service is fine as long as you do not expect much i flew once in what they at the time called business class and that was a fail priority boarding not done priority disembarkation not done free wifi broken but it was dollar3aud more so i was not complaining  no power unless you pay my massive anker power bank finally gets to see some action  would you fly scoot hell to the fucking no terrible experience i flew the exact same plane 9v ofi when it was 2 months old and the cabin was already in terrible condition  absolutely now way i would pay for electric outlet long haul without in flight entertainment is a no from me just checked and it would be cheaper to take quatar from edinburgh to singapore with layover in doha than scoot with layover in berlin ridiculous charging for water on a long haul should also be illegal  flappy bird dude that game has been removed if scoot offers flappy bird its good enough i flew from gold coast to singapore with scoot one time and i love the amount of leg space there is in the scoot silence and peacefulness but flying 7 hours on a red eye flight without entertainment can be dead boring next time i will download movies to my device  it was the cheap passengers that wanted the lowest fare for creation of no thrill airlines of course you have to pay for expensive foods if you paid cheap tickets we have plenty of cattle class airlines in the u s spirit frontier southwest i do not feel sorry for poor people suffering  i flown once on scoot 787 from singapore to kl and never again the plane was is such a bad state worse plane i ever been on the arm rest was attached to the seat by silver tape the wall panels were held in place also by silver tape the seat in front of me was broken and when someone sat in it it tilted completely to the left the wings on the plane were 6 shades of gray never again only time i ever felt scared on a plane i am a frequent travel i wish berlin would see full service carriers like singapore airlines emirates and etihad airways ber should get many more full service long haul flights apart from qatar airways and united airlines services  most low cost is not long haul so you would rarely get the opportunity to endure it for 13 hours i think that scoot do a slightly more upmarket seat which is called scoot buisness but it is more like premium economy   the price is right means that the total cost inclusive of adequate food water power outlet luggage entertainment is lower than the alternative i would certainly fly scoot if the price is right  honestly they seem very reasonable and they do have some impressive fares between australia and asia but thats just me the only thing i am concerned about is water i think thats a bit too extreme everything else seems tolerable i can bring my own food to my desired liking the seats do not look cramped and the lack of blankets i can dress accordingly or bring my own entertainment i can pack a book and reduce my dependency on a power socket but bringing water is a hassle since youll need to find someplace to fill it up after security and ensure you have enough for such a flight water is inexpensive to provide to pax  having no ife is not such a big deal back in the day ife on a b747 meant a movie projected onto a bulkhead screen so only some passengers got a good viewing angle and the audio was piped through tubes to headphones amp quality of the audio was atrocious and you could listen to radio shows etc through a menu system so most people brought books to read  excellent review david  i flew athens singapore and had a 13 hour layover in a pay for use lounge i then flew to sydney it was cheap and cheerful and no issues  i spent 3 hours on scoot last year never again  did boston to paris via iceland on play airlines 5 5 hours plus another 3 longest narrow body i have flown on overseas since i was 4 and flew lufthansa 707 to germany back when flying was civilized i would say it was so good i would fly another 10 hours with them great legroom and awesome crew and prices on board were very good  my longest flight on a lowcost airline was jinair from clark to seoul and it wasnt all bad there was purchasable food onboard but no plug or entertainment but i slept through the entire 4 hr flight since it was 2 am  my flight was ok sin ath  if ryanair would offer longhaul flights i think this is what it would look like i do not think i would fly on an airline like this for more than 4 or maybe 5 hours  flew london to bangkok last september cheapest flight was on scoot and it was direct but i decided to pay gbp40 more to fly with gulf air with a transfer via bahrain it was a great choice cheap no frills airlines are great for short haul but intolerable for 10 hour flights  i loved that thunderstorm while landing my longest low cost flight so far was 5 hours bud dxb onboard a wizzair a321neo but at your flight at least you got the thunderstorm for free upon landing xddddd my longest flight that i have ever been on was 10hr long and it felt like i was sitting in the flight for ever i honestly strongly disagree on classifying scoot as low cost or even ultra low cost same exact thing with nearby jetstar the biggest supporting fact to this is that those two low cost long haul carriers are still in business while norwegian has gone backrupt those two airlines scoot amp jetstar which are always mentioned as example of low cost long haul thanks to the 787 appear to be low cost because the main comparison is to their parent companies they are the eurowings of asia oceania pretty much they are not low cost they are lower cost compared to very high prices of their mainline high standard full service parent airlines singapore airlines qantas and lufthansa  tbh depends on the plane if it was a 747 200 or this kind of stuff i could fly it forever a 737 5 hours max  does not scoot ban from taking outside food source   longest flight with a low cost carrier sun country airlines from msp to puj 4 5 hrs did singapore to melbourne on scoot 7 hours and that is the maximum time i would be on an lcc bruh literally i can not be more thankful to you for putting the glimpse of my home city karachi 9 19 and i bet you have eagle eyes you even noticed the airport from high above can not wait to see you at karachi do try the new airlines of pakistan lots of love and keep making these superb trip reports and brutally honest reviews  flyscoot is better than airasia but airasia win for the meal price 3 times cheaper  i took this flight from singapore to berlin return in 2019 and paid sgd 545 or 380euros base fare and i agree with your whole assessment with the exception of in seat power power supply is not a basic necessity and most people bring their power banks so scoot charging for it seems like fair game as a low cost carrier i especially agree with your assessment on the price of water and quality of food i do not understand why they can not emulate airasia is quality also i paid extra for scoot in silence and i can not recommend it enough seats had more legroom but more importantly you were guaranteed no screaming infant in that section of the cabin or unruly child kicking the back of your seat certainly helps with anxiety in that regard scoot may be a better option compared to other airlines especially sq where their amenities quality and portion of food in economy class have been declining since the resumption of travel but their prices have increased substantially anyway thank you for providing a fairly balanced review of scoot is long haul  depends can you bring food onboard  not only is ber to mel 13 h 7 h it is also a 20h layover in singapore  well i guess unless there is a euros200 difference i am not flying them if you can not sleep during this flight it is going to be a long 13h i have been to berlin and athens with this airline  i think i would go for max 3 4 hours maybe 5 but thats really maybe would have to be such a huge price difference or other flight would be with long layover and etc 12 hours in low cost never otherwise nice video i like this series  i do not think the buy on board prices were bad at all a 500ml bottle of water is 6euros in frankfurt airport pricing will not save you any money  hey a cabin were baby is are not allowed in i would take that i am greek australian living in greece but planning to move to australia i want to go there beforehand and i have been trying to find cheap tickets i was planning on flying with scoot because of the cheap price and as im not the most wealthy person i thought that it was a great deal before seeing reviews as singapore stopped flights from athens to there so scoot is one of the only airlines that connects greece to southeast asia directly air china costs 1 560e per person but honestly i think i will just go with emirates i do not think i can survive in that cabin with no amenities and no free food water and entertainment would rather pay more i flew from seattle to frankfurt on condor not anymore never again the legroom is horrible food as well they do have entertainment screens but they offer only 2 free movies and if you need more you have to pay 10euros for nothing literally the worst experience  thanks david for introduce karachi pakistan where my residence is max 5 hours never ever no no never that is too much scoot from ber to sin i know i have an egg on the move and in return they have a price that is far too high for what is on offer or the other carriers are too cheap  sounds good flight to me serves a population that wants to fly purchase your own food before you board  and bring a warm coat etc to sleep in   such a shame about the mediore food you would expect better from a singaporean carrier of all things even a budget one especially as air asia really do a fantastic job i have flown on air asia and air asia x and their meals have always been fantastic value and something i actively look forward to when flying with them  how about 0 ya i would spend 0 wow that was a cheap cheap flight hi pls try fitsair of srilankas low cost airline i fly business class 90percent of the time if available but this one time i took scoot from philippines to singapore and boy did i feel miserable i am also 191cm and 250lbs i paid to board 1st but was the last to board  is not it forbidden to bring your own food and water aboard scoot even if you have to buy expensive bottled water after passing airport is security but i think it is still cheaper than onboard scoot anyway i am 63 and i would never ever squeeze me in such a seat for 13 hrs thrombosis assured  me and my brother took the exact same flight the cost was the only good thing about this flight but you have to pay 11 dollar for the most shitty food you will ever get on an airplane even lufthansa serves better food thanks for making this video i love your brutally honest videos yes scoot  when you are used to fasting the food problem is not the inconvenience the water thing is a robbery and the on board entertainment well it is a low cost airline and you can not wait long i would not travel with them regardless of whether it was attractively priced prepaid food is better in every way on low cost turkish airlines  i would never do it but i watched the video anyway  maybe short haul flights but not long hauls i do not appreciate the cost of water and power outlets thank you sir for the option to share us your report  i probably will have some ptsd after that 13 hours flight this is what flying long haul with ryanair easyjet wizz or spirit would look like shudders  i do not think the power is free at all my guess is they are not running that on batteries but on jet fuel that is converted to electricity in that case it is expensive electricity  im an alcoholic so i do not care ill take the cheapest flight then get wasted and fall asleep what a shameee these airlines should bankrupt i hate low cost carriers they changes the way of flying  the only way i would fly a discount airline that kind of distance is in their premium cabin otherwise i will pay the extra couple of hundred bucks for more comfort an entertainment system free meals and all the water i want  that is the saddest economy class i have ever seen hats off and i am already upset because i have to fly with norwegian from stockholm to helsinki next week   10 47 that is not entirely true the power outlets themselves cost money to install and maintain but the price they are charging is very high  great review of scoot david i fly with scoot quite often as they are based in singapore and you really pay for what you get the cabin crew are quite good imo  tomorrow i will give scoot a try flying scootplus from hangzhou to kl for around 410 aud one way  my family tried to check the price to book scoot and jetstar last year when we went to sg from manila ph it was very high compared to singapore airlines so we just booked singapore airlines instead  not more than 3 hours d maximum time is about 10 hours on thomas cook scandinavia from cancun to copenhagen it was awful was either really hot or really cold the food was the best part but they did not come round offering drinks i was second to last row so i could grab some snacks and water though the orange juice for the breakfast was still frozen solid  i see you could only afford scoot because you maxed out the budget on that sick intro  great flight imagine you did not pre ordered meal you will be training for fasting on board  my maximum would be 4 hours with easyjet ryan air and co not longer than 3 hours longhaul only in a premium cabin probably as the legroom in economy is already tight with full fare carriers i can bring my own food or purchase it plus i have my tablet anway  i did the sin mel flight in the middle seat it was not that bad but god damn you are crazy for doing 13 hours on scoot  bring an empty one litre bottle through security and fill it up before boarding for dollar10 you can buy more than enough bread cheese meat granola bars and snacks for the flight 50ml bottles of vodka cost about dollar1 at a liquor store and are legal to carry on board  scoot apparently does not allow you to eat your own food onboard which is mind blowing to me  i would fly scoot just for the experience of flying a new airline i said to myself all along that yeah would pay for it but asking money to use power outlet literally the energy is generated by the engines if noone pays for it they wont just turn it off would never fly with them because of this  scoot delivers what it says it will deliver except that its prepaid meals are not very good the cabin crew is also aloof air asia gives a similar deal but with delicious meals and friendly cabin crew they also offer their premium flatbed seats which are similar to business class comfort i look forward to more long haul flights being introduced by air asia  talking about water look at how much qatar charges you at doha during transit paying for water on a transit hub is stupidity considering how high they price their tickets to add to that the security makes you dispose your pre bought water bottles at entry  after reading scoot airline web site and the part about food and drink i think travellers will be in for a huge surprise in that it says consumption of food and drink from outside of the flight is not allowed to be eaten or drunk on board i love to know how the flight crew would in force this rule as i could see many people on board having their own stuff strange this was not mentioned in this review  unfortunately i am flying with them in april from sin to ath so thank u so much for showing so i can be prepared especially for the water  if the price is good and flight available in our country i will fly with sccot 322 eu for a one way ticket ai not really cheap either  ah sfi  i want felix he does not talk  budget airlines are budget airlines basically an air taxi point a to b everything other than your body shoes an the clothes you are wearing comes with an extra fee  bon voyage  i stay max 6 houers in basic economy class great work love this series  i was surprised by sas with their free tea coffee but expensive water like scoot after a 4 5hr at the start of the journey with no vouchers i would have expected to get a cup of water on board  13 hours i would not set foot in a 787 nightmare liner aka screamliner for 13 seconds give me an a350 anyday  i went to australia and back for less than euros600 with this airline on this route if all you want is to get from point a to point b then its perfect it is simply a long haul ryanair thank you scoot for making worldwide travel available for everyone also the same route with other carriers was at least double the price so not worth it for just some unnecessary luxury extras  their is no way i could take a flight like this 7euros for power wow i will pass  respect would be ok with it if i could bring my own food i remember flying etihad from belgrade to singapore in 2018 for 350 euros good old times  great review david if it were short haul scoot would be a good choice if prices are low but long haul probably not  6 hours edit scoot silence is genius and every airline needs it 1 point for scoot 5 hours top  flying with scoot in may glad to hear they have wifi as i will have work to do  i am flying to singapore in a little over a week but to xsp and not sin  low cost over 2h is a big no  wait i thought scoot prohibits bringing your own food and water on board  great video my flight from berlin to athens on scoot during covid for 50euros was enough for me to figure out i rather fly other airlines on long haul flights sometimes if you look up the prices the base ticket without food luggage or entertainment is just a bit cheaper than other carriers not worth it in my opinion  if i could get one of the recliner seats for less than economy on a full service airline i would definitely fly with them if that was not an option it would have to be cheap enough that i could still buy things like meals and an aisle seat for significan notly less money hundreds of dollars less than others  yep if the price is right i think it is worth considering scoot otherwise nah  no tv on bord it is low cost but 12 h they can add tv nah i will definitely choose airasia over scoot  love the sound of an airline banning baby is from sections of aircrafts i would pay the premium for not sitting near a baby as carol burnett once said to a passenger excuse me sir are you flying in the not frills section  well yes ok then get your foot of the rug  i would not spend a minute on a low cost carrier i only chose traditional airlines  i mean sure flights from europe to singapore are really expensive so yeah i would still probably fly with them woah 13 hours is insane i flew them for 8 hours and was already regretting it good job though  great review i have flown this exact route myself back in 2018 from the old tegel airport and just as you say you get what you pay for and in my opinion scoot makes this very clear in the booking process as for the power outlets just use a power bank if you are traveling with checked in bags it may actually be worth comparing flights with other non lcc airlines as it may actually cost more or less the same what next charge extra for using the restroom  ok but like i wanted to go to singapore so badly that i would actually take a cheap flight to berlin and then do this i do not live in the united states so low cost is very easy to get to berlin  flew sq325 fra sin on 23 02 23 water was served from pitchers not bottles when dinner was served i asked for a beer and was told that they have run out of bier sgddollar600mil profit in the last quarter and all the cost cutting no bier now we know why we are no longer 1 may as well just scoot  the silence seat is worth every penny  bro did for us  never put your feet on any long haul budget airline it will make you feel miserable  i took scoot on a fifth freedom flight from berlin to athens one year ago which obviously was not such a bad experience compared to the other options you have on this route but i seriously can not imagine to be onboard their boeing 787 for 13 hours so thanks that you sacrificed yourself for me   indigo offers much better meals i rather have their sandwiches than scoots meal  back in february 2020 just before covid hit my parents and i were on vacation in indonesia we were checking flight offers from berlin still txl back then to denpasar and were actually considering scoot for a moment i watched a trip report on their 787 too i think it might have even been on this channel we decided against it eventually especially because my mom would not agree to spending 12 hours without entertainment when we finally went to indonesia again over christmas 2022 almost 3 years later we still decided for full service airlines instead it is worth the extra money to us xd the longest low cost flight i had so far was on easyjet from berlin ber to sharm el sheik in egypt around 4 hours of flight time time the return flight obviously yea that was painful enough i think the longest i would agree to would be 6 hours anything more than 3 hours on an lcc is a big no for me  i would go absolutely mad being on a flight that long with no in flight entertainment  thanks david for this report i would have to be in a desperate situation to fly scoot or any similar cheapie airline on long haul short haul would be ok but that is it for me i rather pay money and have a pleasant experience  seems better than us economy flights decend not approach on december 2022 i have ever tried flying scoot 787 8 9v ofe from osaka kansai to singapore changi for 7 hours and i even sat at the same seat as you 33k sadly it is a different plane but the flight did not feel good i was so bored during the flight and thirsty as well  im totally convinced that people that choose this airline knowingly just hate themselves i would not even get on a scoot longhaul flight even if you paid me so thanks for your sacrifice  maximum 4 hours especially not on scoot you advised passengers to bring their own food and drink does scoot allow that now in other reviews i saw it was said that scoot had a strict policy of forbidding the carrying and consumption of any outside food and drink with angry crew confiscating the product and if they saw it before takeoff even threatening to expel the passenger from the plane  never  very nice low price  man that kinda suck can you make a brutally honest on norse or your turkish airlines buisness class on their a350 900 from istanbul johanseberg  you took one for the team  i would consider myself as a price conscious traveler but i think low cost on a long haul flight is something i would not be willing to do thanks for providing this excellent honest review i have flown scoot before to and fro langkawi da nang hanoi and bangkok on their 787 all pretty short hops they were pretty bearable it got us from point a to b without much fuss however beware of delays like one i experienced on the return leg from bangkok i have heard of some that can get as long as a day or even cancelled scoot is mainly infamous for its delays i have been lucky enough not to experience that long of a delay only a couple hours wait all in all if you have got enough entertainment and food fly scoot if there is no other option however if there are other options such as air asia anywhere within asean not air asia x or zipair 3 times a week flights to narita fly those instead i seriously can not bear 10 13 hours on a scoot flight let alone it being delayed  i am sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk  i am sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk  i can not imagine flying on that holy  if i fly 14 hrs on emirates a380 and its still tiring af imagine on a scoot 0 0 i used to fly scoot biz from melbourne to singapore pre covid it was comfortable and a good price have not flown them since scoot is probably the worst airline i have ever been in pathetic seats on the 787 that lack any lumbar support or headrest and the arrogant staff  scoot is website says that you are not allowed to bring your own food and drinks on board i will give this poor excuse for an airline a wide berth take an alternative route if the price is right i would fly with scoot i would definitely consider upgrading to that scoot in silence cabin extra legroom seats private cabin and like david mentioned adjustable headrests the one on the 787 8 is particularly good i am waiting for an opportunity to try it myself the ground service is where the airline falls down on bad days so that is one thing to consider too  imo good food keeps people happy the very least that scoot can do is improve the catering because just by looking at it i lost all appetite lol someome said it airasia meal better scoot mean my food fair better than sg  air asia was first based in malaysia it explains the better food and its current hub is indonesia which also has great food gt nah just kidding singapore airlines has pretty great food  amazing content david must have been exhilarating to be landing in a thunderstorm  nice bro maximum 4 hrs are my limit on low cost airlines  my longest flight with a low cost carrier was with norwegian between copenhagen and los angeles as long as you know it is taking 11 hours you brought your own food purchased at the airport which is better than the one served or purchased on board you have your ipad with movies and a book a similar experience than with a regular airline in economy especially after the pandemic where many perks are axed  nasi lemak is from malaysia not singapore lets go im early again super video david   this is the sad and bad part of singapore airlines that they do not hope we see scoot is owned by parent company singapore airlines singapore airlines sia is such a good airline but its sad to see them do such money grabbing things like power plug charges and bottled water prices being so high on sia power and water is free if sia made power free and water way cheaper that would really make the whole singapore airlines corporation truly a great way to fly for now it seems that they are pouring everything they have into sia which is not bad either but a little attention to the budget side of sia will do it some good i personally have never flown scoot i can not handle without ife soryyyyyy i almost always fly singapore but i would not mind trying them on short hops to places like malaysia in the future lastly thx for ur review d love from singapore p i have never seen any airline that charges you to use a power outlet that is outrageous i am planning on living in australia for university next year so as i am from europe i guess i will need to book a scoot flight   0 00 let the 12h torture begin i have flown scoot from singapore to gold coast and that was a interesting experience  dude literally sacrificed 13 hours for the bros please review about cambodia angkor air  5 6 hrs flying with them in april and doing sydney to singapore and i am looking forward to seeing what it is like ah yes thanks for reviewing scoot as i plan to fly with them on my trip to australia those fees for water and power outlet are indeed outrageous i would rather fly with cebu pacific if i have the luxury of time which they do not provide as they are notorious for being the least punctual airline in manila  i love you david simply aviation i am actually so glad that you guys did a brutally honest episode on scoot as a not so rich singaporean i frequently fly on scoot to visit my family in china since they were the only airline that operated direct flights to those cities in china which basically means i frequently fly 8 5 hours on their 787 and 5 5 hours on their a320 which is very painful it is definitely not ideal but its like the only thing i can afford  water bottles should be complimentary how did you survive such a long flight without any form of in flight entertainment haha great video as always  that is what we call taking one for the team sacrificing yourself for twelve hours in ultra low cost long haul so we the subscribers do not have to you have achieved boss status  i flew scoot from berlin to athens last year good enough for the 3 hours but i do not think i would want to fly the entire way to singapore with them was not the flight terribly boring despite the inflight wifi and will the philippine airlines mnl jfk video be a trip report or a brutally honest video i would favor tripreport  as always very good video  scood is in polite  and mum is fried rice  my mom does not cook fried rice but pasta  damn i would save more then would never fly an ultra long haul on scoot  i have flown scoot from sydney to singapore in the fly in silence cabin the food was pretty dire and on our flight we were not allowed to take one is own food on board however having said that for the price we paid it was good value and i would do it again  they charge for power outlets  actually i don t really need ife or food for 12h i can use my tablet computer to entertain myself and bring a few snacks with me to keep me from starving my major issue with scoot is about the legroom being 190cm tall there is no way to stay on this plane for longhaul what i really love is the silence area every airline should introduce an area where no small children or drunk douchebags are allowed  my condolences   7 13 actually scoot will ban you for bringing outside food and drink which is a really disgusting rule  i would go crazy this gives me flashbacks to air canada rouge nice trip report david looking forward for this  scoot is one of the best lccs around it could rival some full service airlines in some countries   i loved tegel airport said no berlin resident ever i have been in one of scoot is business class flights from singapore to hangzhou a couple of years ago the service was good but to my surprise there was no usb port on the seat while the ac power outlet was offered so i had to plug in my laptop and then charge my phone with it  is there the tripreport for this  i the boeing 787 longest was on air asia around 9h i think kul melbourne nice nice video no comments ima fix that how tf does every airline have the exact same 787 9 making video  even in the us make sure to fly scoot it service every where  can you release the original version of

 is it reupload  hey why do not you follow me on  as well see you over there  flew with scoot from mel sin ath return mid 2017 and loved it it was my first international solo trip and the airfares cost me dollar900 including a checked bag and seats and i could not fault any of the segments the aircrafts were clean and each flight departed and arrived on time i have not had the chance to fly them again but will when airfare prices normalise  so you can take a backpack without paying for it more right  but u do not mind how cheap it is right do not complain if you want champagne then pay for it otherwise you get soda water ive been on scoot 8 times and its never failes to be a success really speaking apart from the seats which i get a blow up cushion and turn it into first class the rest is the same plane as sq or qantas  dear josh cohill it is very enjoyable beautiful interesting video of scooty airlines love regards  one time scoot but never ever again have travel europe south east asia ten year so have some experience why scoot do everything to make it worst than they need for that cost they at least can try but they failed we will see for how long they last even air asia cebu pacific do it 100 times better but on the long haul flight to eu i choose a premium flight company  think you just saved me a lot of unnecessary headaches was considering scoot as it is around dollar350aud syd to manila as opposed to around dollar700 for qantas after watching this i think i am just gonna pay the extra haha  the rolls royce trent 1000 engines on this plane are awful too great video but i beg to differ for full service airlines i have higher standards for scoot as a budget airline it is fine i flew an a319 from hong kong to singapore on scoot after the tiger merger and even that was adequate as i already ate in the terminal anyway the seats on the 787 in regular economy were just fine  please take jetair you will know austrilia buget airline is more suck scoot sucks big time flew them once and will never repeat that hopefully dirty cabin filthy floor and when asking for a cup of water for medicine was told i can buy a bottle spent the best part of the first hour arguing and waiting for that cup until they eventually delivered it luggage measurements and weights are also anally enforced even it was exactly 400g over the cabin limit 120 usd extra come off it  what music was that in the intro  this is why scoot has the world is worst b787 dreamliner because it is a budget airline avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  love you to bits  josh xx dude i always fly on scoot i flew scoot gold coast to singapore 13hr stopover and then 11hrs to athens it was pretty uncomfortable but cheap they did not have the padded head rests too  with jetstar i can not choose my seat without paying either i also spent a bunch of hours on the athens airport due to an early morning flight it was because of my flight from athens paris layover to get from paris to la got cancelled and was rescheduled 2 days after and since uber was not a thing and i did not had cash anymore my wife and i decided to be at the airport since the night before it was like 10 hours i was torture i mean you can not pick your seat paying basic economy i just flew delta klm aegean austrian and lufthansa last march and i could not choose without paying extra ynwa  nooooo what did you call scoot  u flew a llc tf were u expecting a red carpet and all first class lie down seats  they lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate i curse them immidiate bankrupt thanks for your review this prompted me to look for alternatives thanks for your review it has made me decide to look for alternatives   10 45 well i booked a flight from berlin singapore  hope i am gonna survive it   who is worse scoot or spirit  looking at flights with scoot from perth australia to athens 22 hour flight  not worth it i assume  it is the worst long haul airline on the planet  i had a misconnection with singapore airlines budget carrier scoot last month due to delay no big deal but when i asked for a confirmation letter from scoot for my insurance claim they refused to give it even when the governing laws i am flying from malaysia by the malaysian government that they are legally required to provide letter within 7 days if the flight delayed more than 30 minutes my flight that caused the misconnection was delayed for 2 hours until now they still refuse to provide me with the misconnection letter god just a confirmation letter for misconnection there is no monetary liability for them yet they refuse to provide do not fly scoot or even singapore airlines period  it took 3 hours for us to get a water on scoot try also myairlines scoot airline food is good but other things suck i am a small person so the cabin size really does not bother me my tips is bring cash card otherwise you will be thirsty but overall i think my experience with scoot is good you get what you get pay cabin crews are all polite to me  asian version of spirit and frontier airlines in the us  do not fly scoot flew with them on 21 december 2022 from bangkok to singapore i paid for extra leg room seats for myself and 12 year old son in the middle row of their b787 dreamliner after settling in the flight attendant requested that we both move to a window seat near the exit because a singapore family needed our seats i stated to the attendant that my son was only 12 years old and that seemed like no problem once seated in the new seats we were then approached by the senior attendant who looked at my son and said you can not sit in this seat because you are under 18 years of age i complained and asked if he could be moved to business class in compensation the response was that is impossible you can contact scoot for a refund now i know this was not going to happen as the attendant offered no proof of the switch i am confused why my australian child sitting in their correct seat had to swap seats with a singapore child my son was forced to sit in a cramped row behind his original seat next time i fly i will pay more to keep my blood pressure in order  do not know why over rated singapore air merged with known horrible obnoxious scoot that served jail food and focuses more on selling duty free goods  instead of charging customer ridiculous price on the refreshments ended up no one buying them why would not airliners charge them at reasonable cost with more customers buying them  my suitcase was lost on the scooter 5 months ago until now no news called emailed no answer i have put it in consumer media and reported it to the ministry of transportation because scoot seems to be out of control and my brother said that scoot is better than singapore great review just wondering if your flight was at 0700 why did you get there so early why not get up early at the hotel and then head in  bro your soundtrack on this flight sounded like spyros the dragons soundtrack lol can you charge your phone and would also like to know if the front row seats seats without seats directly in front of them include tray tables thanks sydney to singapore on scoot costs dollar303 00 au sydney to singapore on qantas costs dollar679 00 au you get what you pay for  fun fact they sell single trip economy ticket to china at 4k sgd in sept 2022 in its normal eonomy class sit is the student offer valid on scoot airline if the the other half of my journey is with singapore airline  i think you are wrong about the chair not reclining there is a grey button on the side of the arms rest which gives u a few cms of recline great videos love watching them josh you are a legend old chap  still better than ryanair the absolute biggest issue with scoot is that they force you to take off sleeping mask and any headphones during start and landing 30 minutes before landing so a possible 4h sleep quickly becomes 2h which is awful in the video it shows you did managed to recline the seat it is normal in any airlines that the last row can not recline thus makes the reporting inaccurate it is like 1 hour haha my wife and i picked up return flights from sydney to vietnam for dollar501 each saved at least dollar900 compared to another airline we were going to fly on yeah 8 hours or so from sydney to singapore not a big deal take your own blanket snacks travel pillow and entertainment 13 hour lay over in changi changi is a mini holiday resort and then another 3 1 2 hours to hanoi its like ryan air for asia we travel light no check in baggage for the price it is pretty awesome as long as i get there on time and do not end up at the bottom of the sea i would not consider if for a long haul though  nice informative video sir i have question is it allow trustiest visa to go out from singapore airport  with the money you save you can buy food and a ipad to take with you  flew scoot in late 2017 singapore to manila my baggage check in baggage was overweight i was willing to pay for extra baggage allowance but the ground staff was so nice and friendly and suggested that i put some in my hand carry bag instead to avoid paying extra that is excellent customer service and i still remember it up to this day  i flew scoot from sydney to singapore nice clean efficient plane baggage allowance was good but that is it so you take a book or an ipad or try to sleep i could even put up with their over priced food but the problem is the food is terrible if they are going to rip you off for the food they could at least serve something decent apparently scoot is known for their awful food  scoot is a great airline for price do not expect much from a budget airlines lovely airlines but but but a lot of buts  save i booked a flight and did not see the second leg was scoot l booking with singapore but the second leg was with scoot not happy the ground staff in scoot airlines is very bad  they did not ask that we are transit from dubai and also have a formal email that we are transferred from one airline to another   i flew scoot from singapore to kuching and vice versa i am impressed with the service reliability and price  badddd baggages of mine and my friends from wherever the country is got stuck in singapore the baggages are not extended automatically to the destination countries we re disappointed and reporting to customer care is useless no reply scoot are what they are you know up front what you get for your dollars its a budget airline ffs  i have flown scoot on several occasions now more recently from perth to singapore with a connector to penang last week i was able to select my seat but pay for it i selected seat 44a which did recline and the extra space next to me was great i arrived in singapore 12am with the next flight departing 9am so i feel your pain to ease things i booked into the plaza lounge sdollar80 which was over priced over crowded the food was terrible bar closed and i could not sleep as one guy was snoring keeping everyone else awake at least he got some sleep the only good thing was the shower which was well worth the wait definitely not worth the money not sure if it is due to covid i personally do not think so but the overall scoot service and onboard catering is terrible in addition my booking was duplicated due to a processing glitch and was told by the cs agent that i would incur a sdollar50 fee for a refund common sense prevailed after a vigorous discussion and getting her to check with a supervisor i was advised a fee would not be charged but the refund would take 6 8 weeks i still have another month to wait for a refund also i had to send an email to cancel the duplicated booking a week after they told me it was cancelled still no written response to my email totally disappointed with their overall performance it seems to have really gone downhill  not a great way to start a relaxing holiday  i had no problem with flying scoot i got what i paid for amp they delivered the dreamliner is modern amp i paid a little more to choose my seat in the quiet section i met a married couple amp we drank and forgot we were in the quiet section  amp were asked to quiet down which was a bit embarrassing for me i am not usually the noisy passenger but we were enjoying ourselves i would fly them again i have flown them 4 times  i have had several scoot flights all of them were great value e g singapore berlin direct flight for 158euros back in 2018 our seats has always been assigned together regarding the food it is always expensive in the airplanes simply bring your own food by now they do have board entertainment which you can access with your phone flying with a low cost airline with having so many expectations is ridiculous really it is most bad airline fucking airline i flew with scoot earlier this year i have no complaints for a budget airline try one of the others and you will stop complaining  i helped my colleagues claim lost baggages when they flew with scoot twice  scoot is called a budget airline for a reason lol world bad assssss scoot my foot i lost my mony 60 k in march 2022 poorest service never book your flight on scoot flied scoot many years ago with my kids booked online and was checking out to make payment when prompted to add on inflight entertainment using own devices accepted add on then complete the payment once on plane inflight did not work staff then showed list of compatible devices felt cheated asked for refund negative asked to replace with food negative only given a email address to write in wrote in help desk from philippines called complained that during booking not highlighted about list of compatible devices help desk could not do anything lesson learnt marketing not connected with operation  scoot is a low cost airline and they do a great job but you seem to be expecting the services of a full service airline at the price of a budget airline that is a little ridiculous best airport to spend a night at love it when you said scoot get your shit together great video as always josh  just booked a flight from bangkok to perth at dollar370 it was less than half the price thaiairways charge at dollar800 also thaiairways do not offer a flight to perth now thaiairways owe me dollar1000 after they cancelled my flight in 2020 because of covide they will not give me a refund just a dollar2000 option to fly to sydney they can fuck off subscribed  my best lowcost flight was a gulf air hkk to bkk leg and i got laid by the czech cabin girl that night we arranged to meet as they had a lay over lol excuse the pun  you are really milking it to all the viewers feel free to skip the first 7 minutes that meal they served me was the worse airline meal i ever ate and i have been traveling for 20yrs  it is a bus  scoot is like wormhole for me i board sleep and arrive sleeping helps me skip all the bad bits lol  liverpool fan   4 42 can we appreciate that he put a camera inside a trash bin  is scoot airlines still fying in the present times  another reviewer flew scoot business class and the food was terrible so you had a lucky escape there and while he lobed up at business check in so did the economy passengers and thus was allowed so he got no concessions for flying business class  not for money and good words with this strange low cost airline  one time in scoot from singapore to bangkok they did not mention the flight the tr before flight number so we went to immigration and showed our ticket they were not allowing we stayed and finding the scoot office in the airport but we did not find it but a nice lady in the airport understood and because of her we called go into bangkok its was the worst experience ever this story is not the main bangkok airport it is a another airport for low cost airline unethical company and terrible service they made me pay for everything they did not validate my documents beforehand and he did not let me arbitrarily board my flight i am a chilean and croatian citizen but i was living in vietnam for approximately 9 months i bought a ticket to greece from vietnam on scoot airlines but they did not let me fly since i did not have a croatian passport later on the same airline i wanted to buy a ticket to go to germany but they did not let me for the same reasons finally without a croatian passport i flew through emirates airlines without problems since i did have a croatian citizenship document that scoot airlines did not accept despite the fact that the regulations clearly in both mentioned countries said that they accepted the entry of croatian citizens they did not validate my documents nor did they bother to find out if the citizen documents would be accepted in the destination country  complaining that choosing seat is dollar11 food is dollar12 etc but do you not realise that singapore airlines etc will charge hundreds more low cost airlines are giving you the choice to add those things or not rather than being forced to pay more for them  there was once i took scoot from singapore to thailand my family got the seats at the back and we were able to sit all apart to look at the view  was told by a local singaporean recently never to fly scoot i believe these locals who have nothing to loose by passing on their knowledge that airport is amazing i would spend all day there even if i was not flying anywhere  did you notice the formula 1 things for the singapore gp where sebastian vettel won air asia is the low cost king  i can buy 9 cup of noodles in the us for the price of 1 on that flight so just bring your own noodles amp a mre heater bag amp your set lol  bro scoot is the best budget airline i flew that airline every year when we go to cebu to singapore then going back i flew scootbiz when they were fairly new back in 2012 from singapore to gold coast for sgd 550 the staff were great and i think wearing the same uniforms but it was impossible to sleep even with earplugs as everything was so rickety squeaky i think it was an ex sia a340 or 777 i would not do it again unless i have no alternatives  so i took them once from melbourne to jaipur except that a month out from the flight i got an email saying that my ticket was cancelled from singapore to jaipur because they no longer were serving that route the options were a reroute or refund of that leg which would take 12 weeks i think it was i am not sure why airlines take that long to refund your money possibly they hope you will choose a different option in the end i just flew to kl from singapore and took air asia to jaipur the process of the reroute took hours and hours on the phone trying to work it out and just as long waiting for the call to be answered i did still fly scoot to singapore though on the dreamliner in what they called iscootbiz at the time it was a large seat and meals were included although i already had paid for the meal i big dollar150 to upgrade which was the lowest they allowed and i was surprised to find i won the seat but i slept and it was comfortable the cabin crew were not that friendly i remember that air asia for all its faults i like in as much as the staff are usually super friendly and welcoming the same could not be said for scoot i feel like they staffed it by demoting staff who didnt hit kpis on singapore airlines and were not happy about it great vid as always josh  at oeats scoot is better than some ungrateful creep if u are on my flight and you are tge obly passenger ill eject myself and leave you to crash to the ground you deserve it idc if hav typo read it yourself singapore scoot is better than some traahy american airlines  here is a soft reminder for changi airport  no offense this is told by my singaporean friends changi hv swimming pools and there are no security guard at the night time probably they sneak out so u might not need to pay for this charged facility and get a shower there quick question why do you always prefer to sit at the very back  singapore to bali i think the best is still klm in terms of price and come with full service  not being able to recline the seat is good as then the person in front can not recline into you  it was like dollar10us for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice that is not a bad price at all for a meal in the sky  i have use scoot and air asia quite a lot usually because of budget constraints the staff are pretty good and they smile a lot too actually for food u can order online when you book the flights it is slightly cheaper than when you are on the flight  ah pre covidian days josh scoot closed captioning screwed  i miss changi hopefully corona soon finish so all airports in the world will be free open soon when you bay a seat you not get a benz  but a budget airline and they buy a 787 dreamliner that does not make sense as it does not matched scoots cheated me lied to me your staff harassed me nisha sharma ms emma then ms nicole ang then ms daisy fssw scoot we charge sdollar11 for seat selection american airlines hold my coffee we charge dollar60 or more for seat selection free seat selection if booking with checked bags worst part is scoot bans you from bringing your own food what  singapore is a wonderful place but the singaporean people do not take criticism well as they hold a belief that the are superior to asian nations  i flew from berlin to singapore on scoot it was josh is experience on steroids never gonna try to be cheap again  i flew scoot in business class back in 2018 it was an okay flight now screen so i was happy i had my big ipad with me tho when on board it was really cold and travelling from one warm country to another i did not bring a jacket with me into the plane from singapore to japan and i was freezing so bad for 5 hours the flight crew could only help me with a cup of warm water which helped a bit but the plane being icy cold that was really bad of them not to have blankets especially for business class the food was averrage so no complaints the only think was the heating otherwise nice crew and really nice view i do not hate on them at all just think they should have blankets on board for long flights that are over 6 hours  lol i remember falling asleep next to the scoot checking counter when i was transiting from changi to bangkok during debarkation the carpet looked disgusting ive been flying scoot for about 5 years now except 2020 i always thought in flight food and water was more of a priviledge rather than an essential i frequent the sin to tsn and back how is silk air  last year i flew to singapore from chennai  its an average airline though i give 5 to all the airlines for safe travel  i took scoot from singapore to taiwan about 5 hours the experience was not so bad at least the seat was quite comfortable better than other budget flight so service is good service to me the air crews leave me alone in the entire journey proper friendly was not included how nice  comn scoot is the worst of the lot do not waste your time and money with them hope you did not get a death threat from scoot for your review  hmmm book the cheapest flight and expect first class service wake up to the real world  if you have ever been with scoot you have loved the singapore airport because it is a magical place there did he say low class carrier  man love the videos i have the same reebok shoes which you are wearing  the seats in scoot o m g  my experience with scoot i booked a flight from clark to zurich for may 18 2020 this flight got canceled due to covic 19 i took the voucher since i need to fly to europe anyway i try to book the exact same flight for september october always get an error that they wont accept the voucher for the flight it took almost a month until scoot notified me that i can not use this voucher same flight as voucher is originated from for this flight since it is partly with singapore airlines parent company this was not announced or in any of scoot is rules when i decided to go for the voucher my request to then refund the voucher back to my credit card was denied vouchers can not be refunded and will expire within a year this is more than cheat on costumers not talking about customer company relationship and this with a parent company singapore airlines both never ever again what do you think  josh please make a video on silk air  we used scoot to fly from melbourne to athens and we had sandwiches croissants cakes and many more with us also we had 5 bottles of water everything in our cabin luggage and no crew member said anything also we used out tablet instead the in flight entertainment we paid dollar1550 in total for 2 return tickets with 40kg total baggage and 6h stop at singapore second cheapest was emirates with dollar1600 each ticket if anyone want to pay dollar1600 more just to have meal and tv well that is not me  good  4 41 why did you throw away ur camera funny indian sitting in front of your seat  did you hear him speaking in a funny tone during travel  been flying scoot for 10 years  awesome airline real travellers know if you got more than 6 hrs in changi airport jump on mrt into town for a few hours scoot worse airline ever total robbing bzztds utter crap shit airline no customer service i could go on and on and do not bother commenting back to me about being cheap i have paid full freight on this airline still shit not even a bottle of water yea wait till they cancel a flight 6 hours before take off then give you a dollar500 credit for a dollar780 flight then you pay dollar2500 on another airline stay away from scoot my brother lives in singapore he is used to fly scoot  worst airline in the world changed our flight with no notification spent over 20 hours with a mobile and home phone trying to get in contact with someone to no avail they may be cheap but they are also nasty will never fly with them again  once flyscoot took your money there would be no refund unless someone met with mishap terrible airline and the horrible ceo  scoot is a good enough sevice i found scoot is business class to be atrocious as well  we had a scoot flight as part of a ticket with singapore airlines heathrow to clark philippines staff were really friendly and we had a meal and drink included as part of our ticket drink was coke or water thats it and the meal was terrible i had vegan meals on singapore and asked the crew if my meal was vegan and they just shrugged it was a really bad attempt at a microwave meal had one spoonful on the way home just said no thank you thank god this was only a three hour flight might just be coming from singapore airlines to scoot was so different but i do not think i would fly them again or singapore for that matter on this route if they use them i hv to admit that scoot has the widest seat space in budget airlines  low cost does not mean have to be low in hospitality n manners  passengers still pay n it is not like free flight  experienced those moments  great information i am very cautious with budget airlines thank you so much for the video  when i asked for water in scoot in jan2020 they asked me to buy a water bottle for 2 dollars  although through extreme persuation they gave me water they use for the noodles and coffee  now you know singapore suck if they charge low price that is why singapore tax too damm high stop complaining it is basic but the plane is very unlikely to fall for the price you pay  worth it when i paid sgd 580 for jakarta singapore berlin return also personally i find scoot is food a lot better than many other budget airlines eg air asia jetstar so the price is justified  scoot is a much safer airline compared to others in sea would prioritise that over other perks hey josh how much u paid for the flight  i am not a fan of scoot i do not like their policy of outside food is not allowed on flight plus their food is expensive kind of force me spent unreasonable price for the food on flight sometimes the ticket is not the cheap as well airasia still offer cheaper ticket most of the time and the food are more affordable for the seat selection i think almost all airlines no matter budget or non budget most require you to pay for seat selection this is budget airline you can not blame them for this  what a dreamliner i always fly with scoot when i had a chance for holiday trip yess they are cheap airline but i rather choose scoot than cebupac airline scoot is more better they are on time than cebupac airline cheap but always delay  i do not understand scoot is great air asia is superior and normally cheaper great meals at a reasonable price kl is also a cheaper nicer city to sightsee in  i totally agreed as this airline is totally overprice unless you have no other choice do not choose this airline  airasia is better damn i thought that the scoot logo in the thumbnail is an egg only time i would fly with scoot or budget airlines is to go to nearby countries like bangkok malaysia and others  singaporean here hey fly scoot is not worst the food price is higher than airasia trust me i prefer scoot than turkish airlines first of all scoot has bigger seats even though turkish has tvs they are horrible scoot actually has good edible food scoot is much cheaper turkish airline is seats are sooo tight and they are so uncomfortable the end scoot hnl to changing was disgusting seats stained and uncleaned toilet had dirty wet floor no toilet paper or paper towels had to pay for any checked baggage seats very cramped had to pay for a blanket or pillow food lousy and expensive small btl of water dollar4us i must add flight attendants very nice  2 hrs 45 mins head rest looks v comfy fare is the thanks for vlog it is a budget low cost airlines do not compare to full fare airlines please be fair in your review  mate you are the only youtuber that only seems to have negative experiences you expect 5 star singapore airlines style service on their budget carrier scoot is cheap for a reason and dollar11 for seat selection is very reasonable for a lcc  i probably fly as much as you but my experiences seem totally different i see more negatives from your videos than any other airline commentator high standards or an entitled view of the world if i was an airline i would be a bit nervous if i knew you were flying with us think i would rather have one world flyer or dennis bunnick on board living in australia i fly scoot quite a lot to pick up european flights in asia in my experience they are cheaper more comfortable and definitely more reliable than either air asia or jetstar food is not as good as air asia but as good as jetstar so they are my preferred budget airline for my 7 9 hour trips pulcra sunt quae visa placent  i hv travelled in scoot its very good  4 43 seriously you put camera in dustbin for your fantasy direction hahahaha  scoot is a budget airline bruh they gave me free peanuts the best aeroplane food one question is the economy class seat has a power outlet  next year will be flying with scoot to berlin  oh one more thing is it okay to bring your won food to the plane is anyone has experienced  would love to hear   headrests only in some of the economy seats how odd  4 41 no one josh shoves camera down a bin have you try airasia what is your comments  i am going to fly from singapore to berlin in april and i do not really care for anything special because i paid 180euros for my ticket so what would i expect if i want to eat 3 meals drink 4 beverages and book a seat it will still be cheaper than flying singapore airlines it is like spirit airlines charge for everything geez  josh as long as you do the booking together you and your friend can sit together  josh there is a option to choose your seat while booking the ticket itself the most important fact is safety n on time the rest not an issue fr me i hv very bad experience with scoot departing time fm noon delay till 10pm i miss my evening gathering arrive bangkok 11 pm just to zzz ok blame me fr selecting scoot blame myself fr flying on actual day of event  agreed scoot is a really shitty airlines air asia is way better can i check how tall are you  josh is accent is irish is he  when i travel long distance on a budget airline i bring my own food sandwich fruit nuts etc never been refused a free glass of water with any airline when i have asked  scoot is ok for the price liverpool fc you legend  scoot was alright actually when we went to thailand and yeah i agree with the time slots singapore to berlin is 13 hours and i am on that flight on tuesday already a bit worried that is gonna be very tough  scoot cancelled my morning flight from dps to singapore took 12 hrs standing around the terminal enduring their chaotic organisational ability and dire communication and service to get sorted onto another flight then they lost my luggage took 6 days to get it back to me never again  singapore is not a good airport to spend the night not enough comfy spaces to sleep  as much as i love my country and singapore airlines i will never ever fly scoot becos as u clearly seen for yourself unless i have no choice it is the worst of any lcc i have seen the 787 is just that a 787 with nothing and service is no where to be seen the food is exp and horrible and scoot stands for sure cannot operate on time haha it is a disgrace to our national carrier the parent company i understand it is lcc but airasia and jetstar just to name 2 are so much better and as i always tell my friends do your homework plan ahead and many times i get great value on legendary carriers such as eva as tg etc there is no need to fly anywhere above 2 hrs in scoot it is a disgrace  the title worst is rather misleading i have flown on scoot numerous times between singapore and various australian cities for the price it is quite hard to beat have flown singapore to sydney return for lt sdollar300 fly only no bag before i think your expectations are at the wrong level which will obviously lead to disappointment  hey josh i am from nepal and i was wandering if you make a video about travelling to lukla airport one of the dangerous in a mini plane and 25 min flight from kathmandu to beautiful pokhara which is my city by the way  try jetstar value air and you will think your on candid camera the knee room is nonexistent and the food not edible wow we are rivals i am arsenal fan please try dragon air hong kong to beijing  jet star is the best low cost airline indigo at least gives water without charge   this company gives me a ticket from singapore to sydney for dollar200 i am not complaining man try pegasus airasia was ranked 20th for best airlines 2019 skytrax  in there with all the big guns like qatar sia ana etc so yeah airasia would definitely outclass the other budget airlines the food on airasia is fantastic and they really paid attention to the quality nasi lemak nasi briyani even their snacks like curry puffs are simply delicious and they are cheap when u get them online during your booking even shopping for items are great got myself an rfid compact card cash holder on one of their flights for a reasonable price the flight timings are also quite decent although i do remember those early days when they first started flying times were really awful like way too late at night or too early in the morning now since the fleet has expanded tremendously they do have a better selection of flight times for long hauls they even offer flat beds great huh air asia is still the best lcc in asia aa food is delicious and unbeatable  i have flown scoot once though in their scootbiz cabin seat was good for the price but the meal included and the same as is offered for sale in the rest of the plane was borderline inedible i would not pay for one if it was an option  flying from sin to bali use garuda or klm those are the best  whenever i see your video the has something bad about the flight or the country i have always enjoyed watching your reviews very constructive and honest  then you said you like watching liverpool fc that justput you to the very top of my favourite travel vlogger hands up ynwa  what do you think about boeing 787 batteries i heard there is an issue on the battery is it fixed now already  it is a lcc what do u guys expect if you expect more than this please pay more than this you can fly with sq tho they have everything next time if you fly with scoot and u know u gonna be thirsty gonna be hungry please pre order some meal it save abit of ur money sure u can sit with ur friends during the flight just kindly request from the checkin staff i am sure they are more than happy to help  airasia is the best budget airline is southeast asia the meals are less than dollar5 each which i find more delicious than meals in garuda the staffs are helpful  want to see worse imagine moulds on the ac vents u get 100 ml free water only stained seats try nookscoot the staff is really nice tho love all your videos very interesting nice a fellow lfc fan hopefully this year we go 1 rank better  i was surprised that you sort of enjoyed them i see sooo many horror reviews of scoot d try wizz air and after that you will absolutely love scoot 6 hrs from astana nur sultan to budapest on wizz was an absolute pain  i think you shouldnt be an airline reviewer scoot is one of the best if not the best lcc you are comparing apples with oranges its an lcc for goodness sake lol you ask for much when what you pay for your ticket is peanuts you might as well also add that business class of an fsc is way better than scoot lol what you should actually focus on is the value for money is it worth saving that money to fly on an lcc rather than in economy class of a fsc  their bulky back of seat intimidating next seat uncomfort  why not let your viewers on your blogs know what you are paid for that ticket whether it was free discounted or normal fee economy premium economy business and first class on your reviews that may assist with people is choices when flying  all seats at the rear bulkhead can not recline this is normal even on a full service airline  scoot 787 very warm inside cabin  try air india express once josh i am really enjoying your content recently josh keep up the good work  seats no one is sitting on us we feel useless josh proceeds to sit on the floor seats why are we still here just to suffer im thinking of flying to berlin tegel with scoot next year  lcc scoot singapore lt lt airasia malaysia fsc malaysia airlines lt lt singapore airlines josh i love you and your vids but i think you are forgetting that precious ba charges both for food and seat selection and i think you should try the long haul to berlin or athens that they fly and review their premium class compare it then to norwegian is low cost long haul  hi josh air asia is the total package great crews great fares vegetarian food that puts some mainline carriers like sq to shame not targetting singapore airlines but when booking their flights to athens berlin et al beware these sq flights are operated by scoot bad form esp if paying sq fare qantas does the same opaque marketing of flights meaning you could end up on jetstar a case of once bitten twice shy  in paul lucas review he mentions that not only is food expensive onboard they ban you from bringing your own food and drink on board is that still true that would be a deal breaker for me lcc or not lcc  if u travel with friends or family on scoot actually do not have to pay dollar11 for the seats it will be automatically assigned together as long as all of them are checked in together it happens to me quite a number of times  what i don t agree with is you book a flight aircraft get s delay 24 hours yet they paying for your motel or hotel even know you only pay for your seat on a aircraft if you get a bus it gets delay 24 hours they wont put you up in motel hotel they laugh at you why is people book a flight it gets delay and expect motels hotel even know your paying for a aircraft seat  yeah low cost but if you add the extras nothing special airasia the best among other low cost you may review citilink good feedback about them scoot  in my taste pass  rather fly sq mi to dps  which is more or less quite similar in price if booked early  josh you are the best love you man  1 54 do not use a vpn on social media because it might get your account banned  no map on the flight i have flown old airbus that has a map at least of the flight i can not believe dreamliners are made like this no screens on the seat and no charge outlet almost had a panic attack i was like what the hell to do low cost does not mean we should not have tech onboard i can spend days at changi its the best airport i have ever seen the best part is a free movie theatre and a free sleeping lounge you have should have gone to one of the lounges  there is no tiger bro bear in mind its a budget carrier expect according to what you paid  never heard of someone trying to be intentionally tired when flying on planes but you do you bro  omg the time lapse at the beginning looks so amazing how long did it take to shoot this scene and which camera do you use  always liked your content and honest reviews and now from this video we know you are also a fan of liverpool fc you now have been upgraded to one of the top channel for me  y n w a scoot is service is fine but from my personal experience the management is a problem i flown from singapore to thailand and the flight postponed 2 hours and it got delayed for another 2 hours  is scoot the airline that does not allow you to bring your own snacks on board as well or is that a different airline  i flu scoot from bali to singapore business class its not that bad i mean its worst compare to full service airlines like emirates but at least their safety has good standard of developed nation airlines the service just like any order budget airlines like air asia  you should be careful about what you say i have travelled with scoot as well and it is a good airline you said that the seats were comfortable and the crew was good you have great expectations from a budget airline need some extra comfort kindly pay for it  so funny i got a sccot add wile watching your amount on ads in videos are just sad not good product  well done josh so brown bag food to save money ynwa  oh my gosh you actually spent a night at the airport to simulate a tired traveller amazing love your dedication josh  fly scoot a few times honestly never have issue but of course am not as cheapskate as i paid for better seat food and luggage and the total cost is still half price the premium airlines of course as llc i do tone down my ego expectation  they are not even cheap but forbid to bring food flew them last year from sin klu and back felt cramped but flights were on time good slots and for less than 1h absolutely acceptable would fly them again i had flown with scoot 2 times scoot was the worst airlines i have ever experienced i wont fly with it ever again  josh nice video starting music  that is the worst dreamliner i never seen this befor ynwa  they are selling the idea of buying cheap plane tickets and treat yourself with a nice hotel plus tour with the money you saved not the other way around like tiring yourself making yourself disgruntled first before boarding a scoot flight btw they do have streaming if i am not wrong  they usually allocate seats together under the same booking i flew with them many times and i always get to sit together with my friends families scoot is not cheap nowadays for their short haul flight jetstar asia is a lot more attractively priced but there are always some bargains such as the direct flights to osaka and australia  i agree with this airasia x sell a set of meal water for rm15 however scoot sell a set of meal for dollar17 that is around rm51  have been flown with them long haul athens to singapore halal meal is limited or maybe non so put aside scoot and choose premium airlines  air asia everything is amazing except for the seat and legroom scoot absolutely everything is dog shit  india has biggest and cheapest mobile data network in the world  fly ti bali from singapore with air asia they operate direct flight from singapore also jetstar is a good choice too with decent flight time as well  pity about the lounge access  you could have spent time in cinema and swimming pool in the airport cheers j c was conisidering scoot from gold coast ool next year but air asia flies from ool amp bne so air asia it is thanks as always legend  you are the best aviation reviewer honest and down to earth your flights always look half empty how do you do that  no arguements airasia the best  literally the only long haul aircraft with no ife if ryanair had a 787 this might be it i just flew scoot round trip from singapore to the philippines i found the airline excellent value i paid for emergency exit and board me first a very low premium i did not order food eating a delicious meal in the amazing singapore airport i have travelled to 115 countries and fly constantly carry on only pay for the low cost seat upgrades at booking no complaints modern plane lots of room good value  you could have found the day beds in t3 that are free to use   joshcahill you said that there was no recline but some of the footage showed your seat reclined nok air is the best low cost carrier i have used baggage is cheap as are flight cost  great content josh  you have to know how low cost carriers work before you take it if you want to fly tomorrow and buy your ticket today you pay top fare if you travel with another friend and you book on the same reference the chances of sitting together is very high prebook your meal you get certain discount prebook your baggage it will be cheaper then buying it on check in entertainment bring your own laptop  hi josh you might want to try citilink indonesia the growing lcc of garuda indonesia they would be a better option than scoot i guess come on come on ynwa  great review josh  review doesnt start until 6 minutes into the video i did try scoot once from hong kong to singapore with the dreamliner very early morning flight at 7am i feel that the crews were so far nice seat was comfy your experience gives me a feel that scoot ryanair haha the low cost king in asia of course airasia for europe i prefer ryanair favourite  thank you josh wanted to really know about it who is the worst passenger in the history of your channel spicejet nepal air or egypt airline lady hi josh i live in r p as an expat and fly to perth australia normally twice a year as i fund all my own travels i mostly use lcc as there are so many choices if i was to choose the most reliable lcc i would likely say air asia i have had the least delays and never yet had a flight schedule change i use 5j alot as i am a sucker for cheaper prices but i must say they are the most unreliable lcc consistently changes to schedules and always delaying flights i can not recall the last time i was not delayed in saying that they have provided me very cheap fares given you book ahead of time and with there famous 1 piso fare promotion i used them recently to guam similar flight time between sin and mnl for dollar75usd roundtrip that is an absolute bargain jetstar asia i find decent but once again i do not use them as much as i once did since they no longer operate sin per like cebu pacific jetstar asia have a tendency to reschedule flights which is a hassle as in customer service and on time departures 3k are sound finally scoot i have had my fair share of schedule changes with them and you make an excellent point their flight timings are always early morning or late night which makes connections often prolonged singapore changi i agree is an excellent airport to be stuck at on my last long lay over i walked the entire t3 to t1 to t2 airside and noted the best sleeping areas for future trips as long as you have a pillow changi provide some decent seats and benches for resting one last mention on scoot in january of 2018 my flight was retimed out of per meaning my 2 hr connection in sin was cut my original connection was a red eye leaving singapore about 1am the next available flight was not until around 4pm i know for a fact that the majority of lcc would simply rebook you on the next flight without much in terms of compensation scoot was very generous and i had a free stay at the crowne plaza t1 with buffet meals included i was very surprised they were so generous to sum it up you simply get what you pay for personally flying sectors of 5 hrs or less i can not justify the full service costs sq is my favourite carrier but still the 5 hr rule applies exception expiring sq krisflyer miles which i will consume safe travels to all michael 11dollar that is pretty cheap if we compare to canadian airlines is it the airline that does not allow you to bring your own food or drink on board if it is true it would be a hard no from me would never fly an airline with such policy in place  it is crazy cos i just realised your malaysia video last night and i am singaporean and you just posted so  o people are still wearing short jeans  do what i did when i arrived on scoot airlines at 3 40am they have transit hotels got a nice 6 hours sleep are you allowed to bring your own food on board  air asia and thai smile are one of the best lcc in asia well if you have to spend 7 hours in an airport let it be changi  respect your real review  i have heard of it i would not mind flying it safety is my no 1 priority no 2 is food lol red from the review it is a fairly ok lcc so i think the title is kind of misleading  i just think its a waste of a beatiful dreamliner to have it with those ugly uncomfortable seats with no entertainment its like having a buggati but you just keep taking dump in it have they changed their rules about not being able to bring your own food and drinks on board  amazing good video is josh the best youtube er in aviation fly asia x a330neo and share ur experience please  that sats lounge is appalling made the no 1 lounge at bhx look amazing  i do not think josh has flown with many european low cost airlines it is the same model you get allocated a random seat or pay for a seat allocation no free food or drinks last week i flew edinburgh gothenburg gdansk edinburgh for dollar50 total with wizzair and ryanair my favourite european lcc is laudamotion surfshark is headquartered in the privacy friendly british virgin islands interesting research a corporate tax haven  even united does that kind of thing with the seat selection on the lowest fare most ridiculous on scoot is that you need to pay for the power socket or did they change it in asia i prefer airasia the food is quiet decent and fairly priced in my option  i absolutely agree with your observation i flew them once and that is all it took for me to know i will never fly them again  airasia amg indigo best low cost so it is basically a giant ryanair with headrests  hello josh a very good explanation you have given about the so called budget airline scoot also i have seen several of your other videos and have been well impressed also may i ask where are you from as you have a bit of a mixed accent like usa or australia or something as i am curious to know thanks so that it so take care and cheerio how lucky you are always get window seat  but this time not have not got any window seat surprising nothing surprise even though i am from singapore i avoid scoot as much as possible the in flight meals drinks is slightly more expensive than airasia but since i am already flying lcc why not just save the extra dollar and use the money to buy stuff at the country i am flying to i am much too much of a princess to fly on a low cost carrier and endure that kind of torture thanks for taking the hit josh for all of us who now will not have to go through the pain and suffering very creative and honest review  have you tried the scoot or silent hope you have a review on it i have booked a flight from cebu singapore on their premium one hope you could answer me thank you  congrats on the 199k  hey josh ynwa  try jetstar so called low cost airlines r actually not very low ticket is little cheaper but the stress they give is huge  hey josh great video but here is my take on a couple of things 1 scoot is a budget brand of singapore airlines and i feel that they are just using singapore airlines brand to charge at a higher price 2 as a proud singaporean myself dollar15 for food on a plane is not steep but a total rip off 3 u are quite lucky that the plane landed early as i have never had a great experience 4 5 times they had delays 4 the service from the crew also feels like a crew that is higher on budget 5 lastly ur question on who is the king of budget airline i would say air asia is still the best hands down from the ground crew all the way to the flight crew service cost flight timings no issues at all sorry for taking up too much of ur time to but in my thoughts but once again thanks for the great video rating cleaners is so nice i always appreciate those hard working people at busy airports  josh i guess we have some connection in last nepal airlines flight the worst person next to your seat was my professor whom i do not like either and the team you support liverpool is my favourite club as well have a great game tonight ynwa  have a nice time in singapur i think air asia is definitely king of low cost in asia so close to 200k  your videos are great the best channel on here for the best info for airlines and flights helps so much keep going amazing big love always xx great review up till today i still dislike the name scoot awful name for an airline  it is 2am   heyy josh cahill i am from singapore i am a big fan of your and your videos vlogs haha have a safe amp sound trip to where your heading to lol lmfao lmao yolo when you were in sg did you visited jewel changi  i thought we had only aviation in common glad to know that you are a red too d you should also mention that they will also need it if they are going to china i think air asaia is the best at low cost in this region and love your blogs very informative josh great stuff thank you hi joshhhhhhhh  give me a like pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee air asia and indi go are the best budget airlines in asia that time lapse tho  i had to once wait at bilbao airport for like 7 5 hours because the flight was early morning 6 15 am and the last bus departed from the city at 10 in the night worst thing yet to come the terminal closed never knew such a thing exists at night and so i was awake the whole night near the car parking basement you are definitely lucky to be waiting at changi airport  liverpool yeah  your very own version of the terminal  loved the video only complaint is that you support liverpool not a big fan of that part  looks like every airport turned into a home for ya  i would prefer easyjet than scoot anyway another good vid josh  my back would be killing me after a flight with a no recline seat enjoyed this video  i flew with scoot to osaka last year during the typhoon season my cousin was on a singapore airlines flight to the same destination departing around the same time roughly a 10 am departure if i remember correctly i would woken up early in the morning gone to the airport waited all the way until boarding and it was then that someone from scoot held an ipad walking around to inform us that the flight departure had been delayed by over 12 hours due to a typhoon my cousin was informed by sq of this delay the night before and stayed comfortably at home until the subsequent night departure this blew my mind considering that sq fully owns scoot  airasia the best budget flight in the world please review thai airways i am waiting for your review then i will book my tickets on it business class of 777 200 300  hero  4 41 that is what you call dedication to vlogging ummmm for jetstar and air asia you can not choose your seats either if you want you get a window aisle seat you can go to the desk and ask them if you can have that seat or when you board the airplane just let the attendant know if there is any available they will definitely swap for you meals wise the price is pretty much the same as jetstar and air asia but their food to be honest taste great their seats are actually more spacious and comfortable compared to air asia in my opinion i love their friendly staffs too however you are right that the price of the flight is not cheap it is at least 50sgd more than jetstar air asia i used to fly scoot a lot but changed to other airlines instead because i do not think i am willing to pay the extra 50bucks just for a little more comfort moreover sometimes the international airlines eg cathay mh sq have the similar prices for the same routes so i take them instead i was just there love from bangladesh  airasia x the best lcc mostly always fly the low cost carriers off this little rock that is jersey not that there is much choice to be fair i do swap between easyjet and flybe and have never found an issue with either yes the extra for luggage ect but they are normally far cheaper than ba not always have scored cheaper flight with ba but to be fair now they are not a full service airline in economy on short haul there is no difference between them but it is hard to fight the low cost airlines i am flying from jersey to edinburgh to see family for christmas for gbp9 99 each way including carry on you can not really complain about anything for that price choosing a seat for a 2hour flight is not an issue either will be interesting to see how flybe evolve now they have been bought over by virgin  josh if you flight scoot you either try to save a lot of money or there is no other choice lion air hold my beer  my concern with scoot is not so much that you have to pay for things but that the condition of the cabin is just poor in the few times i have flown them their seats were dirty and there was trash in the pockets i am not expecting the plane to be completely dirt free but it was just horrendous  does not scoot also not allow for customers to bring their own food on board unless they changed their policy  a young member of our family travelled with an infant from perth to sydney with tigerair australia the lcc of virgin then sydney to singapore with scoot the tigerair plane was small and cramped but the cabin crew were very kind and helpful with the little one on scoot the opposite excellent plane but the cabin crew were absolutely unhelpful the little fellow was crying and she was getting blamed she eventually fled with him to the toilet and sat there with him until he went to sleep then returned to her seat and held him asleep all the way to singapore scoot is a technically competent airline safe and reliable but for international lcc travel from australia my choice would be jetstar or air asia and on both of these airlines if you pre pay luggage and a meal you get almost what you get on a full service airline  ynwa josh  me tries to skip cahills advert  youtube gives me and advert  youtube my powers have doubled since the last time we fought 3 years ago qf reintroduced perth to singapore flights after a short absence that was great but the downside was that they stuck a 737 on the route so for me it was 5 hrs stuck in a qf 737 full service yes but definitely not international quality vs scoot 787 i actually preferred scoot  anyway qf have come to their senses and they now use a330 is i actually flew scoot for berlin to singapore and didnt see that you can not bring your own food on this long trip so whils i was eating my sandwich that i boughr the fa strongly warned me to eat it fast and what i did was wrong embarassing me among my felllow passengers everyone else though bought their snacks but wasnt warned never flying them ever  josh you are lfc fans so great so lovely   sup  the videi quilety was good but the airline is so worst to traveler with out intertentment he heh ehe great video but i can not understand the negative opinions of some viewers in my opinion price and performance are in harmony with scoot thanks for the tip about vpn   emirates charges about 35 usd for one way seat selection kills me every time  seven hours at changi do not think you will be exhausted at the worlds best airport  indigo is the best low cost airline in asia  airasia x has the better food but scoot definitely has the better aircraft for long haul flights now that is what i call a nightmareliner airasia is foods are much more delicious and cheaper why you do not go to a lounge  scoot is expensive airline thank you josh if they give me free ticket no way flying with scoot by the way changi is the worst airport ever after midnight it is dead airport are you believe all singapore lounges close when i am travelling from syd to bkk via changi on singapore business class i stoke in airport no lounge and hotels is fully booked with no choice i access private lounge by credit card  love you josh best airline reviewer reviewing the worst dreamliner  but scoot has dead cheap fares from chennai to singapore cheaper than indigo most often wait until you have tried ryanair   low cost king in asia gotta be air asia i guess and the worst is a toss up between lion air and scoot  yes i avoid scoot i even booked a thai airways to bkk and then onto sin on sq avoid scoot if you can  some people say that asian low cost airlines are better than european and american low cost ones josh tiger merged with scoot in 2017 so they are really no alternative what your review ignored is that there are two groups of people when it comes to lcc those that book checked luggage food amp seat assignment at time of booking and those that will simply do without these services basically next to nobody pays them those prices listed in the menu scoot days bringing your own food is forbidden but with so few staff that seems rather difficult to enforce fun fact 1 even if you book in what they refer to as business class on their long haul overnight trips to from athens or berlin i believe premium economy is more accurate for what you get you will still have to pay if you want a pillow or blanket fun fact 2 there was the case of a german ngo guy who saw those food prices after having booked a ticket and contacted scoot and told them he would go on a hunger strike in protest he then had to take the threat back i believe scoot told him they would not honor the ticket if he carried out the threat but come day of the trip what did he do just had water which was seen as the same thing end of story he is found himself blacklisted for life from scoot tiger if you go on their website the list something like 25 reasons that will get you banned and making threats even this type which is mostly harming yourself is one of them  i was driving from germany to the netherlands when i saw you uploading the video i could not wait to get home and even crossed the speed limits again another great video josh  picking and choosing your assigned seat is a business in itself these days  i love it when josh is angry and grumpy about things hai i am fly scoot its not low cost i prefer airasia in case of low budget airline it is best their food is reasonable they have lovely seat but in the scoot everything is costly seats are not that good in short they are not low budget airline lion group is king of sea lcc most of their crew are based in malaysia  wonderful video ynwa i flew scoot biz mel sin dmk once that was truly awful  another amazing video mate try jetstar josh they are also really good at fleecing passengers i am a big fan of ur from india  i had been waiting for this review you have summed up my experience except i flew with them mel to sin i often joke that they made me pay per sheet of toilet paper never again long haul  flew scoot 787 from melbourne to bangkok dmk via singapore and one of the most uncomfortable flights i have ever been on the most annoying thing was the light and flight attendant call buttons on the arm rest which were pressed every time you leaned on them not a place i want to be spending 7 and a half hours again anytime soon they are probably one of the only airlines in the world to order the dreamliner without ife   4 41 you placed your camera in the trashbin  do you own a pair of long pants lol you would think the gate staff could reissue you with a new boarding pass love the review you get what you pay for josh if you have to spend a long time at an airport changi is the best  also the cleanest bathrooms of any airport in the world you are a brave man i would never fly scoot unless i had no other option  i do agree with you about the prices of food seats etc i flew with them twice on their dreamliner from singapore to gold coast in comparison to air asia x they have better seats and i had really good sleep as it was an overnight flight on a 7 8 hours flight and the food was not bad at all however i still feel that air asia x have better service and the price you pay is still worth it though the seats are a bit cramped i would go for air asia for the price but would still fly scoot if there are no better in terms of the cost  they charge dollar5 for a glass of water  great video josh low cost king for me is indigo and airasia josh you will agree for sure for indigo it is mostly on time flew them from chennai to spore quite good service is consistent timing is better than airasia for airasia service is okay and food is damn good however the full price including the add ons can be expensive for my case  huge fun wow josh your video clips are really amazing you have taken a large variety of flights from first class in the most luxury airlines in the world to an economy class seat in a low cost airline  i would rather fly jetstar than with scoot i tried the singapore melbourne route on their dreamliner and i will never be on it again ever  the only budget airline i would fly is virgin australia i have flown jetstar in australia and they are not great i would never fly scoot airlines and this video backs me up but in all seriousness josh if you have not already try virgin australia both domestically and internationally they are better than you think  i would say it is air asia the best have not flown with scoot but i guess they are like spicejet of india  i have flown scoot a few times from aus to sin and v v at the right price they are fantastic i am talking dollar150 aud one way once the fares move into the 250 400 range one way the value quickly decreases one other positive is they ans airasia are pretty good for last minute fares compared to a full service last minute  i would nt touch scoot if it was free  scoot is just to much i once flew them from bangkok to taipei and they did not even serve free glass of water that is something which pissed me and there prices are not so cheap compared to other full service carriers on the same route overall not gonna fly scoot  good i would never fly them i think the flight was quite alright the only issue was the boarding process josh i like that you fly all the different classes on the airlines and are not afraid to admit when you have a positive experience in economy or a negative experience in business or first class it gives me a much better picture of what different airlines are like i suffer from spinal spondylosis and am confined to a wheelchair i recently had a heart attack but doctors tell me i may return to the air in the spring japan and singapore are on my bucket list of places to visit my dad is retired navy and he especially loved singapore he tells me it is so beautiful there would you be able to recommend any airlines that are kind to the physically handicapped i belong to delta is sky rewards so i tend to be partial to someone who partners with delta as delta takes very good care of me do not know if that makes a difference or not your wisdom would be greatly appreciated thanks  scoot we charge you 11dollar to select a seat british airways hold my beer we chare 100gbp to select a seat great  proper review thankyou ur all videos are good  hey josh what is that something that always gets me excited about your videos haha and yes i would say focus more on budget or economy travel because that is what many people look for when traveling first time cheers  good review seems expensive but glad yoou got some sleep  one time one of the scoot cabin crew saw my boarding pass and halfway through the flight without me knowing they turned on the rainbow lights and gave me a free chocolate cause it was my birthday even though scoot is bad in quality and most service it has a special place in my heart  yh thats really the worst dreamliner its a 787 not a dreamliner as scoot aint a dream jetstar is much better  great review  i can not help thinking of people doing rock paper scissors for a seat swap  hahahahaha   im very confused as to why you are bitching about a low cost carrier the main premise of scoot is to get you from point a to b thats it you decide if you want anything else as you decided to fly a low cost airline of course all the extras are way overpriced as thats how they make money if you want food drinks and entertainment fly a main airline simple completely unnecessary video  i would rather fly air koryo in an old soviet jet that is not far from dropping out of the sky than fly scoot  they really do put the low class into low cost  the timelapse was phenomenal josh   i am starting to miss your classic grey jumper keep up the great work  nice video  wonderland scoot where nightmares become a reality your review was very tactfully done l truly could not have been as diplomatic as you josh well done for the torture you endured for us  surprised you did not grab sleep at one of the many airside hotels at changi  i support liverpool too  air asia is the king south east asia they captured the market in various countries  as always love your channel but to get the shot of you throwing the wiping paper was it really necessary to put the camera in the garbage great video you are the best travel youtuber  hmm  they charge you for everything but do they charge you for using the lavatory  congratulations for your dream jouney josh i am a big fan of yours and the next time if you are in singapore is it possible for me to meet up with you also great review no josh no not liverpool bro haha airasia gt scoot amazing video do air arabia sounds like you can only use mobile boarding passes through wechat the info is confusing though i would love to see their response to this video the fact that the gate could not print is pathetic though  cool at  at least it is rare to find an airlines that uses b787 at least you can spend 7 hrs at changi no scoot for me even in their so called premium seats would rather walk  you should try jetstar 787 economy which is good for 2 3 hour flights not for 8 hours you are the best josh my guy supports liverpool ynwa another awesome video josh scoot are probably not as good as ryanair  i have watched first  can u believe that scoot parent company is singapore airlines lol  really good video josh my new favourite channel  less than a minute into the upload and only seconds into the video and josh your videos still manage to impress me  i have a herpa 1 50 0 model of this plane hey why do not you follow me on  as well see you over there  hey i watched first i flying in and out of incheon hi may i know if that is the super seat or the stretch seat  the funny thing is when you add in all the basic extras like checked baggage and seat selection on a scoot flight it is basically the same price as their parent carrier singapore airlines for the same flight on the same day and time there is barely a dollar30 difference in a flight i am pricing from phuket to bali on the same day in the morning between these two carriers the only difference is the singapore airlines price upfront is the total cost and the scoot initial price is a low cost teaser fare that is never the final price  did the booking page say it wasa pok mon livery plane or cookie box  it is pretty silly to review a budget airline flight everything is just utilitarian what you pay is what you get the main thing is a reputable budget airline like scoot will convey you from a to b in a competent manner with no frills  really great video you should have much more subs i have never heard about scoot airlines before does changi have water vending machines at the gate seeing as you can not take liquid past gate security  thanks for the awesome reviews i am doing scoot a321neo from and to hkg to sin 787 9 singapore to sydney and return  12 06 takeoff to absolutely enjoyed your videos scoot is one of the best low cost airlines in the world just after airasia  i flew economy singapore to sydney return the worst long haul seats i have ever come across avoid at all costs  jayden what if in the future delta american british airways westjet zipair lufthansa and air france comes to melbourne  scoot is the worst airline ever  brush your hair first  are you in hk base  scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money  i have taken scoot both regional and long haul regional is to penang and bangkok and that is about the limit of my endurance for a 28 seat pitch if we are checking in luggage a mainline flight is preferable sing or thai if it is to bangkok because with the luggage fees added in it is often really close in price on long haul it was narita to bangkok don meuang at the time and we did scoot business far more comfortable and it included a meal and something to drink the seat was more like a mainline premium economy seat than a true business class seat but as it was a daytime flight that was fine we will be doing scoot biz from narita to sing in november the flight was significan notly lower in price than any mainline airline it is an lcc so i set my expectations accordingly are they great no but they generally get me to where i am going with a minimum of inconvience  i am considering scoot to fly mel sin in october unsure if better to fly the afternoon flight or the night flight thanks so much for the review btw i notice that scoot charges dollar19aud for food seems excessive is it better to buy when you are on board  great review thanks to you i would never fly scoot they have taken flying back 30 years thats how it used to be  who that guy behind you  it is unimaginable that some locals do not know about tuen mun light rail  i flew cathay before do you live in tuen mun hi jayden does your seat 13a have more legroom than the other seats in the same row when i tried to buy a seat i found out that seat 13a b c was charged as superseats which cost more than seat 13h j k which they charged as standard seat assignment  good price but not worth it for a long haul flight agree with you totally you are cute but wow what a bedroom haha  hi jayden how much was the airfare thanks great as always  idea for next video just review your cats lt 3 i am on scoot is neo in economy to bali next april after arriving on sq a350 in premium but it is only 2hrs 40mins so it is not to bad  love your channel love your walk through the flight the meal did look a little bland you do a good explanation of your flights very intertaining  thanks for the trip report wow we have to pay for the power outlet to charge the phone and tablet that is annoying same for me i would not fly scott and it is the worst unless it is cheap tomorrow i am flying scoot from melbourne to singapore this time on a afternoon flight  thanks another great video thanks jayden when making reference to legroom i was wondering about your height can you divulge  such a cute and exciting opening i love it hihi you should probably remove the part where you eat a meal with your friend at changi before he gets implicated staff are not allowed to interact with passengers in this manner on the airside for security purposes  great video jayden boy that did not look like a great value the meal you ordered looked pretty terrible and i can not believe they charge to use the power socket also the legroom on the second flight was terrible i have heard you also can not bring your own food onboard is that true i can see why you would want to avoid them in the future  jayden live in tuen mun i thought u just drive your car when u go out  t3 because scoot is a singapore airlines subsidiary  scoot is a low cost airline subsidiary of singapore airlines for a low cost airline i find the service pretty good sometimes the crew will also host fun activities on board the longer flights such as guess the country flag on a flight from sin kix to entertain the passengers on board for the price of food it is towards the expensive side sdollar4 for a canned drink in singapore will cost at most sdollar2 instead so it makes more sense to fly scoot to a regional destination as it is more compared to flying sq  what a girly voice  hi jayden in my opinion scoots inflight pricing is a little overpriced do not know if they have made price changes since compared to its competition jet star asia also based in sg not the oz based jetstar of course u knew that its different  between scoot and the previous tiger air id still prefer tiger for in flight pricing other than that the idea of scoot is good so jetstar asia is my go to when fliying from sg to iindonesia in my case  also scoot have funny rules like not being able to bring outside snacks  do not know if they tweak that since  good share  how much did they charge to use the rest room  if i booked on singapore and got scoot i would be pissed i am not sure if it is appropriate to request a specific flight but could you please do a review on qantas a330 sydney gt haneda i know you did this 6 years ago melb narita but just wondering if there is been a refresh  cool your trip reports make want to fly with scoot airlines someday do not think i will be flying scoot at all not good but nice legs by the way and cute cats at home   thank you for your review jayden your reviews are always so informative and helpful honestly as a singaporean having the same sentiment as u if i can fly by other airlines i will if i have to take scoot the flight will not be more than 2 hours for me or no other choice which i really doubt scoot is standard has dropped quite drastically ever since they amerged with tiger airways and has been dropping  nice trip report  can not wait to back in hk after 3 year of covid in december  thanks for another report i do not think i will try scoot anytime soon hahah the legroom is pretty awful  never iscoot lol jayden have you tried pooping on an airplane  we just flew scoot this march april ool coolangatta via sin to ho chi minh city sgn vietnam price was just over dollar2 4k return for 3 of us i am certain they stuffed our meals up dollar53 aud for 2 rolls w drink and small chicken meal the flight attendant was not going to budge when i questioned i am sure there more  return home last thursday we took our own snacks as did quite a few others on all flights  not sure if we will use them next time probably vietjet direct brisbane to saigon or singapore airlines have also flown air asia x 5 times and their meals are way better for similar price   in my opinion as a hongkonger the new territories light rail is pretty underrated and not as well known partly because it is situated far away from the city centre i find them pretty convenient to travel on between places in that area  i terracing that u dared fly scoot jayden oh god u used an unfriendly skies pillow you should have eaten at hungry jack is what time can you speak chinese scoot is a great airline with great staff but the food has always been very ordinary although i like your videos i do hope you get refused boarding one day as you continually break the rule with your overweight cabin baggage you obviously knew it was too much but went ahead anyway just irresponsible  another great video greetings from salt lake city  my wifey you do not need much room because i can get your ankles behind your ears  malaysia airlines also has a b c d zone boarding but they never use the system in australia you should review vietjet t way and air vanuatu that has recently lauched fllights from syd mel well after watching your scoot trip i def wont ever fly with them just because they are a cheap carrier that doesnt mean they have to ignore their chores like gathering up rubbish and at least a free water and to remember cutlery if you ordered a meal that was terrible on their behalf omg what was wrong with the black cats face eyes poor thing hope you had fun with your family qatar airways vlog  their airfares are only cheap if you do not have checked in luggage and do not need food add in the lack of entertainment and the cramped conditions medium to long haul flights on budget airlines are often poor value  scoot the king of delays like very long delay more than an hour   please get medicine for your cat is eye infection unless you already have tended to her interesting trip information i have always had to fly economy but these days i do not know that it is worth it  l enjoyed this video becos of a few things your first scoot flight and not surprising i will only fly scoot if it is 2 hrs or less you are a hero didi for taking this long flight but hey as you said good value i reckon it will be less painful since i am a shorty at 1 7m food u are right the worst food when compared to other lcc but the wink from the ground crew was on point what happened to your hair and i love that watch always seen in your videos wonder where you got it from  def the a321neo would be ok for a short flight to penang and i love the cute character on the winglet no power supply yes it is a bumper why pay for power it is nuts w hour delay but of cos becos scoot stands for sure cannot operate on time  scoot ugh is it worse than ryanair jayden i would never judge my favourite avgeekhunk even though i do tease you occasionally  plz bring baby no 1 to the vet  sexy legs jw  why is hungry jacks so similar to burger king  it was t1 and not t3 you were at was not it  no ife system    back of the seat  they should provide this facility like emirates  coat hook  oh so you take the new tunnel to the airport your in the north area scoot is another airlines i has not flown whit great trip report lol and i thought jetstar were bad with charging for everything charging to use the power supply is a bit steep great video once again mate  hi jayden thank you for the video on scoot not for me neither only if it was an emergency food did not look very good ah well i suppose that what you get on low budget airlines yes you thought they would have given out water  hi i do not think you remember but i told you that i went to the uk last year and after that i flew  melbourne to singapore on scoot so yea love your vids  lol i used to accidentally find airline pillows in my luggage i have not flown red eye in economy in a very time and i will finally do it to europe in december ycl the entire way  wait how did you get the finnair and united polaris pillows  you woke that grumpy cat up from its sleep hahahaha  to be honest i would rather take scoot if its 2 hr flight or shorter the seat looked good there seems plenty of legume with plenty of mushroom must be a wake up kale from the thai jet next to it just says it all do not settle for medi okra  nice video wow charging for power supply i do not understand how do they know if you are charging thks so do u work  thank you for suffering low cost so that we do not have to but i must say the price is decent enough to make one think twice never heard of the hk light rail system must explore it when i visit later this year cheers oh god scoot congrats on surviving xd when i flew them from honolulu to osaka they were very insistant on no outside food and drink to force you to buy their gruel i just slept instead haha and they also only had immigration customs cards in chinese for some reason  i am surprised they do not charge you dollar5 to use the coat hook  hungry jacks was probably better than the melbourne amex lounge anyway  great fare fantastic landing video of a321 neo  scoot is an absolute rubbish airline and nobody should have to endure their lack of amenities and service on a long haul flight avoid at all cost  hello jayden you are great and i enjoy your video been subscriber your channel as i do not want to miss you next flights  this is my experience review spore airlines from indonesia to hong kong thanks so much youtuber is friend  inside the flight vlog i noticed that you looked through the meals at least they noticed that they have the allergens advice i assume that most of the meals contain at least gluten however there is no seat pockets but from the singapore hong kong flight you are transiting from a stormy singapore to a sunny hong kong city  you are so yummy and handsome  good flight review on scoot very nice jayden  what is wrong with your black cat very disturbing i was surprised the train announcements were in english  hello jayden how are you travelling often is vlogging your full time job  is united polaris pillow a latex one i felt it is different from others when i was flying united i am gonna go ahead and help you with the algorithm by providing a coat hoooook time stamp 15 00  long leg problem be lyk  can u fly bonza like me  what an excellent trip report was at melbourne last week hope you enjoyed your flights btw will you do any trip reports from brisbane if u can that would be great  good morning from germany jaydon   stay safe and healthy  yep important in an lcc review to eat onboard and i also like to see what the reviewer is reading charging for trons an outrage good review  i was in adelaide last weekend and saw an aeroplane whizz by overhead i thought to myself is mr wong in that slurping on some champagne  i think lcc are for short haul what you think  great review of scoot mate been waiting for a review of them  they should have scooted faster with the first flight that excuse for a meal was ridiculous no frills at all wow  nice video again jayden the price is definitely a great deal to fly long haul btw planning to go eu this summer but i am struggle in whether choose to fly with egypt air or lot jayden d  beautiful boy  hungry jacks is not a budget choice at least at the airport haha  i always take my sleeping pill just before take off while flying with low cost airline when i wake up i have arrived at my destination  hey jayden you are the best always mate   great video jayden are u going to fly qantas anytime soon  good review very comprehensive unfortunately no coat hook in your seat  but luckily you managed to see your beloved coat hook in the lavatory   great job as always jayden nice to see your bright smile and bubbly personality coming through they add excitement to every video scoot is a great deal on price but oh that awful looking minestrone would not have bothered better to bring your own food i read somewhere anyone who says they have never paid for air never bought a bag of potato chips  it is always true there is more air than chips in those bags you should try to make a point of visiting the us just to fly our low cost carriers ex spirit and southwest to see how they compare i fly southwest often but compared to scoot it is really not low cost i hear spirit is build your own ticket but i do not need to save money that badly thanks for a great video  well well kimchi cup noodles wonder what that smells like lol i like kimchi fermented cabbage take packets of spices with you for bland food the anime on the winglet was cute hukes on a scute i guess you are giving scoot the boot i do not blame you the poor black cat i have a black cat with an eye problem also thanks jayden brightened my day  must bring a large tablet and glue it on seat board there we do not go to die bro has no tvs on board and is worst  no charging point  i love scoot best service in my life and the staffs were nice and friendly help scoot thank u for the best service in my life we would love to book your airline scoot   worst dreamliner ever by nice tour     and dreamliners for low cost carriers  ryanair but you have to stay 12 hours the horror plane you have the worst economy ever  scoot is a criminal enterprise that cancels flights and issues fake travel vouchers without passengers consent and later uses these fraudulent vouchers to dispute the charge backs raised by affected passengers like me  commerican 1000 no business class  i went on 1 today they did not have any neon lights it was disapoinitng pls do not tell me delay is very normal thing for u all because not enough aircraft haha nice tour scoot  follow me for daily updates on  see you over there  what about the severely disable service for blind passengers  so interesting that the entire area was empty and i am glad you showed the front row as that is where i will be seated tmw on my flight from singapore to japan who cares if the crew are not around talking to the passengers i would rather they chill until you actually need something instead of constantly walking around doing nothing  never fly with these dodgy grubs this airline is an absolute scammer crap food low service no responsibility for damaged belongings as they crushed our pram during our flight from phuket to sydney and took no responsibility blaming us for not purchasing insurance you pay less and end up paying more than a standard flight in the end unprofessional and dodgy as fark this are the business class seats from the 1990th had the pleasure to fly this seats on lh to buenos aires hongkong sao paulo and tokio yes that was a dark time luckily first class had already flatbeds that time  heck scoot plus is way better than singapore airlines economy seat  why is the audio right ear only  scoot is our version of spirit in australia flying on a widebody on this flight is nice but i also agree that the price for business class of it did not worth bro this is a long haul flight ultra low cost airline the seats are already uncomfortable enough and this isnt just a 2h flight most of the time scoot also flies athens to singapore for example and thats like a 10 h flight that would be an unbearable experience for all involved including the large gentleman lady they lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate i curse them immidiate bankrupt i looked at the prices for this scoot business class manila to bangkok against philippines airlines business class and the philippines airlines was a far better price and the business class is a real business class prices for this coming november philippines 58000 pesos scoot 70000 pesos no brainier  is not the great legroom in bulkhead available only in the middle row in scoot plus and only on some of the 787 8 i noticed that you can not stretch in bulkhead if you are in ab or hk  it is economy plus lol not business i do not know about you guys but everytime i fly scoot it is not bad at all just the delay times but i always got insurance for it  was your tummy okay joshie  i had a misconnection with singapore airlines budget carrier scoot last month due to delay no big deal but when i asked for a confirmation letter from scoot for my insurance claim they refused to give it even when the governing laws i am flying from malaysia by the malaysian government that they are legally required to provide letter within 7 days if the flight delayed more than 30 minutes my flight that caused the misconnection was delayed for 2 hours until now they still refuse to provide me with the misconnection letter god just a confirmation letter for misconnection there is no monetary liability for them yet they refuse to provide do not fly scoot or even singapore airlines period  there is no screen with video or entertainment  my suitcase was lost on the scooter 5 months ago until now no news called emailed no answer i have put it in consumer media and reported it to the ministry of transportation because scoot seems to be out of control very strong contrast between tr amp sq in the same family  no sound in most parts just small voice over clips here and there crew chillin around on a nearly empty flight thats some awefull service   singapore to sydney worst flight ever will never fly with scoot forever  if his is a mushroom yeah i want it just took a sq economy flight to hong kong and returned on a codeshare scoot flight the crew on sq are always attentive regardless of the class i am flying whereas the crew on my scoot flight was just doing their job did not even get a smile or goodbye on my way out guess you get what you pay for  i can not be the only one who fast forwards to check out the meal  i just flew sydney to singapore to berlin via scoot economy worst flight super uncomfortable no water even in economy a lot of people including myself did not know you needed to bring your own food and drinks then when going through the boarding gate security in singapore the water and food i brought along was confiscated so i had a 14 hour flight with out and water or food  i thinl thats fair for obese peiple to have to but two tickets not many people really review this airline just sq interesting to view haha in my opinion it still worth to fly this budget airline with b787 why as long as wifi services provide in the flight i still can enjoy entertainment from my ipad like general commercial carrier does i may not put high expectations on food since it is budget airline but i rather recommend them distribute fast food instead local budget food store  many of you know b787 is the most modern and safe aircraft in the world it can get rid off unpredictable turbulence event happen during journey the wing flow can swing like a bird compare to other aircraft give constant momentum of air flow can help airline company save money on fuel consumption of course you still can enjoy business class or first class on the commercial carrier if you have enough money to do so it just an option for those people wish to take budget airline for their travel when they have budget constraints  pair of spoilt pansy is got it flights empty i recently flew gatwick to bangkok with scoot in economy and can best describe it as a discomfort endurance test the crew were ok but 12 hrs is a long flight especially when you are sat waiting to take off and you are delayed by an hr and a half no food or even drinking water no power outlets no entertainment nothing unless you pay extra fortunately i came prepared but being a first time scoot flyer i do not think i will use them again and as this vid has shown business class is not much better  this review helped me so much as a fat person i would rather pay gbp1000 on a luxury liner then buy 2 seats you want us to buy extra seats but your bathroom will not accommodate us thanks again for the review that vpn route to better pricing sure as heck did not work for me one way singapore to sydney and i was using a singapore server not guaranteed i guess did you notice a little button for calling an attendant a meal was included and they delivered it continual fawning was not included  thanks for the video i suspect that you dislike the fragrance of the chinese shiitake mushrooms it is probably an acquired taste for you since i do not find it in western cuisine but it is common in singapore even as a singaporean i dislike it when i was younger so i could totally relate to you when you said it does not taste like mushrooms but something else usually we will eat that dish with dark soya sauce and small chilies seems like it was not provided though cheers i do not know how but my earphones got better after ending this video how could they put these shitty seats in a brand new 787 when air asia has had lie flat beds for years now  ad after ad josh you are too funny i flew scoot business a few years ago the flight attendant told me i was not allowed to sleep through meal service on a red eye flight  hey josh great review thank you do those business class seats on scoot recling further and have more raised foot rest than we could see cheers mate happy travels glen and di there is something seriously wrong with the audio in this video  food looks awful  you are wrong fat people should not sit in half of my seat  for the economy class passengers 2 passengers can use a double outlet plug adapter that way its 2 for 1 dollar2 50 each there is always a work around haha give the air steward a tip usdollar100 upfront amp the scoot service is great good review it is an disappointment indeed that the crew has no much interest i believe that even a budget airline should provide service unless it is all self service why am i constantly deaf in the left ear except for some brief moments  they should copy airasia is business class  what 30 mb can do you  nope not into scoot i would rather fly with other airlines  compared the swiss long haul economy at least there are power plugs on scoot  can you please review royal air maroc b787 9 business class are these recorded in mono the last couple of video has only had sound on one channel and yes i checked other videos and they do not have this issue  most people on ath ber fly a3 easy or ryanair josh fly condor is 767 from dus or fra to spain or greece very nice legroom and excellent choice of meals you missed also this year is austrian is 777 200 vie her vie which was great and you get to fly business on economy prices their last flight was on the of the 4th of september they flew every saturday i also flew a fantastic edelweiss a340 on her zrh scoot airline is like a budget version of singapore airlines lmao on the 15 th kam air defected to lithuania kmf222 when will you review vistara is new 787 9 busy flight  hello from singapore  u came to singapore yay  there is someone here to help me i need money very much my mother is very sick there are more problems at home the rough house is collapsing i have a lot of kids in my house an accident can happen anytime the condition of the house is very bad no one comes to my aid no one believes me i am so compelled so you guys forgive me thanks hello josh you are my favorite human it is my birthday tomorrow can i get a happy birthday from you thank uuuu and to more safe flights with you i remeber the strike i was not happy about it whats app number come on josh you could have just forced mono audio from the recording when editing this now i have to go out of my way to find a script or a extension so i do not go mad only having audio on the right ear  great flight josh stop promoting adult movies for saudi you will regret it  i agree with scoot if someone is too large to fit in their seat then they should have to purchase a second seat it is not fair to the other passanger who is seat space is being invaded and i am on the veavier side finally the advertisement that saying the truth purpose of vpn use  im not a huge fan of scoot i prefer air asia the food is better  scoot from singapore down to australia is a great option so cheap usually  nice josh is going strong 411k awesome video josh i actually travelled on their dreamliner from my hometown to singapore i had a very bad experience but i made up my mind that i am travelling in a budget airline   great video i have flown scoot but in their early days with hand me down 777s from sq their service was reasonably good and the crew were attentive  as a travel agent when they first stepped into the european market i was at their promotion stand on the itb the big international travel and tourism fair in berlin they guy handed us pamphlets and we talked about what we as agents and our customers expect of an airline and they failed in almost every discussion point at one point even the brand representative laughed with us what a weird airline i actually did not think they would stay longer than this weird air france hipster youth airline but hey here we are today xd if the food smells sour then it is rotten spoiled that is the feeling you have now in your intestines what new airport in the netherlands you have the old schiphol amsterdam do you mean lelystad airport or rotterdam airport  etihad and qatar charge extra for bulkhead seats in economy scoot looked empty  wonderful bro fly the last a340 500  josh cahill come back to pakistan this is trivial i know i am passed the age of traveling but i really like to know how long the flight is thank you for reading what is going on with the audio josh  wait scoot charge for power outlets hahaha i am wonder how profitable this flight was as it seemed to be quite empty apart from that only flying on a big jet for a short range flight is more convenient and comfortable hassle free i guess  the french being more on strike than others is a myth in these last few years lufthansa has been much more on strike than air france and it also works for dbhan against sncf  as a singaporean nothing related to singapore is free  we flew scootbiz back in october 2017 melbourne singapore and back the flight to singapore was ok no priority boarding in melbourne although it said it was included on board they got the already ordered food wrong staff were older and very helpful also on the way back no priority boarding long lines at the gate had a younger group of hostesses and they were hopeless not only wrong sort of food we had already booked and paid for but we both received an ice cream instead of a meal to start with no apology when asked why and where were our ordered meals staff never came around to check on us we had 1a amp 1b we decided that the fares were not as cheap as they think they are and to fly singapore next time and pay more for what we want in business class sadly we do not look like getting back to singapore anytime soon we are locked down again in melbourne australia philltheflyer i have flown scoot several times in both classes on busy amp less than at times busy sectors the crew are never overly attentive or engaging they always rush even on a couple of occasions running through the passenger cabin without any valid reasons certainly a stark contrast to sq as you well know  i think you should try out wow air not sure if they still fly but if they do you should review them never again on scoot stewardess more like salesmen trying to sell u water could not find my business reservation put in economy refused to refund the difference could not then even find my booking had to go to intermetary to get refunded luckily i had my receipt to show the mediation when it goes wrong their mistake they will not help you likewise they overbook their flights and close tge checkin early leaving you stranded despite being in the queue they claim yiu do not checkin on time yeah no need to buy trouble from this airline  have watched many of your videos amp you always seem to dred having someone sitting next to you without some kind of divider even on short flights you have no problem engaging the crews but almost seem phobic about someone being near you on a passenger aircraft of all things  nice video very engaging from beginning to end nevertheless businesses and investment are easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office  sad they feed you cat food in business class i would be flying aegean airlines on that route no it is not on a dreamliner but having lounge access priority boarding a delicious meal attentive cabin crew far outweighs flying on a dreamliner for me  imho extra wide passengers should be required to purchase two seats no one in their right mind wants to have someone is fat encroaching their personal space  discrimination laws aside as a long haul flight attendant last century i have witnessed too many folk having their flights holidays ruined by an obese person trying to fit into a regular y c seat amp overflowing onto their seat neighbours i agree that they need to purchase 2 seats or travel in a premium class for their own comfort amp consideration of others the safety factor also needs to be considered obese folk are more difficult to evacuate in the event of emergency especially if they have requested an emergency row seat for the extra room which they are usually denied anyway i do not wish to sound discriminatory but it is what it is  were you flying private 787 why i saw no other passengers  please check bulgaria air it is so bad quality for much money greetings from bulgaria  that might be your best flight review yet thanks for having me fun flight it was  as a medical undergraduate and a volunteer working at the national covid center staying hydrated is of utmost importance infact what we give as advices for home based care patients are to have adequate bed rest with awake repositioning for each half an hour and staying hydrated 2 5 3 5 l day unless you have ckd or any renal dysfunction so staying hydrated is even better these days great review josh love from sri lanka  naize  i do not think it is discrimination if you are too fat and take up two seats that is just how it is those extra extra large people should buy 2 tickets for both of their seats that their fat spills onto i do not want someone is fat rolls touching me while i paid full price for my seat just because i am fit and take care of myself lol yuck however with that said i think most fat people can fit in 1 seat just fine it is the really fat people that you have to worry about and honestly i do not think those folks mind paying for 2 because they understand that their size can intrude others personal space  what is with your hand in your logo man wasting others time biden gift of 9 11 anniversary is 3 lacks brave afgans soldiers partner interpreters who can not fought talibans a us citizenship great video totally fair as usual really looking forward to seeing the afganni crew again the new scamhansa  had the same idea thank you  great video did you here from the airline from the feedback you mentioned  there should be a toilet in front left side of the plane that toilet should be marginally bigger as it used to be reserved for scootplus customers once i was sorta told off by the crew for using the toilet before the crew probably embarrassed himself afterwards when i stepped back to my scootplus seat in row 1 on another point about service by the scooties as the cabin crew are called i do notice that there are not much service at all even in scootplus this is probably due to the nature that the food and drinks in scootplus is rationed you will not get more than the one serving of drink that is bundled with your meal perhaps scoot could be more generous to allow additional drink service for scootplus passengers thereby creating halo effect for better customer satisfaction  scoot is bloody awful there are better options and very little price difference when flying a full service airline after you calculate all the add ons and wouldo not gets with scoot it is not cheap just nasty  try congo airways your right josh with scoot a guest of size who are unable to put both arm rests down must buy two seats together or pay for the premium cabin great to see you flying with one of your supporters well done josh and adrian can not wait to see the afghan angels incredible crew i hope they fly again soon  great video josh was extremely surprised tbh  does scoot still play enjoy the silence as boarding music  props to adrian for taking the hit for us patrons no seriously you did a great job and as always thanks josh for keeping us all informed  looks like you had a retort meal josh  well electricity does cost money to generate but something like a plane train bus or ship is generating it anyhow as a byproduct so it does seem very strange to charge passengers for it and the electrical drain for charging phones etc would be very small not like you are plugging in a fan heater or a toaster  sound was not great on this one sorry hello josh i have just subscribed to your channel your videos are great fun to watch thank you  question have you ever flown with klm dutch airline whoops i wrote this before watching this video looking forward to watching your klm review greetings from durban south africa   2 30 in my opinion you are defintily wrong may i ask you if you wanna sit next to a person which is taking half of your seat for me this would be a desaster and would make me angry to this person also the airline is bruning approx 2x more fuel than a normal person  so great to have one of your pateron supporters on board with you and chatting like old friends adrian and josh both looked like they had fun even with hiccups in train strikes etc i always like watching josh as much for his airline review but more for his genuine and fun personality scoot looked like a nice airline and a cool touch with the refreshing welcome drink i love their motto sit back relax escape the ordinary it works as a good motto for life shame about the food it did not look appetising and sorry it gave you a bit of a stomach pain i do not know if it is me but josh seems to stay young i watched a video from 4 years ago and he looked exactly the same in 4 years i look so old by comparison would not mind a video on his diet or health regime at some point hahahah seriously though great job and another well spent time on youtube  that afghanistan video sounds amazing really looking forward to that  scoot really shot themselves in the foot by combining both flights now there is a travel bubble between singapore amp germany and fully vaccinated passengers no longer have to quarantine in sin on arrival except this scoot flight from berlin because it stops in ath obviously people will take the fully greenlighted singapore air amp lufthansa flights from fra amp muc and not this one i wonder if scoot will change anything or continue to miss out on the travel bubble traffic as for you amp your chatty friend booking them in biz why oh why economy sells for less than half and is perfectly fine for that 2 5 hrs flight  i flew it mel bkk a couple of years ago and hated it terrible food just microwaved mush crew otherwise disappeared until the seatbelt light came on when they would charge through waking everyone up regardless of whether they had their belt on the other way i flew malindo premium and it was great  please visit bangladesh to dubai  beats me why countries give away their fifth freedom rights  it is a budget airline attentive crew   i look forward to seeing your update video about the all female afghanistan crew  sounds really weird flying scoot within europe lol josh by the way i think i haven t seen any ber review by you are you planning to make one cheers great work  how is that business class  really convinced by scoot flew the route in scoot plus two weeks ago by myself with a private jet feeling included would love to go on a longer flight to singapore with them one day  i request you to update how to fly abroad in this pandemic happens i also want to fly away without being made me stay in small room for 2weeks how many passengers were on board less than20  granted this is a low cost carrier but 200 euros for a two and a half hour flight in europe on a widebody and not in a standard european 3 3 business class on a narrow body is not bad at all i would choose this over any european legacy carrier any day of the week for a short hop intra european  scoot has always been rubbish my scoot flying experience remains to be one of the worst i have had and i do a bit of flying because of my job the airline seems to be intent on maximizing revenue per passenger the flight crew is a terrible batch of very possibly singapore airline rejects  shorts are bad for travelling  not expecting anything of quality in a no frills but you get too little for what you pay compared to lccs from neighboring countries its due to singapore having expensive labor compared to elsewhere in the region for intra europe flights i would rather take ryanair and pay 5 times less so someone basically sitting on your lap the whole flight because they are morbidly overweight does not violate any laws i am glad somebody had the courage to stand up for us normal passengers who have to endure hours of inconvenience because someone has no self control  always handsome    hi josh another great flight review i have flown singapore al a few times and found the service fantastic so i was quite surprised to see scoot was somewhat less glad you do the toilet reviews i am already looking forward to you next trip report  nice content love the content josh keep it up i cannot address the legalities i have no legal training but as a fat person myself i recognise that there are limits the comfort of my neighbour needs to be considered however they should give some idea of size limits if they are going to insist on two seats for fat people so what is the maximum waist size they will accommodate they should tell me how much weight i need to lose to travel with them thank you for the video  i did not know scoot was flying there usually with food if is smells funny i wont eat it never in my life even having an asian mother or visiting most south east asian countries including singapore have i ever heard of oriental treasure rice i know of 8 treasure rice which is a gluttonous rice and coconut milk based asian rice pudding dessert which is actually very yummy but not oriental treasure rice looks like its got shitake mushrooms lap cheong pork sausage chicken soya sauce and rice to be honest i would give that a pass and have the sweeter treasure rice dessert anytime  can i have the mushrooms please josh  14th in line  hello dear 94   i have heard that nonstop dan had an awful experience with scoot and will never fly with them i do not know about your thoughts regarding this situation anyways i trust your reviews more and keep it up  hi adrien interesting route never been on a fifth freedom flight great video as always josh  scoot is what prison feels like  my right ear enjoyed the video  hi josh the audio is having a bug where the right channel is only working for your mic audio it is clear while using headphone where there is no audio at left channel try nook scoot btwn delhi bangkok its the most horrible thing i ever flew in moulds hanging from the air vents amenities u get is 100ml water stained carpets torn seats absolute disgusting  hi josh hope your good actually this made my day thanks and keep making like this videos and stay blessed and stay safe  third  i am second coz everyone is first second bro follow me for daily updates on  see you over there  first yep  wht about main luggage is that included in the fare or have to pay extra for it in scoot airlines  do they weigh your luggages  did they have your meal choices  you need a mic near your mouth as we can not hear you above the noise of the engines  jewel is amazing  haa i think scoot is both low price and low quality  it makes perfect sense to not sell you bottle water after security so you spend your money inflight  i had the same problem with purchasing on scoot turned out they would only accept a credit card not a visa mastercard debit card  everyone is particularly bashing scoot you probably have an extremely high standard you can not approach full service and lcc with the same standards fly scoot and compare against spirit then you might not complain so much or against jetblue jetblue is at least a higher quality lcc what you are willing to fork out that is exactly what you get  you wont catch me on any boeing dreamliner or max regardless of which airline are operating them after the chief safety engineer of boeing for 30yrs now retired said that those aircraft are not safe because of shortcuts in manufacture which can lead to catastrophic failure amp recommend people not to fly in those aircraft yes many airlines still use those planes does that make them safe personally i would trust the chief safety engineer whose calls to fix the problems went unheeded  terminal 1 is such a mess head over to terminal 3 and you will appreciate the large open floor space with multitudes of working spaces and shops that sell food amp beverage  another issue with scoot is that there is no flight connection you need to wait to collect your luggage from the previous flight and recheck in again in the next flight make sure you have at least 3 4 hours layover plus your visa to singapore if your are not fast enough you may miss the next flight this is a hidden feature when flying with scoot after considerations i gave up and booked regular flights its is not too expensive at all also scoot charged every little things onboard and with minimum services this is the same principle used by air asia and vietjetair  scoot i think got mix reviews ah sometimes i see always flight delay i never taken before thanks for sharing no issues with there being no tv screen on board but any adapters or usb charger slots available on board  do not fly scoot if you value yourself this airline lost my trench coat which was in the checked in luggage and refused to compensate for the loss what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating the same bs again and again  amax in spore has already gone down hill for the last 20 year visa master is the play safe way  there is actually a lot of seats area in singapore airport very comfortable to work maybe you missed it there should be a water dispenser after the security check the reason to makes the security check at the gate are so that everyone got more time to shop and enjoy the facilities that changi airport can offer that is totally make sense if you are flying a normal airline you will not need to buy water as you could just get it from the cabin crew and if you are flying with a budget airlines they depend you to purchase water and food onboard for profit so it totally make sense ya  welcome to the philippines  airasia is better than scoot but sia is full service is one of the best in the world sia top two airlines in the world full service airasia top budget airline for 14 years  brilliant review although having watched other scoot reviews i think you dodged a bullet with the food  so glad you are back i get withdrawal symptoms when i do not get a daily update video enjoy the philippines and keep safe x glad you have a decent enough experience enjoy the philippines   2 48 breathing   this flight attendant chief speak very not undestandable english she is gorgeous happy but how people can undestand  oh no sam is crazy put himself in this situation too tired i flew on scoot to  is not that a humbling experience for you  awesome i would love to meet you at the singapore airshow in a few weeks i will be there awesome and informative video of your crew experience at scoot sam you have a lovely personality i am a pilot here in amman and would love to work for scoot someday  blessings  it really sucks they do not fly to cambodia  i swear i will never buy airline tickets from this airline again and will warn you not to believe their advertisements they told me that i bought the tickets online so they would not be responsible for my tickets at all so why do they still sell tickets online  thank you very much for this wonderful video we hope to dedicate a video in order to solve the problems that occur in many airlines in america canada europe and various countries when a person is very advised and influences the person on his side here is the problem the people who advise must pay the amount for two seats so that they do not crowd others we are facing this problem this problem must be solved in fact all companies think only for the sake of money not for the sake of human comfort and this is what we see and this is considered a big mistake and planes that transport passengers must be well maintained for the safety of aviation and for the safety of society many accidents have occurred and the reason is a lack of maintenance and this is considered very important the danger of companies only thinking about how to collect money they did not look at the safety of society they did not look at the safety of the plane especially the maintenance maintenance is important especially the engines and all the equipment during my trip in america the flying was very not good in terms of food and in terms of cleanliness an international law must be put in place in terms of cleanliness and in terms of treatment as well as maintenance the plane is for the safety of people can you do zipair i saw some post on reddit complaining about this flight and how obnoxious and invasive samchui was this is very hard job      i want to go to sg but i am afraid to fly because of turbulent  i am waiting for you i have arrived come on come on thank you i

plane on flightradar24 try flying ryanair wizz air and cebu pacific and zipair this is so refreshing seeing how it really work what about vietnam airline  if i were on that flight i would be keeping everything that sam served me for souvenirs love it sam how you made serving very personalized by knowing their names  seats quality and how talking to passengers really could help to improve flight experience thank you especially for opening our eyes how tuff stewardess working to serve us well done team scoot  hi sam thanks for show the scoot and i would like to try it for my next travel to sydney to visit my family  scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money  shocking but no tv why  sam you have such a wonderful life flying on the best and worst airlines and telling us about your experiences fascinating vlogs thank you for sharing  the flight would have been better without him bro is saying it is hard just because he is fat i flew on scoot from sabah malaysia to singapore the flight attendants was amazing the pilots were very experienced to butter the landing the quality from economy class is surprisingly good if u need help they are always there with every answer  i see that scoot pok mon airplane and i like pok mon cards  what a refreshing way to capture your flight experience from a crew is pov sam  do this again  tanks sam all respects to you you got game putting yourself out going all in and doing the job well  capt ian is the pilot i hope to get everytime i fly have flown over a hundred times and can tell he has mastered his craft  was it fun filming passengers faces without their consent  the worst lcc in asia but you did well sam you did well  i saw some qatar airways flight attendants behind you ok i just flew scoot like 2 months ago from singapore to china and were second class but also no tv but i still like the view but until when i watch this vid it was actually scoot and singapore airlines are from singapore good job sam  pokemon gotta catch em all wow very nice flight good job sir sam  i flew with scoot from bali berlin it was nice experience  very interesting vlog sam what a cool experience for you sam and a totally different video content as well loved the fact that you were able to show how hard the crew works as well great job as always  how about kenya airways the pride of africa this is one of the best sam chui is videos  scoot is shit airlines bad experience rude flight attendants of course they are nice with you sam this suits you far more than being a pilot sam sorry just being real  dude this is the reality of the hard working flight attendants okkkuuuuurrrrr i have never heard of this airline i am very impressed i would definitely choose them given the opportunity i flew across the us two days several mishaps occurred but of course that is no reason to behave poorly i like to believe everyone is doing their best finally arrived at my destination many many hours later than expected but i am alive hahaha we had to abort the landing due to wind turbulence from the plane taking off in front of us i woke the other passengers up shouting oh shit oh shit as i watched the wings wobble dramatically fun times i was on a united flight and they gave us free food to make up for all the nonsense so that was nice of them hopefully my red eye back home will be less exciting  a 380  fligh attendants worked none stop scoot flights are rickety the seats need lots of changing uncomfortable lots of peeling but the crew 10 10 really great service professional and kind crew  i loved flying scoot and have done for the last 10 years they have lost my favour now since they are suspending the singapore gold coast route as of july i had to get refunded for 2 of my trips i had already booked for after july very disappointed with scoot and will not fly sa either out of principle i had flow gold coast to thailand return on scoot 7 times in the last 13 months  welcome to melbourne i will be honest scoot is actually a good flight i have always had a really good experience with them i went on scoot last month and came back with singapore airlines because scoot airlines is horrible i went from melbourne to singapore about 7 hours it was the worst flight ever everyone on board were complaining too saying they would never fly with scoot again there was no aircon at all and on that day it was boiling also which airline does not give you water unless you pay 4 us dollars water has always been free and the water they give you is such a small amount for 4 us dollars that your still thirsty afterwards their food was horrible too and of course the crew members were very rude they had a rude attitude and if you would press the flight attendant light they would take ages to come honestly i would never fly it again and i wish i knew before flying because that was suppose to be one of the best trips of my life  sam you somehow convinced me to book with scoot in my next flight lovely everything those smiles are infectious genuine sam you somehow convinced me to book with scoot in my next flight lovely everything those smiles are infectious genuine pov the airplane when they are doing the exercise airplane crashes i always feel very emotional when plane take off and land is this a norm  flying scoot soon for the 1st time excited scoot are not as good as they use to be prior to the pandemic their luggage prices are criminal now and the service is not as you show in this video they have really dropped in quality and standards how come you no need to wear mask when serving the passengers  hi sam very dissapointed to your review as your review are no longer geniune but just another paid advertisement  scoot flight usually do not maintain their cabin well  the 3 35 show no exit light on carpet  hi sam very dissapointed to your review as your review are no longer geniune but just another paid advertisement  3 35 the carpet do not have exit light hi sam very dissapointed to your review as your review are no longer geniune but just another paid advertisement  hi sam i really dissapointed your review as it merely just had become another paid advertisement  you must be kidding me scoot is definately overprice and their staffs are sucks plane is not well clean and many interior are broken and not repaired  i fly to vietnam with scoot and it was amazing i like that the crew was so kind  god i would suck as any service people thank god i work as a camp instructor i can be more abrasive and they do not mind as much instead sia should really improve their meals amp services during my flight from sin to pek standard has

watch i would love to see more videos like this  i like this type of video have some more please  thanks enjoyable video  what no entertainment now that it is more interesting to watch review videos not because of sponsors it is best to start making honest videos without being tied to sponsors love this episode scoot is my favourite low cost airline i am planning to fly per to sin with scoot soon but i would not expect to see sam on a scoot flight he only flies in first class suites does not he  not easy job at  sam you should become a flight attendant  woah that looks soo fun  hi sam when are you going back to test the chinese airlines if possible the c919 keep up the good jobs love your videos  thanks a lot sir for making me so happy with this lovely video i love all the crew i sincerely love scoot airline the crew are fantastic i feel like returning back to cabin to fly as a crew thats cool ideally you get better seats at scootplus i flew sin syd in early march 23 and got a seat totally torn and pasted with masking tape no fault of the crew but no service recovery other than a blanket when i lodged a complaint they said they are looking at it after 1 5 months they are still looking at it very poor service recovery i wish i could post a pic here you will be shocked with the condition of the seat i am still waiting for their decision  what a fun video they all work hard  sam chui and your friends my best wishes    another great video sam what an opportunity for you to be a crewmember for a day so many of us are unfamiliar with scoot and their operation but thanks to you and this channel i would be very much inclined to book with scoot their service and product along with passenger testimonials seals the deal for me thank you again for what you are doing for aviation  nbc new hit show air pprentice  hello sam hope you enjoyed the experience how i wish we could all experience all that you did looking forward to more videos like this  cheers  one day i wanna be a pilot  wow  i want to try scoot next time   interesting i am usually a bit sceptical when it comes to long haul and budget airlines but scoot seems to be a real alternative that you can try out even though you do not normally fly budget  can i be an airpprentice for a day too  totally love this video and to the crews who work hard to made the flight really fun with happiness thanks sam for sharing this video superb mister  happy ied mubarak 2023 love your enthusiasm for travel on aircraft keep up the excellent work my man  i fly from berlin to singapore this is my first time with scoot and the last time they hunting low cost traverel for cheap price but unfortunetly the fly ticket not include anything also they not allow you brig your own food or dring onboard so you must all from over priced menu when i caluculate all after fly its the same price like fly with qatar with full servis include teribble experience with scoot  welcome to melbourne sam we flew over from singapore on the pikachu jet on the 11th and returned on the 27th  sadly scoot are ceasing flights to the gold coast here in queensland australia in june did i hear correctly 372 passengers on a 787  when onboard malaysia airlines again  what an experience sam thanks for bringing us onboard to give us viewers a better insight kudos to all the hardworking scoot crew really looking forward to my scoot flight to hong kong real soon now  remembers me about a video firefly made about 9 years ago when a famous malaysian actor undercover as a flight attendant the best review ever thanks sam chui great job sam glad you can experience flying from a different point of view  love it sam  next time from the flightdeck please  the video is really good only mr sam chui can be given privileges like this this is truly a top notch youtuber from this video we will know what to do before flying and during the flight turns out being a flight attendant is not easy sam that was a great show the boss lady is so beautiful  wow i saw this flight land scoot serisouly need to improve their meal offerings i do not mind paying for influght meals on a lowco airline but paying that price and getting something barely edible is an insult airasia is much better in this regard their food is no gourmet either but at least it is decent tasting and reasonably priced given the choice i would pick d7 over tr  a really well presented high quality informative production good promo for scoot  scoot is funniest airlines  very nice of scoot to give you thr opportunity to experience the work they do kudos used them heaps no worries at all not much support if flight cancelled but it is lo cost so fair enough bit annoying no headphones allowed during taxi cos no screens i guess you are very friendly and lovely guy  wish i could be like you your an aviation expert and top gun i am not a fan of sam chui as there is always a personal agenda hidden somewhere i will pass watching this self fulfilling prophecy of his  i am happy to see a lot of sikh people in this video yesterday i was at changi airport t1 viewing mall for plane spotting  excellent sam servant does not suit you bro what is your plan in mel interested in some plane spotting  when sam stands at the cabin door he looks more like a bouncer with a smile  perfect video   this video is good but how did he get from indonesia all the way to australia and then singapore in a single month hi sam that was a great videom i realy enjoyed it great show  nice bro  hello mr cui why is station b not updated now  great video as always sam  almost reminds me of how westjet used to be in its infancy borderline cringe y but it is a budget airline i would love to see more behind the scene airline things like this  does he get paid doing all this  i flew from singapore to sdyney on scoot to was a 777 200 really choice airline a few years ago  no matter how much scoot costs it is definitely worth it what a master piece film sam  my high respects to flight attendances air crews all the peoples behind the screen in aviation industries kudos to all of them salute to scoot airline looks like they are having a better service standard now looks like everything is better coz always remember that scoot is only a budget airline not a full service one keep it up scoot airline and last but not least as always thank you for a five star footage sam terimakasih dan semangat selalu  fantastic vlog i wish they had scoot flights to the us thanks sam as always and the people at scoot were wonderful hosts too  this is so interesting and something new thanks for the tips and looking forward to take scoot infuture woohoo  best budget airline  great to see how you look after customer quality service equipment i flew on scoot from sydney to singapore their service levels were on par or better than a full service carrier one of the crew saw that my 8 year old daughter was fascinated by what they were doing so they asked if they could take her out to the galley and give her a bit of a tour after 30 minutes went by i got up to go and find her only to discover 4 of the crew doing her hair to match theirs before they got her to help out as though she was part of the team next minute she is walking down the aisle being helpful she was so happy and the crew were genuinely spectacular that was years ago now and she still talks about it  you are inspirational sam i would just love to try being cabin crew for a day i think being cabin crew on a low cost airline is much more demanding than full service  what an idea a good way to give people some new experience in aviation industry  sam what can i say but good on you for putting yourself out there on the receiving end this video albeit choreographed does give a good insight into what goes on behind the scene hopefully passengers understand and appreciate this when they next fly thank you  every time i see your video i envy your job in particular today is video was very interesting thank you for your hard work i would never fly with them again i flew with them from london gatwick to bangkok flight crew looked like they just come out of school not even a blanket for a night flight no usb ports nothing and was not cheap this might be my favorite yet sam love all the behind the scenes looks and the conversation with the captain  i hope you do lots more of these videos behind the scenes is so interesting we as passengers do not see great vid my best from yul another great video amp superb insight into all the effort and hard the work the crew experience all airlines ofcourse whilst also keeping a positive amp friendly face you also actually started to feel tired in a short space of time the pilots crew all looked welcoming any feedback from the scoot is customer taking singapore laksa  how are you doing  sam a awesome youtube footage we enjoyed it tremendously thanks my friend  probably your best video sam loved seeing you get to work this was a fresh perspective that your other videos do not have respect for the scoot team they are working hard  last month was the first time i travel abroad in my life out of malaysia because i am no rich people when i flew to melbourne using scoot it will always hold a special place in my heart because it was really the first time in my life to flew inside other airlines aside from malaysia airlines and airasia here is to flying more  i enjoyed this video sam  that was a great addition sam but my only trouble budget airlines should not ask passengers to pay for the food service it should be provided and delivered to the passenger is seat but this is a budget airline for short haul flights scoot is different and the crew is wonderful including the senior staff congratulations sam you did well you need to work on your landings though namaste brother  hey sam awesome flight and loved the flight attendant ms bubu bless her heart and do you think at some point you may pursue the commercial pilot is license after sampling the 787 via their flight simulator very very nice please keep coming out with more vlogs    we are flying scoot in a few months time from australia to singapore i read complaints online but most seem quite minor cost of water which does seem excessive also cost of charging devices food quality anyway it is a budget airline with good aircraft so i think we will survive  excellent sam a flight attendant is life seems so glamorous but here we see it is hard work and i have much better insight thank you  he is doing it for a low cost airline when are u coming back to trinity and give us a speech  bubu is a pro and great teacher i am sure flying with sam chui would be fun however this makes total sense it is scoot flew them last year singapore macau round trip as a subsidiary of the normally excellent and full service singapore airlines scoot could not be more the polar opposite we had only about 25 30 passengers when i flew last spring under tight covid restrictions as there is only one class economy on these flights i paid a little extra to get an aisle seat on an emergency row i do this regularly on air sia upon entering the aircraft in singapore i noticed something strange immediately many people crammed in the back of the aircraft why i sat down in my seat and buckled up however it was not until after the aircraft began to taxi i realized the reasons i was not seated in an economy plus seat but why i had paid for it  i inquired with the flight attendant turns out they had switched aircraft type after i bought my ticket since covid meant fewer passengers the passengers crammed in the back those seats no longer existed on the smaller aircraft they had not bothered to adjust any seating finally they moved me to a economy plus seat after the meal but it took way to long and they seemed to be arguing about whether to even do that as directed i filed a complaint online with the airline but they never bothered to even respond  another thing scoot operates completely independent of singapore air when connecting do not expect singapore air to help in any way it is like scoot is kryptonite arriving in macau we found out that seating was important in regards to covid protocols we were immediately isolated and tested and one passenger had covid so there was added scrutiny around seating assignments then we started our crazy two weeks of hotel quarantine but scoot it was virtually the only way in or out of macau at the time without quarantining in yet another country first  glad sam enjoyed his flight but i will not be joining him but it is like cheap scoot to promote their airline by hiring sam for one day  another awesome video sam thank you  you are really funny sam i enjoy your vlogs so much it is a complete entertainment package  so cool of scoot to allow you to experience this  i appreciate for your video i know that every work is not easy but i do not expect flight attendants this more difficult thank you for your work to all flight attendants to remind all passengers we are guests to their house once on a plane so be patients polite and kind to the house owners and guests on the plane that like you do not forget be safe and use seat belt once required  a good one sam i would not be surprised if you want to become a licensed pilot one day ah but you can not be bothered with too much work  my review hi sam i met you at clutter park last time you were there this video is incredible the audio is loud and level and clear and perfect from start to finish everyone has excellent audio the multiple cameras was great from the cams in the kitchen to inside and outside the simulator cams in the cockpit watching the crew and cams watching the runway and landing and controls cams in the cabin with many different angles incredible editing and transitions the flight crew speaking with you like you were a co worker and friend this was like a hollywood production i loved the humanity of it all i felt connected to the staff and the flight the feelings and emotions you expressed while working from fun to tired to sore back very human and real with a live shoot like this there is no way to script this but it was perfect from start to finish the pr gained from this video will be powerful anyone watching this video would want to fly singapore you made them proud the warmth and kindness and stunning beauty of the staff really comes through i felt appreciation and a connection to all the flight crew this was impressive and professional  nothing self serving or ego about this just darn good production and a video of perfection now i understand why doors open for you and you are given the access you get thanks for sharing this with the viewers thank you flight crew and singapore airlines   03 11 cute couple when is the wedding   great video  this was awesome thanks for sharing this sam  no comment  scoot is pretty good the check in staff see i am not good on the kiosk but as always scoot staff see this and come and help the cabin crew make you feel so comfortable and at ease the food is still a bit ordinary though have a couple flights coming up in may so look forward to it they do it tough up there and passengers should appreciate them more  god bless you for your stream  love the content sam great video sam  nice work  thank you sam   always innovative topics sam great job what a great airline scoot is next time i am in australia i will certainly give scoot a try thanks sam very entertaining video  great video   love it very interesting thanks sam is slimer looking great  what an amazing experience and to try the flight simulator these people do a fantastic job under all kinds of circumstances you lived it firsthand kudos to you you pulled it off very well and i learned something too pre order your meal  went to melbourne last year in november and i did get the pokemon 787 in my lens   love the pikachu plane amazing crew  today was my first flight after 3 years this is different sam brings us an little look in to what aviation work is like as a cabin crew very cool  the crew briefing was so interesting  the pursur bubu seems a amazing women anyone has her instagram  what a fun video to watch thanks for an inside view of what the flight attendants duties are  o 0 sam in scoot yo i flew scoot sam better then the smart local scoot has no entertainment and music please tell them  lovely sam what a different experience it has been not only for you but us also as viewers thank you for the video  sam i would like to thank you and scoot for showing us what really happens on an airline maybe more people if they saw avideo like this hopefully understand and be more willing to not be mean to the staff on the airplane  scoot your marketing team nailed it fabulous video well done   omg bubu looks hottt   hello sam your best video  vari nice israel hopefully wish to see as an air pprentice at singapore airlines too  good job sam  happy easter just by the looks of it scoot is ey food offering looks much better than sq is recent food takeaway box ey meals  hi mr jet lag this is sooooooooo much better than an advertisement campign for an airline sam just boosted sales for the airline asiana should have done this before the pandemic and avoid the merger with korean  think you did a fantastic job love seeing things from a different perspective thanks  well done very useful one fantastic scoot air gd one can recommend  who is holding your camera  the iscoot experience part was cringey passengers getting up to fake dance with the crew good lord  great video sam always informative  want to see sam as air pprentice on biman bangladesh airlines  very nice experience   i certainly gained a greater appreciation for flight attendants on these long haul flights they work hard fill many responsibilities it seems exhausting and they need to smile through it all the lead flight attendant bubu really showed professionalism throughout  372 seats in an 787 omg  what a great experience and i know you had a good time  to be honest this time i took scoot airways back to mainland china from indonesia no matter the transit terminal the oldest t1 the working attitude of the ground staff and the professionalism of the ground staff and the crew i was completely disappointed the complaint email was sent on march 30 as of today 23 days have passed and there is no feedback i advise everyone to avoid low cost airlines if possible if it is unavoidable choose the two flights with the shortest layover time even though scoot is a company owned by singapore airlines it is still a low cost airline and cannot provide even the most basic services moreover singapore t1 is really old small and impersonal  rubbish airline i will never fly with them again ever it seems like sq send all their rejects there and do a how not to run an airline demo  well scoot is my favourite because powered by singapore airlines great video scoot is good it does not feel like a budget airline i have flown twice on scoot to tokyo and on both flights the toilets were very clean  thank you very much sam chui for this video  very interactive video when u realize asian low cost airlines have better service than us legacy airlines all bloody indians  nice bright yellow shirt sam good stuff and yellow polo definitely looks better on you than a sarang kebaya  awesome video sami will use scoot next time they seem like a very good airline to travel with and the staff seem super nice and friendly keep up the good work   very nice video love seeing all the hard work the fa is do what a fun vlog sam  i wish i could be your seat mate on any flight because it would a barrel of laughs and the nervous flyer in me will not feel scared it is always nice to dream   cozy video  wow i never knew there is so much going on behind the scenes of a safe flight and btw the b 787 simulator is super cool thanks for sharing sam  i am a singaporean very glad you flown with scoot and even as an apprentice honestly scoot is not as bad as what most people portray them to be great video sam  sam this video tops all others you never cease to surprise and i was smiling watching it   congrats   love this vlog so much sam you did great thanks for this fabulous video   hey sam you

perspective  i flew ewr to sin on singapore airlines are the crew were amazing i do not know how the females wear the flats for 19 hours i am curious what the food is like on scoot from cebu to

mister san chui do not forget to visit my country timor leste fa is are rock stars  maybe more people should watch this to appreciate the difficulty of their job  awesome sam to see the other side of the story nice to see all the work that crews put into every flight  maybe one day he will be the pilot  this must be the friendliest airline company to allow sam be a cabin crew for a day i bet other airlines would take filming as a cabin crew life very seriously another great video sam just do not give up your day job  awesome  please take me along with u on such lovely trips wow thanks for making them smile on six hours flight what a wonderful experience awesome  she should have said you crossed my expectations you have to cross to exceed  wow air pprentice  this apprentice experience

your family good morning humility is the most beautiful part of our life a wise person never argues with his obstacles he simply circumvents them this thought perfectly defines you sam chu yu are the best what you propose to do  what a great experience fun to watch  oh sam i loved this video you make me miss my job flying for south african airways so so much pity greedy politicians destroyed my beloved airline i loved the energy and vibe of the crew being cabin crew is awesome and comes with great responsibility you did an amazing job  it looks like i want to fly with scoot air to singapore i want to feel the ambience  super cool to watch this loved this video sam excellent work  787th like  lovely video and enjoyable good team work and kudos to you sam and everyone involved sending you greetings from toronto    is not the scoot pilot the one in your video of the delivery flight of singapore airlines 787 10  372 passengers in a tight 787 9 uuuh not for me  lk 882 aviation lover hi sam i am from india more like this please seems like a sponsored video this video recall my memory scoot airline my 1st time fly with this airline from singapore to haikou on 20171212 that time was flight with airbus 320  great video so different great idea to do this sam you found a new career waiting for your giveaway results of 23rd april you were such a good sport this video is particularly interesting especially to see you play a different role the options in the first question were too simple haha thanks for making such good content i can see it was not easy filming in such a cramped place too  cool experience   mashaallah  singaporean accent is so sexy very interesting thanks sam  very nice  gosh i have no idea you were here else i would have been there to meet you  it is great to see behind the scenes  great video fun and informative much respect to the crew who make our flights as safe and pleasant as they can  i had a smile on my face from the start to the finish of this video terrific idea and very entertaining first class  interesting insights i am wondering if the flight despatchers are trained solely by the airlines on the job or if they have to obtain a certification from national aviation authorities the cabin crew come across really well here scoot i would give them a try  hi sam do you remember me hi sam very good video wow nice flight flyng to be scoot crew want to see sam be an air apprentice in more videos it is interesting to see what happens behind the scene  excellent video what a flight thanks for suchna great experience passengers respect and coperate with the crew they are working hard to make us comfortable  awesome what a dream to try this thanks for sharing your experience sir james in southern california what an amazing video as always  very different and awesome experience indeed sir personally in my time to visit singapore i have never flown with singapore airlines jetstar asia and even scoot but hopefully i will have a chance to fly one of 3 singaporean airlines in the future btw happy eid ul fitr mubarak from indonesia  i have flown with scoot twice and they were fantastic in addition staff at changi airport were also super nice asking me how things were going and did i enjoy my flight all up going to or coming from singapore with scoot is always going to be nice  your so amazing sam much love to you and safe travels oh hi sam i just saw your posts on instagram the outfit looks nice on you tbh hope you havin a nice day  im more into cars and travelling by car but you emit good vibes  pok mon is as a veteran poke go player i would love to fly this airline  great video sam  welcome to singapore sam  hi sam very good video interesting seeing how the crew handles things hope you do more videos like this  omg the crews are very busy great job sam   scoot sucks especially when being forced to use them as a connection on a full price ticket from sia after an all nighter staffed by kids who are obviously cheaper for the payroll  awesome vlog sam thumb up better than jetstar but same same when comes to refunds they make it near impossible to get your money back if you miss the flight or its cancelled singaporean state sponsored fraud credit vouchers expire so its money for nothing for them  nice video sam chui keep up the great content i watched this plane land a few days ago in melbourne  hello samchui why the 747 8 test plane md 11 md 90 boeing 717 airbus a340 200 300 500 was not in the museum fantastic sam  awesome vid  try out air india after tata takeover  thanks for

videos coming how you are not at 50k subscribers by now is beyond me  i really enjoy your videos especially the witty commentary just wish you could would do them more frequently time to become a full time you tuber  when someone mentions snuff in relation to a powder served you know they are top of the game and do not need fancy old fashioned wines and spirits to make a great travel video hope your cat is enjoying the blanket loungy  my missus laughed at me when i pronounced quinoa like you apparently it is pronounced keenwah  another great video your humour is top draw keep the reviews coming   visa form or isg arrival card good video  great watch as always very funny and i am sure you souvenired the cup  why does it not have ife this good plane even jetstar is 787 business class is

india  scoot singapore changing airport i think you have the best job in the world mate  just like economy class not a business class   tunring on the lights  its a watered down pe seat but still a very decent seat for short flights i hate scoot so much if ryanair or easyjet had a380 this is what it would be like  7 08 apparently canberra is a coastal city and brisbane is on fraser island  can you review scoot airline from bangkok dmk tokyo narita  worst airline in the world changed our flight with no notification spent over 20 hours with a mobile and home phone trying to get in contact with someone to no avail they may be cheap but they are also nasty will never fly with them again  can you view a moving map with speed height and all that info on board the scoot app if you purchase the wifi on the 787 cheers scoot airlines how bad is it nice trip report love the 787 the 87 people that disliked this video have no souls they messed up our flights in singapore so we had to book new fligjts with another airline my wife was pregnant and it was on my daughter is birthday they turned their backs towards us and threattened with the police we complained to the main office but there they lied their guts out worst airline ever  yes bye simply aviation and also have fun in singapore   could you do another scoot tripreport on s pore to berlin party mode on 9 34   07 02 the location

buisness class such a waste flight  3 37 i am surprised that people still play that felix why din you take a pic with the stewardess  long haul flights are a great opportunity   how can you called this a business class it just a premium economy class   9 37 omg thd light is rainbow umm hello the name is flyscoot not scoot scoot is bad im foing business class in scoot soon if ryanair were to do long haul flights this is what their planes would be like but with more yellow  very informative nice work  goodbye singapore to berlin started this week  how much is the return ticket  why fly business class if you do not get a proper seat or av where my singaporean friends at  my classmate is on that plane nice review  my hometownnnn singapore if you want a good budget airline business class you should try jetstar  budget airline in asia is never worth it full service airfare can usually be found at similar price is you are willing to have connection  nice can you try flying on eva air it is amazing  good that beautiful airport is taiwan is airport nice flight felix i like the way the lights gradually brighten that is very considerate i just wonder what time did you arrive in singapore and how long was the flight  i think you got the food name wrong  superb video nicely done and no awful music  please other youtube channels take note  hope you did not pay much  looks like premium economy to me  wow felix you really got around in 2017 i am still catching up on your videos scoot is another airline i have never heard of awesome report  lovely video as always  what is the app for this editing video  hey david why are u not uploading any trip report i am very eager to watch it pls can u make a trip report of jet airways b777 economy when is the next news episode that business class should be like renamed to premium economy but i am still ambiguous about this anyway it is really great service by scoot  no business class lounge rip off maybe scoot biz is cheap is that why  superb tripreport  loved it felix would you be able to do a jetstar airways australia review both economy and business classes this business class is about the same than the business class in the 767 or 787 or tui fly belgium but they do transatlantic flights between bru and mia vra or cun for example do you plan a review of tui fly belgium in those plane  awesome video mate  what i want know is how you can afford to even keep flying it must cost you thousands if not hundreds of thousands is it your job as if it is how do i apply as i would love it if it was your job and someday i would love to be part of your team well it is only a dream i have been subscribed for a long time since 20 000 subs come along way may be you will take the time to look at my channel many thanks keiron thumbs up does anybody else take the safety card home  when will you guys be doing an update of the flights you booked for 2018  when are you guys flying air canada  name of the intro song pls answer pls  haii could you explain to us how to update airline tickets from economy class to business class thanks before  nice trip report  could you also do a review of air astana it was not on the list of airlines you have covered or plan to cover soon so i thought i would ask as i have heard some great things  i think you should go vietnam airline you can travel a350 and b787 ect please do a philippine airline trip going to manila plzzzzzzz  nice video nice report but for business class it leaves much to be desired and at least in business class should have ife on the chairs and the chairs they look like premium economy in other airlinres and the food is the same as economy in good airlines companies personally i would not like to fly by scoot  if it is a low cost airline how could they afford a 787 9  what has happend to your website o how long was the flight  love your videos    3 48 smiling doorway  singapore is first language is english btw followed by our mother tongue depending on if youre a malay chinese indian etc fyi the 2 3 2 configuration makes 0 sense if you are buying buisness class you should have direct aisle access  nice video i wish that you will have a good time staying at manila too why do airlines put water into yogurt like containers travel to or from santander airport please awesome review hoped you had enjoyed your visit to singapore and also the experience in the best airport in the world  which is your favourite attraction to visit in singapore so far  great  loving it glad the asian airports finally have the red door green door for customs  nah this is better than shaky camera by your friend    4 29 i thought eva air retired their 747s should try airasia is premium flatbed great video one of the easy workarounds i have seen when there are no ife screens is to issue ipads or equivalent to bc ife can sometimes be a bit glitchy so that is what happened to me on a qf when the ife went down it was actually kind of fun  again and again great videos by david and felix who else agrees can you please film the air serbia business clas airbus a330 belgrade to jfk flew scootbiz in october sin per great value approx gbp220 including the seats you saw in this video a premium meal and alcoholic drink water on boarding and 30kg baggage did not access the entertainment as it looked pretty dire but you can always watch your own would recommend  well as normal i am fucked off do not miss out on any 2018 new year events  what about a flight with azur air germany or with azur air russia they even offer a very old boeing 747 but azur air germany with their 767 300er from d sseldorf to punta cana for example would be also very cool for a tripreport  awesome  david and felix congrats on almost 100k you two are my go to aviation channel thank you for making such amazing videos  did you get some sq miles with this  nice review of scoot felix and i hope you enjoyed your stay in singapore  can you maybe fly royal moroccan airlines you should try to come in mauritius you will like it like anybody who comes it is a paradise in earth  at 4 21 why is there still eva air 747 thought that they phased the queen out honestly looked like a economy trip report  i love 787 is  great report welcome to taiwan i hope i can fly this route with scoot soon  what was the duration of the flight  nice job felix  come to yangon i realize that scoot is the low cost off shoot of singapore airlines that so called business class looks nothing more than premium economy with the meal to match speaking of which if one did not like fish what was the other option if any there is probably a good 40 year difference in our ages so at this stage of the game low cost carriers business class that is not exactly that would not be for me nevertheless i enjoy your videos keep up the good work  go to malaysia im there finally a video featuring felix  do biman london to syhlet please  wtf a dreamliner with no ife   oh yes felix is back again missing david though i have a very awkward question to ask you guys   do you guys ever get diarrhea or stomach aches when you eat this much airplane food  this was in august is felix filming with a gopro  service on scoot business 787 food same as economy legroom width premium economy or short haul business entertainment short haul economy i think it is the same as norwegian is premium class except that foldable seatback tv drinking water in cups now thats not acceptable even for a low cost airline  nice video i would not call this business class its more a premium eco like eurowings or norwegian have it  i just flew scoot boeing 787 last week  its 787 9 dreamliner not 787 8 i just got an ana add do another ana trip report again would why have not ife screen very bad business but so cool video  my mum described her inflight meal with scoot business you seriously paid dollar200 for a pathetic chicken rice what on earth are you thinking  no not a food thumbnail im hungry  btw nice video d it might have been a short stay but hope you had a good time in taiwan  this vid must be old since there is an eva air 747 at 4 26  this video made my day thank you to the gate or the lounge i am rabbit singh i am 9 years old and i want to make a youtube channel this is my grandmother mobile scoot seems like a pretty good airline   when will the trip report on singapore airlines be released  nice flight maybe you should take the next one to poland hope you had a great time in singapore d awesome besides you guys should definitely try the airasia x premium flatbed  i am pleasure that you like the beauty and tidy of taoyuan airport thank you for coming to taiwan i had waited for this report for long time i hope you guys could try eva air or china airlines to tpe not far in the future  great i have always wondered how good the product is on the long haul lcc is you should really try eva air i took it from los angeles to taipei and back also took it from taipei to manila and back amazing experience even for economy but scoot still looks good nice  hola finally a decent review of scoot ridiculous to call this business class  i was wondering if your going to use scoot and the first time i used an 787 was just very awsome and amazing just jokking hi i qm the first one to see this finally my country is airline but sry no screen flatbed etc welcome to taipei taiwan  they already fly since summer in athens greece with 787 i think the service is quite good in business class for budget airlines like scott thank you for upload enjoyable flight food looked tasty  philippines pls   could you do ana tripreport again because ana is haunting the ad of this channel  not first but you are my favourite looks more like an premium eco  another great report makes me happy an airport bus ride at singapore is extremely rare   simlyaviation u are my favorite youtuber  if you want the chinese words here is the sentence thank you for flying with me from taipei to

here so early before 100 views  awesome tripreport  firsttt d keep up the great work my fave airline and my fave class i rlly like you simply aviation i have subscribed yo your channel from the start  awesome tripreport 50  48th do another flight to manchester plz 18th view cool tripreport  love the video try air india from vienna  first no first great video did the cabin crew locked the windows dimmer  this scoot flight actually received a bomb treat but there is nothing a few days ago the aircraft had to be followed with a singapore air force jet and landed back at singapore yes the route is still the same  scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money  i have flown scoot from sin to ath and it was very pleasant not torturous at all also not a huge amount of legroom but it was okay as i was on an sq codehare ticket i had free meals and was allowed to keep the blanket as a souvenir scoot is my favourite low cost airline  experienced scoot flights manila to sg to gold coast au ages ago on a return trip then singapore to manila last january all nice  brilliant video mate great video always been curious about scoot  nice trip report  have a safe journey  have a safe trip i was also planning to go australia can i find out which amex card did you access the lounge with  sorry i just uploaded it again because i had to self isolate guys after catching covid hehe anyway for those who want to go abroad check the description for the 400 thousand promo code  it is similar to klia airport are the bags in cabin baggage weighed sis  sis are the provisions for suitcases strict because the scoot is speed is 54 while my suitcase is 55 is the handcarry weighed  when will indonesian airlines have the boeing 787 dreamliner  sis where is the scooter counter at ngurah rai airport and how do you check in online independently or directly at the airport  sorry i just watched the video if you want to review things like food it is better to know what you are reviewing nasi lemak with chili paste this might give you the wrong answer for those who have not been on a scoot plane or other planes ok  scoot flight fuck    what brand is that luggage  i took a scoot from jeddah transiting singapore then to jakarta which was really nice but took a long time  sir when ordering prebooked food or in flight can you bring your own bread  my suitcase was lost on the scooter 5 months ago until now no news called emailed no answer i have entered mr consumer media and reported it to the ministry of transportation bro is it expensive to buy food at scoot about how much does it cost  i have never used the plane toilet ever since cause alley narrow and long queue  bro how much is 20kg baggage on a scoot because it is not included as baggage right  when do you want to go on a trip with mas wira because if you go there yourself you are confused and do not know how haha   i am not afraid of leaving the country bro i am afraid i will not have the money hehehhe great bro cool always healthy greetings i will never use scoot again terrible airline oh my gosh baaang bro trip to alpa mart bae bro very interesting video sorry to ask is there a check at bali airport for those who have not been vaccinated i have just had my second vaccine and i plan to have a flight to jakarta from bali previously i had a pcr test from medan to bali transiting in jakarta but i was not even checked thank you in advance for the answer i do not think it is like kuala namu it is better if kuala namu has a train to medan city it is big not chaotic the building has a nice waiting room and there is not a lot of clutter  according to q even though it is considered economical landing amp scoot is take off is smoother than singapore airline is  is not the cabin crew friendly bro  sir does the ticket include baggage if you take a scoot  the interior of the scoot is really not that great even though his son is sq he does not have an elegant impression at all at least it is still better if the qg looks like the interior and cabin crew are still connected to the ga  bro where did you buy the suitcase  the roof looks like the west java international airport bro in kertajati try flying to kertajati airport it is definitely quiet  bro i want to ask there are no special rules for going to singapore now for example what kind of documents do you have to have is it as free as it was before covid  bang cobain ryan air dong how much is a ticket from bali to singapore by scoot bang well done bro  always healthy and successful nice video  that is great bro it is just appeared right  sorry i just uploaded it again because i had to self isolate guys after catching covid hehe anyway for those who want to go abroad check the description for the 400 thousand promo code  it is really exciting every day i wait for the new one to finally arrive watching vlogs you always skip to the eating part bro bro is there really ham in it  my friend turned vegan because he ate the wrong meat  yesterday on the singapore surabaya route i took a scoot the service was really good hopefully i can catch up with mas wira amen p catix good afternoon all thank you for sharing  moderate lol smh is the turbulence towards the end of the flight or in the middle or is there constant turbulence throughout the flight sorry nervous flier here can not stand over talkative passengers nice video mate just two questions which hotel did you stay in singapore and what area also did scoot offer you an upgrade to scoot plus via email or when checking in and if so how much extra was the upgrade that was an expensivie return flight to aus probably could have bought a return ticket with qantas for that much and gained qff points as well jetstar also flies from melbourne to singapore since scoot do not fly there perhaps worth a try next time  great video interestingly the online prices as add ons for the meals shown on your scoot cafe menu are auddollar19 00 i do not think sgddollar12 00 converts to auddollar19 00 something is out of whack or they have a currency conversion that rivals paypal is did you use the fancy new check in kiosks at changi  does this kind of turbulance only shake or do they also drop i am afraid of the dropping feeling had once sudden drop when i took jetstar hey may i know how is the leg room of it  nice one thanks for sharing i am very keen to try scoot between sydney and singapore hopefully sometime next year so many places to visit just not enough holidays away from work it is a bit annoying when they control the tint on the windows  i have not flew whit scoot yet changi is world best air port is my opiniun great work nice video bro  you chose well flying on the day service i cannot imagine doing this on a red eye yes scoot charges you for everything except the air you breathe personally i think the best value lcc is still air asia because you are paying everything in myr which is so damn cheap especially your meals hahahaha i am glad the crew were jovial nothing better than that to set the tone i love bumpy flights and seated at the end tip your experience is actually multiplied with the plane bending etc its fun it looks like the airline has grown kinder the lay overs it used to be 24hrs the fact that they get 2 nites now must be such a relief great video as always \n",

      "shows how good the redundancy engineering is i guess able to land safely on a single wheel article did not mention it does anyone know if it was able to taxi by itself or did it stop on the runway and wait for a tow  according to avherald it taxied in unaware of the missing wheel  impressive thanks for the link  even more impressive that they did not even notice it was missing  or that nobody on the ground saw it and reported it  the departure airport apparently reported tire fragments on the runway after takeoff the arrival airport was notified to be on alert when it landed  they did you can clearly see them take cell phones pictures to post on reddit for karma in that picture it is kind of a redditception reddit post of a reddit post  thats why there is 2 of them these nose wheels are getting out of hand  well some sukhoi su27 only got one nosewheel right well one weighs 18 tons and the other weighs 220 legit question here  does having uneven support like this cause damage to the landing gear due to uneven distribution of forces or is the gear itself engineered to work with just one wheel and the second wheel is safety redundancy for this exact reason of a wheel potentially falling off  good question from the look of it the entire tire snapped off i would not be surprised if the entire gear assembly needs to be replaced  pilot left nosewheel lost engineer left nosewheel given a gps and told to cut it out  caption  r aviation is gonna love this one   i do not think we need that  boeing engineers write that down write that down  and someone already painted the sound it made under the windscreen who is scoot and how do they have enough for a dreamliner  they are owned by singapore airlines a low cost subsidiary to be specific i flew scoot on a couple short hops recently they are fine definitely a low cost carrier but not the lowest of cost carriers planes appeared pretty nice though one engine made a relatively concerning noise on spool up you are packed in there pretty tight which is a bit of a difference coming off a 16 5hr singapore air flight in premium economy but they give you some snacks if you booked through singapore air on a scoot flight would not mind flying them again would be interesting to be on a long haul flight as mine were all on a320s an hour or so  they are the absolute bottom dogshit of lccs will make you pay for literally everything and do not take criticism at all i never had fees for carryon or checked luggage service was prompt planes were nice on the inside if barebones nothing glaringly awful that they could control crying babies for 15 minutes before landing do not count i dunno did not particularly mind them lccs in the us are worse  they charge you for food carryon checked the ife system power port and will shout at you if you film a video my flights were too short to want a plug or ife so never had that chance i did not get charged for carryon and i guess the times i flew with checked were a ticket booked on singapore airlines who comped that cost they definitely got annoyed at my headphones during takeoff and landing but i flew the same leg on singapore once and they told me to take them off too not defending them too hard but they are no spirit or frontier air in the us  yh they are so so much worse if you book through them and not singapore literally the worst airline i have been on yeah i flew scoot on a hop to bali from sg they use the 78 for capacity reasons i can only imagine the type of service provided by a carrier that elicits an image of a dog scooting his ass across the carpet  elicits thanks  that is actually accurate and it is a shit covered ass too surprisingly a lot of not so well known airlines have 787 another example is zipair tidy salt imminent long fall ink grandfather different sip sand this post was mass deleted and anonymized with  feels like a bad spot to stand i like how they still chocked the single tire  kept scooting down the runway though  it is too bad i like this aircraft  safety wire cotter pins with a second person inspection are important  the front wheel fell off  i would like to point out that this is not typical  too many cardboard derivatives i have always thought wheels on the left side of axles should have left tightly threads for the spindle nut pikachu jet if there is pikachu imagine a lightning strikes the plane because there is pikachu nice from where to where are you flying from singapore to melbourne thanks i hope to catch that plane too   why can not they get the photo correct that is a skymark 737  waiting for it to be evolved  very apt when scoot cancels your ticket and there is no refund surprised airline face  are you talking about this this is jetstar or is there another recent case of no refund  aiyo is so cute why spend money on painting the plane when you are a discount airline just use that money to improve your service  what kind of service are you expecting from a budget airline  too late the hype died by 2019 pokemon anime pokemon nintendo games pokemon tretta  lol pokemon is a household name there is always hype for new pokemon related things gotta catch them all kind of pointless when jp aint even opened to the world unless you are on official biz guided tours  i will be taking that same flight w ana in a few months  now there is an airline i never heard of before  yes i think business from thailand better than from singapore thailand is not mandating dedicated flights you can arrive through any flight  if only 1 way is vtl then does not it defeat the purpose of vtl unless it is meant to send back deported britons like the anti mask sovereign can go there cannot come back  can not wait   it is been so so so long   singapore is vtl strategy is quickly falling behind the rest of asia is more progressive opening   gt scoot to launch flights to london via bangkok from dec 16 using boeing 787 dreamliner planes gt singapore travellers heading to london will have more flight choices with budget carrier scoot launching services from singapore to the british capital on dec 16 gt the low cost arm of flag carrier singapore airlines sia said on friday nov 12 that the flights to london is gatwick airport via bangkok will initially take place three times weekly for only two weeks before resuming on march 22 next year gt the journey including transit time in bangkok is expected to take about 16 hours with one way tickets priced from dollar434 gt but passengers targeting quarantine free travel between singapore and london can achieve that only on the scoot flights to london the return flights are not designated flights that they can use to tap the vaccinated travel lane vtl scheme gt instead they will have to book a designated vtl flight either from british airways ba or sia ba operates four such flights to singapore weekly while sia offers daily flights gt scoot said on friday that it will use the widebody boeing 787 dreamliner planes which can seat more than 300 passengers for the route gt it added that the london flights are seasonal scheduled services a further review and potential increase in frequency will be based on demand and regulatory approval gt mr campbell wilson chief executive of scoot said the route will enable the airline to benefit from the demand for quarantine free travel between britain and thailand gt mr wilson who noted that the carrier will be the only low cost operator between bangkok and london added the progressive relaxation of international borders presents new opportunities for airlines and travellers alike  gt london will be scoot is third destination in europe after berlin in germany and athens in greece gt scoot will serve more than 30 destinations in december with the addition of london prior to the covid 19 pandemic it was flying to 68 cities  1 0 2     to fly out to london you can take any flight if you want to come back via vtl at the moment the only option is the daily sia flight from heathrow  vtl is by country not by airline sia fly to a lot of non vtl countries    scoot already offers vtl flights from berlin but thailand is not yet a vtl country so it will not a be vtl flight no matter which airline it is  thought that this was a dumb move initially but on further thought i think it is a rly smart move by scoot to capitalise on the london bangkok fifth freedom route the singapore bangkok route is definitely going to be loss making  gt barry need another one named other barry   are we at vr barry  sure are other barry   what is vne barry a challenge other barry  or his australian cousin bazza  instead of other barry call the next one dylan  another one i am guessing 3 3 3 seating and 336 passengers on a 787 8 still the opportunity to take a 787 is one not to be passed up especially when it is guaranteed to be one if you book with this airline i might be in the minority here but i have flown ana and ua 787s and i can not notice a difference in the noise level or the pressure the only thing i did notice was that the wing flex was insane and that the tips looked like they are above the cabin roof i was sitting in business and businessfirst if that makes a difference with the the noise much rather prefer a 777 300er or the old school 747 400 which i am sitting in right now in upper deck than a 787 working wise as i have never flown as a passenger i think it is fairly noticeable how quieter the 787 is compared to the 777 200 300 as for the pressurization thing i do not feel any difference but then from my point of view the amount of passengers and the configuration i work on makes much more noticeable difference anyway  i always thought that the pressurization was not an immediate effect that you notice but rather not feeling tired and exhausted after the flight  i agree i imagine unless you start testing your lungs by exercising in flight your not going to notice a difference by immediate feel  i think it is more quiet especially when taxiing when i took the dreamliner i sat right over the wings and i thought it was smoother and more quiet especially vs the 747 400 or the 77w the engine noise is noticeable  just flew one noise wise not as quiet as a380 but i arrived not tired at all 15hr flight  i found the engines to be very quiet but the wing had a lot of aerodynamic noise unless all wings are that loud and it is usually downed out by the engine  personally i did but i can not say that everyone else would also the larger windows and newer interior are a big plus  yeah 3 3 3 there are about 30 business class seats 2 2 2 just got back from tianjin gotta say the 787 is pretty awesome cheap prices together with great service make for an excellent flight experience even though meals are expensive  scoot biz is 2 3 2 is not it  i do not think so i might be wrong though edit i am wrong there are 35 scootbiz seats on the boeing 787 9 aircraft the seats are black in colour in 2 3 2 configuration with 38 seat pitch from wiki just have to google photos of the 787 scootbiz wow a business class with almost 50percent chance of no aisle access  yes you are wrong  fedex names all their planes after employee is children  what is your plane is name  accident  shark bait go ahead iceland air is the first airline to operate an all 757 fleet and they also name their aircraft   will be they still have 2 777s running until they are replaced  aircraft  with a small fleet like this hoe many pilots are hired for the company  could have sworn that was ana s      they went all 787 in sept that said there is a very slight caveat in that they can still sub in 777s to cover when needed e g the tz7 tz8 rotation to my local airport yesterday  here have this  it is not done yet otc is still flying  wrong    always nice to have another way to get direct from melbourne to a se asia hub although 340 economy seats in a 787  oh god no 6 hours with 8 inches of knee space  7 hours  but you can always pay extra for scoot stretch  i suspect singapore airlines may pull one of their flights to accommodate this  ahh that is why i saw two very pretty scoot flight attendants on scooters at vic market tram stop today any indiication of pricing  they are having a sale right now for 24h 300 return or 600 return business class pretty good imo  scoot has got to be the worst airline i have ever used     gt story time it is not much of a story to be honest flew from taipei to tokyo uncomfortable seats staff were not great and the pre purchased food that you can choose off a menu when you book online was horrid i guess i just got off feeling pretty shit about the whole experience and i have flown with tiger  ouch i will not even fly jetstar anymore   gt uncomfortable seats staff were not great and the pre purchased food that you can choose off a menu when you book online was horrid sounds much like my recent qantas experiences minus the paying for food  i envy you \n"
