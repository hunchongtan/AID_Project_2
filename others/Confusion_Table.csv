i swear i will never buy airline tickets from this airline again and will warn you not to believe their advertisements they told me that i bought the tickets online so they would not be responsible for my tickets at all so why do they still sell tickets online ,0,0
thank you very much for this wonderful video we hope to dedicate a video in order to solve the problems that occur in many airlines in america canada europe and various countries when a person is very advised and influences the person on his side here is the problem the people who advise must pay the amount for two seats so that they do not crowd others we are facing this problem this problem must be solved in fact all companies think only for the sake of money not for the sake of human comfort and this is what we see and this is considered a big mistake and planes that transport passengers must be well maintained for the safety of aviation and for the safety of society many accidents have occurred and the reason is a lack of maintenance and this is considered very important the danger of companies only thinking about how to collect money they did not look at the safety of society they did not look at the safety of the plane especially the maintenance maintenance is important especially the engines and all the equipment during my trip in america the flying was very not good in terms of food and in terms of cleanliness an international law must be put in place in terms of cleanliness and in terms of treatment as well as maintenance the plane is for the safety of people,1,2

hi sam thanks for show the scoot and i would like to try it for my next travel to sydney to visit my family ,1,2
scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money ,0,0

dude this is the reality of the hard working flight attendants okkkuuuuurrrrr,1,1
i have never heard of this airline i am very impressed i would definitely choose them given the opportunity i flew across the us two days several mishaps occurred but of course that is no reason to behave poorly i like to believe everyone is doing their best finally arrived at my destination many many hours later than expected but i am alive hahaha we had to abort the landing due to wind turbulence from the plane taking off in front of us i woke the other passengers up shouting oh shit oh shit as i watched the wings wobble dramatically fun times i was on a united flight and they gave us free food to make up for all the nonsense so that was nice of them hopefully my red eye back home will be less exciting ,0,2

welcome to melbourne,1,2
i will be honest scoot is actually a good flight i have always had a really good experience with them,2,2
i went on scoot last month and came back with singapore airlines because scoot airlines is horrible i went from melbourne to singapore about 7 hours it was the worst flight ever everyone on board were complaining too saying they would never fly with scoot again there was no aircon at all and on that day it was boiling also which airline does not give you water unless you pay 4 us dollars water has always been free and the water they give you is such a small amount for 4 us dollars that your still thirsty afterwards their food was horrible too and of course the crew members were very rude they had a rude attitude and if you would press the flight attendant light they would take ages to come honestly i would never fly it again and i wish i knew before flying because that was suppose to be one of the best trips of my life ,0,0
