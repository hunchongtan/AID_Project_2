indestructible then you lost it ,LABEL_0
i used my umbrella for shield wielder training i will combine it with any martial art style ,LABEL_1
i guess the other umbrellas were not a fan to the wind machine ,LABEL_0
the question is would you seriously spend dollar350 on an umbrella ,LABEL_1
really worth 350 bucks,LABEL_1
test it in hurricane level amount of wind,LABEL_1
 manners maketh man ,LABEL_1
journalism,LABEL_1
dollar350 that will get stolen while you get coffee pass i rather get wet,LABEL_0
unless i can travel with it like mary poppins dollar350 is a bit much plus it still flips inside out like any other umbrella and most regular umbrellas do not break immediately ,LABEL_1
i was in like 1st grade and my spider man umbrella got destroyed by the wind,LABEL_0
and then you accidentally left it on a chair or against the wall,LABEL_0
i would probably buy that if i was a millionaire ,LABEL_2
not quite sure if making the umbrella indestructible is the right way to go i mean if the wind is strong and the umbrella does not fold i will literally fly away like mary poppins it should fold without breaking in on a strong wind not support the wind by not bending ,LABEL_1
this is some hard hitting journalism thank you ,LABEL_2
no one wants to do a mary poppins,LABEL_0
reminds me of a time in the 1900s a guy made a strong umbrella and decided to showcase its strength by jumping of a building while holding it he splattered on the tarmac at terminal velocity,LABEL_1
i do not use umbrellas,LABEL_0
i bought an umbrella from ikea for gbp8 that used flexible metal rods the wind will not break it as it simply bends and can be bent back ,LABEL_2
or you can spend dollar5 on normal umbrella and if it breaks you spend another dollar5 i mean its not made with nasa shuttle touched by aliens grade material but still wont cost you dollar350 either ,LABEL_1
normal people do not go out in weather that bad so that is just really your fault isnt it ,LABEL_0
i am not about to fight with an umbrella im finna just be wet ,LABEL_0

perfect for accidentally leaving it in a ny cab,LABEL_1

i remember like a few years ago i had to go to school on a really rainy and windy day students in our school do not come from a school bus and most of us go by mtr and u have to walk a bit since not everyone is home is near the mtr it was so rainy and i did not have a raincoat on and i only had an umbrella i did not expect it to be that windy and stuff so i only brought a normal small umbrella but 5 minutes outside and that umbrella broke anyways i threw it away and went into a mall for cover since i still had to go to the mtr and waited for the rain to lessen the rain eventually lessened and i ran so fast into the mtr and luckily i was not too soaked i still had to walk from the mtr to school but i did not have an umbrella but even on a normal day the area near my school is pretty windy so it was ultra max extremely windy people stood inside the mtr for shelter cus the people outside looked like they were abt to fly away frm the wind and thankfully my friend was there with a huge umbrella both of us shared it but it was so windy even her gigantic umbrella went inside out she had a raincoat boots and a thing to cover her backpack mean while i had nothing so i just ran again and my school has two zebra crossings that is traffic lights take one whole minute each before turning green so i took a whole shower there i was soaked af when i reached school and my hair was like dripping along with my uniform and schoolbag it was a fun experience though,LABEL_0
finally an umbrella parachute,LABEL_1
nope that is never happened to me i am not delicate and fragile water does not hurt me just put your shoulders up and run,LABEL_1
ima buy this when i am rich ,LABEL_2
yeah ai not no way i am wasting 350dollar on a umbrella i have a jacket for that lol,LABEL_1
i can see som1 being pulled by this and suing,LABEL_0
i feel like this umbrella is over engineered simply reduce the drag of the umbrella is underside to reduce the force placed on it as a bonus you will not be pulled around ,LABEL_1
does it shoot rubber bullets or poison gas like james bond ones ,LABEL_1
can not beat mary poppins umbrella,LABEL_1
scam ,LABEL_0
love the idea but i will lose it too quickly for the price maybe ok with an air tag,LABEL_1
one day we will be able to jump from high places and float down slowly,LABEL_2
better to just buy a umbrella at a reasonable price,LABEL_1
yeah its strong because its stronggggg it can pull you in the sky its like a parachute later shot on iphone but your gonna steal be wet,LABEL_2
wind machine,LABEL_1
penguin approves,LABEL_2

commercial,LABEL_1
then do not use umbrellas when there is just wind ,LABEL_1
fantastic marketing ,LABEL_0
when a test of your product is really a test of human will power ,LABEL_1
at this point we may as well start producing more kites more kites means lower selling point that means i can finally get into kite surfing and land kiting for cheap lol ,LABEL_2
god said john 14 6 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me ,LABEL_1
i would prefer a senz umbrella over this one ,LABEL_1
i can imagine someone actually making an umbrella designed to not go inside out and in extremely strong winds when testing it someone flies away and ends up somewhere else lets say area 51,LABEL_1
me when i have it flys to dubai and drop it from the tallest building with a balcony near burj khalifa,LABEL_1
still not gonna pay 350 for an umbrella come on now whats the warranty on it ,LABEL_0

i always assumed umbrellas doing that was a safety feature because you do not want to get blown with it or lose it if you drop it though,LABEL_1
yes,LABEL_1
the real test is whether or not you lose it placing it down and forgetting it theft ,LABEL_1
the kingsman ,LABEL_1

the word aircraft takes it to another level and marks it up dollar100 ,LABEL_1
that umbrella will hold you up while taking you up mary poppins,LABEL_2
rolls royce be like how much for your company ,LABEL_1
i feel like it is necessary for it to snap backwards otherwise the wind is going to more easily drag you backwards like mary poppins er something,LABEL_1

this is stupid so let me get this straight they want 350dollar for a umbrella i would only use occasionally not frequent for the novelty that it will not get damaged in extreme weather would not it be better to just buy another umbrella that is 20 30dollar after my old umbrella was destroyed ,LABEL_0
wowowow,LABEL_2
try it against jet engine ,LABEL_1
we know anything called indestructible will be destructible soon lol,LABEL_1
i had an old umbrella of my grandfather is called a bumberchute or bumbershoot maybe hyphenated words anyway it literally would not turn inside out ,LABEL_1
my umbrella was made with flexible inside support so it can also do inside out on strong winds without being destroyed but it only cost 20 dollars ,LABEL_1
all we need now is an umbrella that does not bend upwards in strong winds,LABEL_1
fly away like mary poppins with the full speed wind machine,LABEL_1
think of it this way how many times will you use a dollar350 umbrella in your lifetime i would rather buy a dollar10 umbrella and replace it after wear and tear because i am confident i will not go through 35 dollar10 umbrellas before i go through 1 dollar350 umbrella ,LABEL_1
it is just a big fan,LABEL_1
that is pretty insane that in some parts of the world where wind is so damn strong,LABEL_0
bruh who will biy a umbrella 350 even though its strong you will still struggle holding them up so it kinda useless to use,LABEL_0

an umbrellas purpose is to stop rain how does this help you could either pay ten dollars for an umbrella that will break in the wind and replace it for another ten dollars or you could pay dollar350 for an umbrella that still will not keep you dry you could buy thirty five new umbrellas for the same amount of money assuming you get super unlucky and get caught in a wind storm and break your umbrella thirty five times ,LABEL_0
350 no thxdollar,LABEL_1
nothing is indestructible i think ,LABEL_1

its kinda questionable from an engineering perspective afaik to make this indistructable umbrella because it seems to maintain it is surface area too easily under extreme conditions and could thus become a health hazard providing strong enough wind a umbrella might drag a person away into a potentially dangerous situation better that the umbrella gives under those circumstances ,LABEL_0

this dude really recommending dollar130 dollar umbrellas talking the talk as if he knows what he is talking about and just showing water as the primary test subject to test the umbrellas expensive umbrellas are either made from steel or fiber glass all of my umbrellas are totes or nautica i paid lt dollar20 for each the center pole and the ribs are made from steel and the fabric is heavy nylon they have withstanded heavy winds and being blown backwards ,LABEL_1
well embroidered with akashic ,LABEL_1
testing a cheap retractable umbrella vs expensive full length umbrella is the epitome of foolish experimentation ,LABEL_0
bro 10 dollar is also expensive ,LABEL_0
its not the rain its the wind,LABEL_1
i want my 100 inch folded umbrella with water proof and windproof that can stand 350 mph tornado wind and anti ultra violet sunproof and rainproof and damaged proof and storm proof and hurricane proof and weather proof and lightning proof and strongest 100 pieces ribs proof  ,LABEL_1
i have a cheap umbrella and it is spf and wind proof also it is better than the dollar133 one in the video ,LABEL_2
it is the stupid facial expression for me ,LABEL_0
why did he move while testing cheap but stand still while holding expensive ,LABEL_1
bro why did you have to wet my whole family tree ,LABEL_0
wow you hold the expensive one tighter so cool,LABEL_2
you should add a lightning test lmao,LABEL_1
bro said ,LABEL_1
it is water what do you mean by better safe the sorry,LABEL_1
you put a lot more water on the cheaper one,LABEL_1
dollar133 for an umbrella you can get a half downer one over her for like gbp10 gbp15,LABEL_1
ah yes dumping water is rain,LABEL_1
dharr mann it is better safe than sorry,LABEL_1

dollar133 for a umbrella surprised holy crap,LABEL_0
you can only change one variable when testing something and that variable was the value of the umbrellas the fact that you held one higher and the other one lower is changing more than one variable there for your test is not valid,LABEL_0
not like you help the expensive umbrella higher up and had less rain,LABEL_1

repel umbrella sucks quality is garbage ,LABEL_0
it is such a shame blunt umbrellas are not mentioned here,LABEL_0
hi,LABEL_1
 dear good fellow,LABEL_2
simhachala siva amp good day ,LABEL_2
where do i buy one or two ,LABEL_1
i have always wondered about this but this could very well be a marketing gimmick for people who can not even hold an umbrella with the wind going 25 mph while this video is 7 years old i have noticed that many online publications rate this dollar30 umbrella extremely high could it be because it is easier to sell a dollar30 product which is widely available at various stores compared to a higher end umbrella for snooty people to walk from the exit of a large building to a cab or limo i mean really is an umbrella the best thing for high winds you are essentially becoming a sailor it probably makes more sense to invest in a good raincoat but expect to be stuffy those breathable raincoats rely on some kind of light water repellent finish that comes off in the wash or with wear do not forget the safety glasses if you really want to walk around in high winds scratch cornea is the worst pain you will ever experience hard hat makes sense too ,LABEL_1
you sold me buying mine now,LABEL_1
really this is impressive as hell you subjected this to a sustained turbulent wake coming off your car the anomemeter was likely understating wind speed based on where it was unless you are a freak your hand would have let go by now and you would be struggling to walk ,LABEL_1
is this guy serious  you only proved how durable these things really are also the wind should blow the other way  like waiting for a semi truck to speed by to see if it could withstand a gust of wind going up underneath  that was a waste of time sir a total waste of time hahahah,LABEL_0
because of this video i will buy 10 of these thank you ,LABEL_2
i have one and i have no desire testing it in a hurricane so yes it works just fine for normal use,LABEL_2
wow,LABEL_1
please do more video like these ,LABEL_2
um thanks now lets seat an elephant on a backyard swingset to test durability unattainableexpectations ,LABEL_1
does it blow up if held normally need to see if it turns inside out,LABEL_1
i did not know joe satriani did umbrella wind tests ,LABEL_1
what the fuck did i just watch i guess you can not drag this behind a car at 50 mph dang,LABEL_0
ok you was not kidding around ,LABEL_1
thanks looks like it withstood very well thumbs up to the brand what i am really curious about is whether it can avoid flipping within reasonable wind speeds ,LABEL_2
lmaooo savage test two thumbs up from me ,LABEL_1
next up testing bulletproof vests shoots 50bmg followed by antitank rounds nope not bulletproof,LABEL_0
worthless review ,LABEL_0
by the test the repel umbrella performs extremely well above any other it is illogical to think that an umbrella can stand winds of 40 speed his expectations are absurd this guy should design an umbrella made of steel for himself ,LABEL_1
nice test check out doppler knirps bmw windtunels tests ,LABEL_2
if you are out in 60mph winds i really think an umbrella not lasting a minute should be the least of your concerns,LABEL_1
actually this is pretty impressive to me it is a beautiful umbrella and i doubt i will be walking in 40 mph winds ,LABEL_2
this is actually fairly impressive ,LABEL_2
good video but does not simulate gusts even the leading brands tested up to 60mph probably would not resist 60 mph of constant resistance at one angle ,LABEL_1
i think your bar is a bit too high for wind proof who is gonna be outside 45 mph winds plus the way people hold an umbrella in the rain cause the wind to attack from the umbrella is underside your test imposed high aerodynamic stress on the umbrella is outside which is stress it may not have been designed to handle at the magnitudes tested in your video ,LABEL_0
next time i am riding on the outside of a car on the parkway i will remember not to use my repel umbrella silly test ,LABEL_1
very informative ,LABEL_2
i idea,LABEL_1
thank you ,LABEL_2
bad luck to open an umbrella in a indoor room ,LABEL_0

good review man thanks for that ,LABEL_2
great review looked this up to make sure i understood the opening mechanism,LABEL_2
i do not recommend this product at all even tho it supposedly has a lifetime warranty i would not expect it to break so quickly for how much i paid yet mine broke and now i have to go through the hassle of getting it repaired when it should not have broken in the first place ,LABEL_0
wherever you end up purchasing take a very close look at your umbrella i ordered mine from walmart in total black it came with blue sky underneath the umbrella i received was the correct brand but it was not at all double vented that tell tale band that the vented umbrellas have yeah not there at all it was simply a well made normal travel umbrella not something for which you would spend dollar30 so either someone could not read an order form possible or someone thought i would not notice ,LABEL_1
auto close is not working 1st day,LABEL_0
thanks for the review was checking out the umbrella on their website and had to watch a review to see if it was legit ,LABEL_1
