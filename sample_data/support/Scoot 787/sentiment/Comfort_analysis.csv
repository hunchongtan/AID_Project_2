the silence section sounds like a really good option for such a long haul flight curious how much more it costs i just tried on their website but did not want to go too far so did not find out ,LABEL_2
this year in march the scoot flight economy cost as much as singapore airlines economy did last year for the same trip not really a cheap cost anymore but still cheap quality two hours with scoot was enough for me ,LABEL_2
well i flew long haul non budget airlines and all i wanna do is sleep tbh youd only spend an hour on the entertainment what is more impt to me is a spotify playlist hahaha,LABEL_1
i will spend anytime in a low cost airline at least there is entertainment in the airline app,LABEL_2

those amenities are literally the same as you would experience flying long haul full fare economy on a major flag carrier like lufthansa british airways etc back in the 70 is amp 80 is no screens power outlets or adjustable headrests back then either had to deal with cigarette smoke in the cabin as well and the same crappy microwave quality meals to boot the difference of course being that the full fare you paid back then would have been many thousands of euros in todays money rather than only the 300 odd euros that scoot charges for the same thing as the man says you get what you pay for ,LABEL_0
thanks for the video low price is perfectly ok on shorter trips but not on long trips like this next month i am going on holiday to thailand from scandinavia then i take finnair down and emirates back economy class my holiday already starts with the flight which should be comfortable and i am willing to pay for that ,LABEL_2
even though i travel always on budget i am glad that i have enough money to not need to consider taking scoot for long haul flights travelling on budget and being cheap or low on money are 2 different things anyway ,LABEL_2
can do 13 hrs standing on my head anything else is a bonus as long as it is cheap enough ,LABEL_2

it is great seeing economy class reviews my wife and i just completed a twelve hour flight between nadi fiji and vancouver canada these are the type of flights for which we need truthful reviews thanks ,LABEL_2
i love flying scoot i usually bring a big empty bottle at least 1 litre and fill it up airside before boarding bring my own food sandwiches or some bread rolls or even mcdonalds from singapore airport again airside have a power bank and many movies downloaded on my tablet with my noise cancelling earphones with all of this for me it is just like a normal flight that costs twice as much so get organised and put the saved dollar to more spending money at your destination ,LABEL_2
its affordable you get what you pay for ,LABEL_1
ok i flew them and to be honest they are not bad and the seat was more comfortable than i expected i did manage to get some sleep on the flight about the water make sure you bring enough bottles to fill them up before boarding and may be fee snacks i would suggest pay a little extra to reserve scoot silence or a bit more extra for front row seats for more comfortable flights i would not mine flying scoot again if the deal is great value ,LABEL_2
it is not recommended to travel long haul with budget airlines if you want a little bit comfort or not bored to death sitting beside a not so normal size human sitting beside you travelled with airasia to auckland nz with two layovers in kl and gold coast with no entertainment eye mask ear muffles or pillow and yes inflight extras as expensive lol ,LABEL_0
dude i flew to nz and back for only 400 more with entertainment and food included but cheers for doing this ,LABEL_2
for me scoot is a hit or miss and i agreed te food was not the best if i fkew long haul with low cost carrier my first choice will always be air asia on their premium flatbed vor routes between malaysia to australia the food is surprisingly decent however scoot is still better than another lc carrier cebu pacific that one is reslly brutal and only for the strong amd extremely budget minded person they fly between the philippines to australia and the middle east ,LABEL_2
i literally flew scoot economy class from singapore to berlin and back in dec 2021 5 months later i flew on a full service airline from singapore to london and back and i realised why people paid for full service ,LABEL_1
just flew scoot as someone from the us who refuses to fly spirit but loves southwest i was hopeful that scoot would be more like southwest which while budget seems to prioritize passenger is comfort vs spirit which nickels and dimes you for everything unfortunately definitely came off more like spirit with extra for wi fi and all packages limited data amounts extra for charging no streaming entertainment no adjustable headrests and worst no complimentary beverages including water when we were not allowed to bring our own onboard due to the way the singapore gate was setup ,LABEL_0

i flew berlin to singapore on scoot in 2018 very basic and it was delayed 24 hours the onward flight to melbourne ended up being on singapore airlines because of the delay essentially it is about expectations keep your expectations low and relax no problems ,LABEL_0
i am from singapore and i love this airline this is my personal advice to everyone please just upgrade your seats to reclining sleeping seats this should be the premier package that comes with a screen and charging port for you i do this for all flights exceeding 6 hours best of all some flights have screens and charging ports for you on the economy class but i still always recommend everyone to just upgrade your seat to the reclining ones ,LABEL_2
great content lots of things can be planned for tone fair bring a tablet iots of water and food most airports offer free filling so bring an empty bottle and your golden ,LABEL_2
great video i live on the east coast of australia brisbane and the nearest international airport is 15 mins from my house so it is fairly convenient to fly a full service international airline to asia americas middle east and beyond conversely we have access to budget airlines mainly flying from the gold coast 1 5 2hrs by car i have often costed out a trip on a full service airline from brisbane vs a budget airline from the gold coast and after the added expense on transport to the airport luggage meals etc the full service airline generally wins from a economic and comfort perspective takeaway points research all prices and add ons the budget price may not be so budget after all,LABEL_2
great review i love it when vloggers actually fly like the rest of us in economy ,LABEL_2
this all looks completely fine ,LABEL_2
food is not up to scratch blame the berlin catering kitchen food is prepared on the land side of the airport that the airline is departing from food is better on air asia i would be surprised if it was not given that it was asian style food prepared in an asian country ,LABEL_1
flown scoot a few times honestly the food was okay i thought also had both the nasi lemak and mums fried rice will need to give air asia a go to see how it compares ,LABEL_2
best seats on this flight are in the crew rest area   having flown airasiax on the a330 a few years back i found it to be pretty decent about 20 rows of seats for passengers over 12 years only  bliss ,LABEL_2
i took my flight algiers to montreal with air algeria it was 9h flight the seat is very comfortable but there is not inflightentrinment the food is serving free so i spend with my device without inflightentrinment it was good,LABEL_2
i made my 8hr flight from sing to mel super comfortable by paying a little for an exit row and then i brought my own food water and phone with predownloaded entertainment it was honestly super nice,LABEL_2
320 euros one way 640 euros return  i can find flights with decent airlines for that price anytime,LABEL_2
the secret to surviving long flight on scoot is to pick book a timing you will sleep super well in i fell asleep when the plane took off and when i woke up the plane was landing best flight experience for a budget airline scoot business has also better seats than economy class of major airlines for similar price points the only downside is the lack of entertainment ,LABEL_2
a very interesting video for me i have personally flown economy on scoot 787s a number of times between sydney and singapore it is pretty much like any other reputable airline so i would happily fly that route again given the low price i might even fly on to europe from singapore but only after a stopover in my opinion it is inappropriate to compare the cost of a meal on a low budget carrier like scoot and what you might pay for a similar meal in an everyday situation it is very expensive to provide hot meals etc on planes and not doing so is how the low cost carrier can offer low fares the more appropriate question is what is the total package costing compared to a full service flight even with the egregious price for water etc the total price for this trip is amazingly low it is not quite as amazing as the headline price but it is still amazing i would also eat before getting on the plane and either fast preorder a light meal or bring some food with me given it is such a long flight you can take a book a tablet headphones and an external battery this will make it as good as any other economy flight if it is not good enough one needs to go business class ,LABEL_1
they really push the law of supply and demand lol they do not let you bring your own water unless it is bought from the airport which is just as overpriced,LABEL_0

flew on scoot from singapore to cebu as a singapore air transfer it was business class and figured in total price under 3 hours from lax to singapore on singapore air then scoot to cebu singapore air is great living in washington state now eva air seattle to taiwan to cebu being 182 cm tall and and 98 kg i use business as more comfortable do not think i could make it 13 hours on basic economy it is the tight seating ,LABEL_2
great video ,LABEL_2
dude it is a 787 dreamliner the state of the art and aviation comfort how rough could it have been ,LABEL_1
well when my sister and me travelled to singapore in 1993 we did so without in flight entertainment too because it was not yet a thing they fed us though ,LABEL_1
the lack of adjustable headrests on these scoot 787 aircraft would be the main downfall for me same on air asia a330 one of the worst flights in my life was on an air asia a330 impossible to sleep surprisingly t way air from korea however surprisingly comfortable in seat power holder for ipad in seat tray adjustable headrest etc made them far more comfortable for longer journey ,LABEL_1
you got a very good price but usually it is more like euro 450 for the sector berlin to singapore singapore to berlin is even higher the final price for a return ticket is raw sgd 1330 at this moment for a return flight in june no changi prison style meals no platinum water included wait  i noticed the meals they serve at changi prison are nicer a return flight with quatar or finnair is around sgd 1500 at the moment i get proper meals videos nicer seats free water etc etc to my experience scoot is often not worth it it is only that particular leg that is a bit cheaper ,LABEL_2

to be fair most of us aussies do not consider a 7hr flight to singapore as a long haul flight ,LABEL_1
i like how it is spelled mum is ,LABEL_2
i fly often on scoot between singapore and melbourne though it is comparatively shorter at 7 to 8 hours i tend to go for the scoot in silence section where the legroom is a bit more generous during the early days and at quiet times of the year this option was not taken up much so occasionally i get the whole 3 seats to myself where i can lie flat ,LABEL_1
for those on a limited income re long haul travel scoot have come to the party in providing a affordable ticket rate to get from point a to b ,LABEL_1
so basically the same as economy on most major airlines i do not see a lot more on offer here except perhaps for in flight entertainment which a lot of people do not need anyway as they bring their own devices you can get water for free from the bathrooms it is a myth that it is unsanitary and surely the flight attendants would bring you a cup of water if you asked nicely i find it hard to imagine why they would not ,LABEL_0
i went from perth to london non stop on this plane via qantas i loved every minute on cattle class had mum by my side i am 6ft3 n i still made 16 hours lol,LABEL_2
did this flight to sydney in december euros1600 return inc checked bag total rip so many babies and those add on prices have also risen they do not allow you to bring your own pot noodles and charge hard for hot water this was the best value flight going though so had no choice before c vid it was luxury flying via china for euros700 return ,LABEL_2
i flew the norwegian to gatwick on norwegian air very pleasant so much better than scoot ,LABEL_2
bottled still water costs 9 euros per litre in most average swiss restaurants on the ground ,LABEL_1
paying 300euros as single flight does not even seem that good of a deal i spent around 660euros from stuttgart to singapore via a transfer in istanbul for the full flight via turkish airlines with unlimited water and free onboard meals in basic economy,LABEL_0
if its really cheap and the gap is really big between this flight and a more regular economy one maybe but just for the comfort and features included with other companies and mostly free features i will go with another company than this one even if there is 2 flights ,LABEL_2
i have flown scoot silence twice in sep 2019 and sep 2022 on the sin syd route i expected to pre order food or pay dollardollardollar on board a little preparation goes a long way if you fill up a water bottle after security compared to my onward journey on ba economy i have to say the scoot air cabin staff are way more customer focussed than their counterparts nothing is ever a problem i would defo recommend scoot for flying on a budget ,LABEL_2
well for me i fly scoot very often and it is normal and not bad for a 3 hours flight from singapore to thailand i just booked a flight in scoot to thailand and flying scoot is cheap and excellent why do everyone keep on hating cheap airlines and prefer expensive ones there are very minimal difference between cheap and expensive airlines,LABEL_2
i do not mind paying for food and i can bring a book or switch for entertainment as long as it is a widebody i think i can handle it ,LABEL_2
thai smile airways for 1 hour was great they even gave a bottle of water a snack sized sandwich and coffee or tea i will consider them in the future and if you upgrade you get access to the thai airways lounge as for ifes i can survive without if need be i remember when you had to bring a newspaper magazine or book with you if you wanted entertainment ,LABEL_2
i fly with them before c19 3x from berlin to bali its very cheap last time around 400usd two way i bring to backpack instant food mana and shaker and thats all watter i was take in toilet wastaffel and done because they menu is crazy overpriced ,LABEL_1
faultless review i agree about the water that is a bit rich is there a water bubbler available to refill water bottles on scoot other airlines have them as an aussie when scoot have a sale it is deadset the cheapest way to get to europe by a huge margin so we will definitely be trying to put up with the discomfort the next time we go great review thanks ,LABEL_2
very nice onboard report greetings from japan ,LABEL_2
inspite of being low cost airlines scoot service is quite satisfied but regarding the meal i felt that airlines need to improve a lot recently flew frm phuket to singapore and it was a good trip ,LABEL_2
my only objections are the charges for power and water is water poured in a cup at least free ,LABEL_1
i have a similar route for june but premium economy with singapore lisbon via germany singapore and 4days after new zealand i will be able to try the new zealand skycoach but unfortunately de flight back from singapore to frankfurt the a380 was replaced by a 777 and i specifically booked to catch the doubledecker but well let me know if you want me to make some clips ahahah thanks for the clip ,LABEL_1
if i had to or it was way cheaper than a standard airline then yes given yr able to take yr own food and drink supplies this makes a better yes ,LABEL_2
last year i got this flight for 230euros in total for both directions berlin to bangkok with a short stay in singapore was fine for the price but not for more money,LABEL_1

airasia x kul to tehran already discountiuned in 2018 it was a 8 hrs flight but i enjoyed it on the return to kl i was able to sleep on the whole middle row myself to be honest air asia is paid catering are much better than many other ordinary airlines,LABEL_2
12 hours but it has to be a night flight and reach the destination by morning so i can sleep 3 4 of the flight the rest of the entertainment would be an ipad and steamdeck if i fly scoot for 6 hours and less i usually book the normal isle or window seat and for 6 hours i book their scoot because i want to sleep more comfortably ,LABEL_1
you are correct you get what you pay for scoot and air asia are both superb low cost carriers asias version of ryanair making travelling more fun for less ,LABEL_2
nice 1 the longest i take was 8 hours,LABEL_1
 2 00 not every aussie is richies okay every flights to europe costs a tons,LABEL_1

last year i did a 8 hour budget airline flight on norse from berlin to newark and honestly it was fine the movies were free the plane was brand new the legroom was fine certainly no worse than a regular airline the only thing i had to pay for was a meal which was dollar20 and honestly kinda tasty but considering the ticket was dollar289  it was well worth it ,LABEL_2
i sat on a short kul sin flight on scoot in an exit row and it felt never ending mind you i would love to try this ,LABEL_2

wow that was a cheap cheap flight,LABEL_2

i stay max 6 houers in basic economy class great work,LABEL_2
i went to australia and back for less than euros600 with this airline on this route if all you want is to get from point a to point b then its perfect it is simply a long haul ryanair thank you scoot for making worldwide travel available for everyone also the same route with other carriers was at least double the price so not worth it for just some unnecessary luxury extras ,LABEL_2
if i could get one of the recliner seats for less than economy on a full service airline i would definitely fly with them if that was not an option it would have to be cheap enough that i could still buy things like meals and an aisle seat for significan notly less money hundreds of dollars less than others ,LABEL_2
no tv on bord it is low cost but 12 h they can add tv,LABEL_1

i would consider myself as a price conscious traveler but i think low cost on a long haul flight is something i would not be willing to do thanks for providing this excellent honest review,LABEL_1
if the price is right i would fly with scoot i would definitely consider upgrading to that scoot in silence cabin extra legroom seats private cabin and like david mentioned adjustable headrests the one on the 787 8 is particularly good i am waiting for an opportunity to try it myself the ground service is where the airline falls down on bad days so that is one thing to consider too ,LABEL_2

i flew scoot from sydney to singapore nice clean efficient plane baggage allowance was good but that is it so you take a book or an ipad or try to sleep i could even put up with their over priced food but the problem is the food is terrible if they are going to rip you off for the food they could at least serve something decent apparently scoot is known for their awful food ,LABEL_0
do not expect much from a budget airlines lovely airlines but but but a lot of buts ,LABEL_0
i have flown scoot on several occasions now more recently from perth to singapore with a connector to penang last week i was able to select my seat but pay for it i selected seat 44a which did recline and the extra space next to me was great i arrived in singapore 12am with the next flight departing 9am so i feel your pain to ease things i booked into the plaza lounge sdollar80 which was over priced over crowded the food was terrible bar closed and i could not sleep as one guy was snoring keeping everyone else awake at least he got some sleep the only good thing was the shower which was well worth the wait definitely not worth the money not sure if it is due to covid i personally do not think so but the overall scoot service and onboard catering is terrible in addition my booking was duplicated due to a processing glitch and was told by the cs agent that i would incur a sdollar50 fee for a refund common sense prevailed after a vigorous discussion and getting her to check with a supervisor i was advised a fee would not be charged but the refund would take 6 8 weeks i still have another month to wait for a refund also i had to send an email to cancel the duplicated booking a week after they told me it was cancelled still no written response to my email totally disappointed with their overall performance it seems to have really gone downhill  not a great way to start a relaxing holiday ,LABEL_1
i have had several scoot flights all of them were great value e g singapore berlin direct flight for 158euros back in 2018 our seats has always been assigned together regarding the food it is always expensive in the airplanes simply bring your own food by now they do have board entertainment which you can access with your phone flying with a low cost airline with having so many expectations is ridiculous,LABEL_2

there was once i took scoot from singapore to thailand my family got the seats at the back and we were able to sit all apart to look at the view ,LABEL_2
air asia is the low cost king ,LABEL_2
so i took them once from melbourne to jaipur except that a month out from the flight i got an email saying that my ticket was cancelled from singapore to jaipur because they no longer were serving that route the options were a reroute or refund of that leg which would take 12 weeks i think it was i am not sure why airlines take that long to refund your money possibly they hope you will choose a different option in the end i just flew to kl from singapore and took air asia to jaipur the process of the reroute took hours and hours on the phone trying to work it out and just as long waiting for the call to be answered i did still fly scoot to singapore though on the dreamliner in what they called iscootbiz at the time it was a large seat and meals were included although i already had paid for the meal i big dollar150 to upgrade which was the lowest they allowed and i was surprised to find i won the seat but i slept and it was comfortable the cabin crew were not that friendly i remember that air asia for all its faults i like in as much as the staff are usually super friendly and welcoming the same could not be said for scoot i feel like they staffed it by demoting staff who didnt hit kpis on singapore airlines and were not happy about it great vid as always josh ,LABEL_0
singapore to bali i think the best is still klm in terms of price and come with full service ,LABEL_2
it was like dollar10us for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice that is not a bad price at all for a meal in the sky ,LABEL_2
i flew scoot in business class back in 2018 it was an okay flight now screen so i was happy i had my big ipad with me tho when on board it was really cold and travelling from one warm country to another i did not bring a jacket with me into the plane from singapore to japan and i was freezing so bad for 5 hours the flight crew could only help me with a cup of warm water which helped a bit but the plane being icy cold that was really bad of them not to have blankets especially for business class the food was averrage so no complaints the only think was the heating otherwise nice crew and really nice view i do not hate on them at all just think they should have blankets on board for long flights that are over 6 hours ,LABEL_0
how is silk air ,LABEL_1
i took scoot from singapore to taiwan about 5 hours the experience was not so bad at least the seat was quite comfortable better than other budget flight so service is good service to me the air crews leave me alone in the entire journey proper friendly was not included how nice ,LABEL_2

i hv to admit that scoot has the widest seat space in budget airlines ,LABEL_2
worth it when i paid sgd 580 for jakarta singapore berlin return also personally i find scoot is food a lot better than many other budget airlines eg air asia jetstar so the price is justified ,LABEL_2

mate you are the only youtuber that only seems to have negative experiences you expect 5 star singapore airlines style service on their budget carrier scoot is cheap for a reason and dollar11 for seat selection is very reasonable for a lcc ,LABEL_1

i am going to fly from singapore to berlin in april and i do not really care for anything special because i paid 180euros for my ticket so what would i expect if i want to eat 3 meals drink 4 beverages and book a seat it will still be cheaper than flying singapore airlines,LABEL_1

i have always enjoyed watching your reviews very constructive and honest  then you said you like watching liverpool fc that justput you to the very top of my favourite travel vlogger hands up ynwa ,LABEL_2
hi josh air asia is the total package great crews great fares vegetarian food that puts some mainline carriers like sq to shame not targetting singapore airlines but when booking their flights to athens berlin et al beware these sq flights are operated by scoot bad form esp if paying sq fare qantas does the same opaque marketing of flights meaning you could end up on jetstar a case of once bitten twice shy ,LABEL_0
if u travel with friends or family on scoot actually do not have to pay dollar11 for the seats it will be automatically assigned together as long as all of them are checked in together it happens to me quite a number of times ,LABEL_1
yeah low cost but if you add the extras nothing special,LABEL_1

you should be careful about what you say i have travelled with scoot as well and it is a good airline you said that the seats were comfortable and the crew was good you have great expectations from a budget airline need some extra comfort kindly pay for it ,LABEL_2
you could have spent time in cinema and swimming pool in the airport,LABEL_1
great content josh ,LABEL_2
review doesnt start until 6 minutes into the video,LABEL_1
people are still wearing short jeans ,LABEL_1
are you allowed to bring your own food on board ,LABEL_1
even united does that kind of thing with the seat selection on the lowest fare most ridiculous on scoot is that you need to pay for the power socket or did they change it in asia i prefer airasia the food is quiet decent and fairly priced in my option ,LABEL_1
rating cleaners is so nice i always appreciate those hard working people at busy airports ,LABEL_2
have a nice time in singapur,LABEL_2
you should also mention that they will also need it if they are going to china,LABEL_1
liverpool yeah ,LABEL_1
please review thai airways i am waiting for your review then i will book my tickets on it business class of 777 200 300 ,LABEL_1
 4 41 that is what you call dedication to vlogging,LABEL_1
airasia x the best lcc,LABEL_2
josh you are lfc fans so great so lovely  ,LABEL_2
the videi quilety was good but the airline is so worst to traveler with out intertentment he heh ehe,LABEL_0
picking and choosing your assigned seat is a business in itself these days ,LABEL_1
they charge dollar5 for a glass of water ,LABEL_1
josh i like that you fly all the different classes on the airlines and are not afraid to admit when you have a positive experience in economy or a negative experience in business or first class it gives me a much better picture of what different airlines are like i suffer from spinal spondylosis and am confined to a wheelchair i recently had a heart attack but doctors tell me i may return to the air in the spring japan and singapore are on my bucket list of places to visit my dad is retired navy and he especially loved singapore he tells me it is so beautiful there would you be able to recommend any airlines that are kind to the physically handicapped i belong to delta is sky rewards so i tend to be partial to someone who partners with delta as delta takes very good care of me do not know if that makes a difference or not your wisdom would be greatly appreciated thanks ,LABEL_2
great  proper review thankyou ur all videos are good ,LABEL_2
nice video,LABEL_2
you should try jetstar 787 economy which is good for 2 3 hour flights not for 8 hours,LABEL_2
my guy supports liverpool ynwa,LABEL_2
absolutely enjoyed your videos,LABEL_2
i have taken scoot both regional and long haul regional is to penang and bangkok and that is about the limit of my endurance for a 28 seat pitch if we are checking in luggage a mainline flight is preferable sing or thai if it is to bangkok because with the luggage fees added in it is often really close in price on long haul it was narita to bangkok don meuang at the time and we did scoot business far more comfortable and it included a meal and something to drink the seat was more like a mainline premium economy seat than a true business class seat but as it was a daytime flight that was fine we will be doing scoot biz from narita to sing in november the flight was significan notly lower in price than any mainline airline it is an lcc so i set my expectations accordingly are they great no but they generally get me to where i am going with a minimum of inconvience ,LABEL_2
great as always ,LABEL_2
i am on scoot is neo in economy to bali next april after arriving on sq a350 in premium but it is only 2hrs 40mins so it is not to bad ,LABEL_2
love your walk through the flight the meal did look a little bland you do a good explanation of your flights very intertaining ,LABEL_2
thanks,LABEL_1
what a girly voice,LABEL_2
good share ,LABEL_2
thank you for your review jayden your reviews are always so informative and helpful honestly as a singaporean having the same sentiment as u if i can fly by other airlines i will if i have to take scoot the flight will not be more than 2 hours for me or no other choice which i really doubt scoot is standard has dropped quite drastically ever since they amerged with tiger airways and has been dropping ,LABEL_2
we just flew scoot this march april ool coolangatta via sin to ho chi minh city sgn vietnam price was just over dollar2 4k return for 3 of us i am certain they stuffed our meals up dollar53 aud for 2 rolls w drink and small chicken meal the flight attendant was not going to budge when i questioned i am sure there more  return home last thursday we took our own snacks as did quite a few others on all flights  not sure if we will use them next time probably vietjet direct brisbane to saigon or singapore airlines have also flown air asia x 5 times and their meals are way better for similar price  ,LABEL_1
my wifey you do not need much room because i can get your ankles behind your ears ,LABEL_1
their airfares are only cheap if you do not have checked in luggage and do not need food add in the lack of entertainment and the cramped conditions medium to long haul flights on budget airlines are often poor value ,LABEL_0
please get medicine for your cat is eye infection unless you already have tended to her interesting trip information i have always had to fly economy but these days i do not know that it is worth it ,LABEL_0
i am gonna go ahead and help you with the algorithm by providing a coat hoooook time stamp 15 00 ,LABEL_1

i fly from berlin to singapore this is my first time with scoot and the last time they hunting low cost traverel for cheap price but unfortunetly the fly ticket not include anything also they not allow you brig your own food or dring onboard so you must all from over priced menu when i caluculate all after fly its the same price like fly with qatar with full servis include teribble experience with scoot,LABEL_0
what an experience sam thanks for bringing us onboard to give us viewers a better insight kudos to all the hardworking scoot crew really looking forward to my scoot flight to hong kong real soon now ,LABEL_2
the best review ever thanks sam chui,LABEL_2
love it sam ,LABEL_2
you are very friendly and lovely guy ,LABEL_2
nice bro ,LABEL_2
best budget airline  great to see how you look after customer quality service equipment,LABEL_2
you are inspirational sam i would just love to try being cabin crew for a day i think being cabin crew on a low cost airline is much more demanding than full service ,LABEL_2
i hope you do lots more of these videos behind the scenes is so interesting we as passengers do not see great vid my best from yul,LABEL_2
any feedback from the scoot is customer taking singapore laksa ,LABEL_1
sam a awesome youtube footage we enjoyed it tremendously thanks my friend ,LABEL_2
that was a great addition sam but my only trouble budget airlines should not ask passengers to pay for the food service it should be provided and delivered to the passenger is seat but this is a budget airline for short haul flights scoot is different and the crew is wonderful including the senior staff congratulations sam you did well you need to work on your landings though namaste brother ,LABEL_2
he is doing it for a low cost airline,LABEL_1
scoot is pretty good the check in staff see i am not good on the kiosk but as always scoot staff see this and come and help the cabin crew make you feel so comfortable and at ease the food is still a bit ordinary though have a couple flights coming up in may so look forward to it they do it tough up there and passengers should appreciate them more ,LABEL_2

787th like ,LABEL_1
interesting insights i am wondering if the flight despatchers are trained solely by the airlines on the job or if they have to obtain a certification from national aviation authorities the cabin crew come across really well here scoot i would give them a try ,LABEL_2

great bro cool always healthy greetings,LABEL_2
that is great bro it is just appeared right ,LABEL_2
thank you for sharing ,LABEL_2
nice video mate just two questions which hotel did you stay in singapore and what area also did scoot offer you an upgrade to scoot plus via email or when checking in and if so how much extra was the upgrade that was an expensivie return flight to aus probably could have bought a return ticket with qantas for that much and gained qff points as well jetstar also flies from melbourne to singapore since scoot do not fly there perhaps worth a try next time ,LABEL_2
nice one thanks for sharing i am very keen to try scoot between sydney and singapore hopefully sometime next year so many places to visit just not enough holidays away from work it is a bit annoying when they control the tint on the windows ,LABEL_2
nice video bro ,LABEL_2
they did you can clearly see them take cell phones pictures to post on reddit for karma in that picture it is kind of a redditception reddit post of a reddit post ,LABEL_1
i never had fees for carryon or checked luggage service was prompt planes were nice on the inside if barebones nothing glaringly awful that they could control crying babies for 15 minutes before landing do not count i dunno did not particularly mind them lccs in the us are worse ,LABEL_0
yeah i flew scoot on a hop to bali from sg they use the 78 for capacity reasons,LABEL_1
it is too bad i like this aircraft ,LABEL_0
nice from where to where are you flying,LABEL_1
why spend money on painting the plane when you are a discount airline just use that money to improve your service ,LABEL_1
i think it is more quiet especially when taxiing when i took the dreamliner i sat right over the wings and i thought it was smoother and more quiet especially vs the 747 400 or the 77w the engine noise is noticeable ,LABEL_2
fedex names all their planes after employee is children,LABEL_0
