Everything on board is apparently expensive üò¢. But the flight fee quite low. If they aren‚Äôt,I will choose regular airlines>>><<<Now there&#39;s none of Scoot flight from Berlin to Singapore üò¢>>><<<Max 5hrs and its already a torture>>><<<Btw how much is this flight? I&#39;ll check for mere curiosity>>><<<Here&#39;s a cookie bro, no but no thank you...>>><<<Definitely not for me. Not long haul flights anyway.

I don&#39;t care about it, but it stops the people in front of me from reclining into my space!>>><<<I remember back in the day the entertainment was only a few channels on the onboard radio,,, and the middle area would have a movie running on the big screen for everyone to watch.. they could at least get this back on these low cost airlines?>>><<<It&#39;s  a budget airline. What do you expect. If you want full amenities then pay extra duh?!!>>><<<5 hours>>><<<a parcel on a cargo plane gets treated better than a Scoot economy class passenger>>><<<13 hours no movie set &amp; pillow &amp; blanket I don‚Äôt take it but it‚Äôs good still thanks for the video>>><<<Max is 4 hrs>>><<<techincally, we are paying for the food and drinks on a normal flight. so it&#39;s not &quot;free&quot;>>><<<I have flown Scoot on SIN-SYD (8.5 hours) for a few times now and been thankful every time. I am a huge cheapo so I almost never pay for add-ons to my ticket EXCEPT for 80mb of wifi. I do tend to pack light so I just use my cabin luggage. (Unlike some American airlines, Scoot overhead bins are never full). Scoot is good in allowing up to 10kg for cabin luggage. Although Scoot claims that the 10kg allowance is for both cabin luggage and personal item, I‚Äôve never encountered a counter staff demanding to weigh my personal item. So yeah if you have something super heavy, put it in your personal item instead of your cabin luggage while at the counter lol. (You can always slip it into cabin luggage later)<br><br>I have found that reading up on what Scoot offers and preparing accordingly, is the best way to take advantage of the good prices. For example you mention that the price of water is expensive, which is true, but also most people bring empty water bottles (you are allowed to bring up to 1L containers) which they fill up at the water coolers after getting past security checks. That should resolve a lot of your hydration issues. Regarding food I‚Äôve noticed that most people do buy food from Scoot which is fine, but again you can either pack your own food/snacks from home, or buy them at the airport. Entertainment can easily be solved by pre-downloading shows to watch on your phone/tablet and you can even download shows while waiting to board at the airport! For the older folks most of them brought along a book. For power bring your own battery pack. Please don‚Äôt be that person who spends 8 hours in the flight watching videos on your phone only to realise that your battery is now low.<br><br>As a 160cm (5‚Äô3‚Äù) person, I don‚Äôt have issues with legroom, although I did recently buy a footrest hammock which was incredible and helped me sleep 6 hours on an 8.5 hour flight! Bring your own neck pillow if you like those, and it‚Äôs always good to have an extra jacket and/or scarf to keep warm since the cabin can get quite cold.<br><br>In all honesty, in my opinion flying Scoot rewards people who are familiar with how airports/airlines work, and prepares in advance for any needs they might have‚Ä¶ and punishes people who fail to plan. If you need to check in luggage, it‚Äôs around 30SGD when you purchase early‚Ä¶ if you check in luggage at the airport, it costs 110SGD which is insane. Don‚Äôt fall into that trap! If you‚Äôre a traveller who plans well though, Scoot is definitely a great option. I find the seats comfortable, flight crew friendly, and of course great price!>>><<<great videos, always wonder how you shoot the hyperlapses and timelapses in airport, do you need permission from airport security or authorities?>>><<<According to their policy, consumption of outside food and beverages are not allowed on board though‚Ä¶.>>><<<They competing with ryanair for worst seats>>><<<I took this exact route in 2019. Will do it again if the price is right. <br><br>The cons were that you need to bring at least a serving of food and water to make the price worthwhile. Don&#39;t forget to bring your own blanket, pillow, and entertainment. Food, though edible, were not good.>>><<<I‚Äôd rather do greyhound>>><<<I dont care, tape me to yhe ceiling üòÇüòÇ just mske the flight cheap>>><<<welp im still flying this to Langkawi on their A320...>>><<<I flew with Scoot from Singapore to Chiang Mai. The attendant did not allow me to eat the burger I bought from Singapore I.A 7/11 store. That was very unfriendly for me. I seriously starved for almost 4 hours during that flight. So when I landed in Chiang Mai IA, I hurriedly grabbed my burger so I could regain my energy. They should change that very unfavorable policy.>>><<<I was on that same flight last year. But from Singapore to Berlin, before flying back to home. I went to Melbourne as well. Also with Scoot. Been there with Jetsar and Finnair. Overall, still same to me. Long flights are never fun, until you arrive.  But also at the same time. Very fond memories. So it did bring me back for sure :D&lt;3>>><<<brave man>>><<<bro my guy was on scoot for 1 hours when i could not even survive 3>>><<<Just give me enough oxygen so I can be unconscious the entire flight but still alive at my destination>>><<<2.5 hours only üòÇ>>><<<It&#39;s not that bad for Scoot. I took a economy flight from Singapore to Jakarta and the service was great, the food was good and you could even buy a Scoot &#39;Pikachu Jet&#39; model with the Pokemon livery.>>><<<Good luck with the injections>>><<<water in Singapore is much more expensive than Beer üòÇ>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=84">1:24</a> Yeah, tell that to Malpensa airport.>>><<<The silent cabin is amazing. i would pay and arm and a leg to remove kids from planes. those fuckers dont need intl air travel and anyone bringing a crying baby onto a plane should be labelled a terrorist. 7 hours HK to Sydney. imagine.>>><<<If you think the water price is expensive then maybe dont fly to Singapore :D>>><<<nice trip and nice plane spotting video üëç>>><<<7 hrs>>><<<Oh gosh, did you see a doctor after the flight? üòÖüòÖ>>><<<Will Scoot flight attendants lock the dimmable window settings?>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=341">5:41</a> Auf Wiedersehen Berlin!>>><<<Scoot lost my Armani coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and they refused to compensate for the loss. I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.<br><br>In summary, AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.>>><<<I think 5 hours max>>><<<disgusting ewwww>>><<<Typical german guy ziemlicher beta male guy mit ner jeans auf nem 12 stunden flight und wurstfinger>>><<<FCK BERLIN LITRALLY the worst town in germany>>><<<AX much better...smarter leadership>>><<<I took a flight from Taipei(TPE) to Moscow in 2014. There was no entertainment but they provided food. The flight was about 11 hours, so I brought a book on the plane. But now I will take the typical economy class if I fly more than 6 hours.>>><<<That looks like hell üòÇ>>><<<Are the crew members called &quot;Scooters&quot;>>><<<13h ohne Bordunterhaltung üòÆüòÆüòÆ>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=134">2:14</a> as TR_<i>__</i>>>><<<Honestly, nothing more than 6 hours. Unless there is wifi<br><br>Also, I feel like only Asian old like this flight>>><<<can you bring bottled water on flight? I really dont want to pay for water...>>><<<To this day the worst airline I‚Äôve ever flown. I did two round trips between Tokyo and Singapore in 2022 on Scoot, about eight hours long. And both times I had just the most rude crew, and overall a truly unpleasant experience. Plus they really do come down on you for the smallest things. I had a candy bar I was eating from the Changi Airport 7-Eleven that the flight attendant snatched out of my hand because ‚Äúno food from outside the plane is allowed‚Äù. Similarly, they don‚Äôt let you wear headphones during taxi, takeoff, and landing, which did not help my anxieties about takeoff/landing at all. Zero stars, I‚Äôll gladly pay more to never deal with them again. Spirit had better service ü§ê>>><<<Thanks for reviewing so that we don&#39;t have to suffer. Indigo Follow the same model or much worse. 531 seats in B777. If i were the head of any regulatory agency i would not have approved such flights. This is good for short people. Anyone who is above 190CM in height will suffer in this.>>><<<1 hour max....>>><<<2 hours>>><<<I flew with Norwegian on one of their narrow-body aircraft CPH/DXB back when they used to fly it. 6+hrs in that seat was really tough, as both were night flights. No entertainment, no food or water unless you paid, no pillows, no blankets, reclined approx 3deg (maybe), no comforts what so ever. Never again. It was like trying to sleep on a local bus seat. I only flew it to fit into a client&#39;s budget for the job, but will not do that again. They don&#39;t fly that route anymore. No surprises really when Emirates was slightly more expensive but you get everything.>>><<<HOW DO YOU SURVIVE, respect>>><<<Come on, water should be free on flights. In come Indigo!!!>>><<<So i supppose ‚Ç¨20 more one way with free water, more tasty food and free power outlets would make this &quot;not bad at all&quot;. I&#39;d die in those seats though. Almost 2m and kinda wide at the shoulders. If i got the isle seat in any economy people bump into my shoulders let alone the stewardesses with their little carts ;)>>><<<I watched this to get an idea on Scoot, because I have been seeing this option via Athens and Singapore while looking for SE Asia flights from Istanbul. I don‚Äôt mind at all. I had actually boarded an India Railways 3rd class overnight train, spending the night on something that can be counted as a park bench. Though the silence option without babies is a win for me.>>><<<Hav question who fly route berlin-bkk, stop in Athen 1hr, just stay in the same airplane? No need to get off right? Are there many late &amp; cancelation happened frequently? I really not sure, but price for the other airline are super crazy...>>><<<Glad to know they have seat power outlets, but what about internet?>>><<<Plus how early do u get to the airport???>>><<<5h bro from Singapore Changi International Airport To Xian Xianyang International Airport on a Scoot A320neo>>><<<Umm you could have always used Sch√∂nefeld airport instead of Tegel and could have gone by train to Sch√∂nefeld for decades üòÇ now you‚Äôre taking the same train to BER üòÇ>>><<<Having watched the video, I really hope I‚Äôd never have to.>>><<<For most of my life, I have travelled with low-cost airlines/low-cost subsidiaries, where flights were only 2 hours long, but 12 hours on a low-cost?? I&#39;d definitely not do that, because a fews hours is good enough only.>>><<<I always have this rule, that if the flight will be more than 5 hours, I will never ever fly low-cost, regardless of their price offer.>>><<<NEW PLANE Bƒ∞G PLANE BUT NO IFE,HEADRESTS,FOOTRESTS,  GOOD MEALS, BLANKET AND Pƒ∞LLOW <br>ONLY ƒ∞N SCOOTüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ>>><<<EA airlines üòÇ>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot Biz twice from Europe - Australia, the only plus is the seat and good legroom.

You don&#39;t have to buy, but they only give you a small amount each time.>>><<<Fill your water bottle from tap after security, all 2 litres for free>>><<<I&#39;ve no hesitation in flying Scoot. Good value, excellent aircraft (Dreamliner), good crew, always on time for flights I&#39;ve taken. Plus Singapore Kris Flyer points.>>><<<Babies should be banned from airlines....period>>><<<The &quot;Silence&quot; section sounds like a really good option for such a long haul flight. Curious how much more it costs (I just tried on their website, but did not want to go too far, so didn&#39;t find out).>>><<<Ahh Scoot ... The airline that dares you to change your booking, as it costs less buying a new ticket than changing your flight date. In all honesty, its the biggest rip off airline I ever flew>>><<<The seats are terrible. That was my main issue. I couldnt sleep on an 11hr +7hr flights and return.too and had back and back and neck pain after.>>><<<Its too dissapointing to have no IFE>>><<<Under those conditions I would say 4 hours max>>><<<I would do max 6 - 8 hours>>><<<I was watching this on a flight and thought the PA was on my plane lol>>><<<I say 5 hours on wow air from Baltimore to Reykjavik>>><<<Next September I will be flying with Singapore Airline from Frankfurt to Indonesia via Singapore and it costs only for 740 euros with baggage allowance 30 Kgs. I would never fly with low cost carrier if I had long flight. It is not worth it at all. Only +100 euros and you will enjoy your flight with unlimitied wifi, foods, etc>>><<<At last !!!!!! Someone who does a review of cattle class !!! Great to see !!!>>><<<Lol try Melbourne to London with Scoot and 18 hour layover Singapore Airport>>><<<lots of empty seats to grab>>><<<Wow, unbelievable, I also flew the 9V-OFI last year! I did ATH SIN BKK. <br>I had some downloaded media on my devices, packed some snacks and purchased lunch beforehand in the app. Honestly loved the experience, for 200 usd!>>><<<I really like the brutally honest series, keep the great work.>>><<<The MAX is 3 hrs>>><<<I did the Athens Singapore flight. They offered movies via a iPad-like device.>>><<<This year in March the Scoot flight economy cost as much as Singapore airlines economy did last year for the same trip. Not really a cheap cost anymore, but still cheap quality. Two hours with Scoot was enough for me‚Ä¶>>><<<My longest flight on a low-cost-carrier was with Wizzair from Brussels, Belgium to Abu Dhabi, UAE. It was 6 hours and 20 minutes in their a321NX. The price was great and the food tastet suprisingly fine in contrast to Ryanair. You can pre-order meals or buy beverages and snacks at the airport. The cabin was also extremely quiet so it made it rly easy to sleep. It wasn&#39;t that bad as I expected. I&#39;d enjoyed the flight even if the legroom was... no comment. It wasn&#39;t rly that bad so imma fly low-cost-cariers more frequent now :)>>><<<well i flew long haul non budget airlines and all i wanna do is sleep. tbh, youd only spend an hour on the entertainment. what is more impt to me is a spotify playlist hahaha>>><<<5 hrs max>>><<<You sound like John De Lancie aka &#39;Q&#39; from Star Trek The Next Generation>>><<<Last summer I did 15 hours in an A350 (both ways)...in Economy. Not fun,but I survived.>>><<<5 hrs 30 mins from Qatar to Budapest on a basic economy class 3 3 seat plane. Will never do that again lol. I still got a meal, pillow, blanket, and tv, but the legroom is just too small. I once flew using Jetstar from Singapore to Perth but luckily I bought a seat in the first row. I think I could still survive without pillow and blanket, but I need decent space for my legs during long flights.>>><<<No tv ?>>><<<being 203 cms id die in these seats>>><<<I flew with Scoot from Singapore to Athens and I wasn‚Äôt feeling good on my return trip and asked for water, my bank card wasn‚Äôt working and I had no cash, I literally had to plea with them to allow me to get water from the tap where the staff drink, it took me at least 30 minutes until they let me fill up a cup of water even though I told them I wasn‚Äôt feeling great, staff later told me that every bottle water is counted for and if there is discrepancies staff will be punished, that‚Äôs why they only let me fill up a cup and not give me bottle water. I would still travel with them however to save huge $$$, but don‚Äôt expect free water if you are feeling sick. üò∂üò∂>>><<<I will spend anytime in a low cost airline at least there is entertainment in the airline app>>><<<im on scoot last February Singapore to  Cebu  4 hours ha! try 10 stuck on the ground in Philippines I don&#39;t know where?  sit here don&#39;t change seats ? in plane order ? i can see the plane out the window . given water  back on the same plane sit anywhere ? maybe they will be good one day>>><<<We flew Scoot from Sydney to Singapore in 2022. Take off was delayed by 2 hours, thank got my husband got 2 sandwiches and Pringle&#39;s chips from the airport. We were served &quot;Mum&#39;s fried rice&quot;, it was not even heated properly and portion is extremely small. I asked for a coffee and water, not knowing it would be served with a tablet to pay AUD $15.00, it was the worst coffee(again not warm enough, and I know airplane coffee tastes bad, but this was worst). We knew we got the tickets for cheap and it was a budget airlines, but man, was it bad. We should&#39;ve found out more before booking. After reaching Singapore, I told my husband, if he ever booked this airlines, I&#39;m leaving him üòÇ>>><<<My daughter just did Melbourne to Athens via Singapore on Scoot.  Due to a very long layover in Singapore and delays the flight took 31 hours!  She said the worst part was waiting 12 hours overnight at Changing airport>>><<<Scoot is not really cheap for a budget carrier. If you are willing to top up a bit you may fly with a normal carrier and get food, water, entertainment.>>><<<Scoot is really good. You just need to have your expectations to a bare minimum. I agree with you, the meals are really awful. Keep a big bottle of water with you and a book on hand.>>><<<If you can‚Äôt afford air travel at a reasonable price, why travel in the first place?>>><<<They could charge the water into your fare and give it to you free.>>><<<a job>>><<<From personal experience, Scoot is as awful as its sister company, Singapore Airlines is great!>>><<<Since I reached a really good level in my career woth a good salary I pay lovely for business to have really good confort, a good sleep and meal for fligths over 7 hours. Everything below I can survive in eco bit longer, I earn the money, I soend it.>>><<<5.5 hrs  flight to Perth from Singapore , never again>>><<<No way to travel üòÇüòÇ>>><<<This was a living Hell. Scoot was invented by the Devil to torture human beings.>>><<<Pretty shocking about the water. Comfort aside, that is a passenger safety issue. A lack of water can cause thrombosis, and the complications of thrombosis can be a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Price-savings aside, airlines should be required to do the minimum to make sure that their passengers will not be endangered during flights.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=123">2:03</a> boah fuck alter üòÇ>>><<<Flew with Scoot from Sydney to SG.

Once you add in luggage it is cheaper to fly a normal airline.  Just a totally pointless exercise as far as I can see.  Basically a scam.>>><<<It&#39;s is scoot air Boeing 787>>><<<This is just dehumanising üò¢>>><<<3-4 hours. I&#39;d never try to save some money flying longhaul on this airline, Zip Air of Japan seems to be much more generous and will try them but Scoot, no thanks.>>><<<You should try Cebu Pacific flight Manila-Dubai on their A330-900 high density configuration. No entertainment screen and seat pitch for short Asian people. Even 8h30 min. is terrible.>>><<<I recently did a return trip on this exact route. Wifi was bad, and I was completely board all the way. üò¢. On the bright side, I flew business class, where there are actually power points to charge up electrical items.>>><<<Scoot is not cheap at all.

Probably the loneliest flight ever.>>><<<Bro should be knighted for taking this flight üòÇ<br><br>Personally though, I won&#39;t hop in an LCC for more than 4 hours since I will need food, drinks, maybe charging my phone which eventually comes close to full service airlines in terms of cost.>>><<<Those amenities are literally the same as you would experience flying long-haul, full-fare Economy on a major flag carrier like Lufthansa, British Airways etc back in the 70&#39;s &amp; 80&#39;s; no screens, power outlets or adjustable headrests back then either (had to deal with cigarette smoke in the cabin as well) and the same crappy microwave-quality meals to boot.  The difference of course being that the full-fare you paid back then would have been many thousands of Euros in todays money, rather than only the 300-odd Euros that Scoot charges for the same thing.  As the man says, you get what you pay for...>>><<<wau, no headrests and non reclinable seats?! I am a budget traveller, but I could not do it without it on such a long flight>>><<<Look at the bright side 40 years ago your wifi was a skymall magazine and inflight entertainment was turbulence so its still the same>>><<<like, 5-6hrs at most. and that&#39;s a fairly reluctant 5-6hr at that. usually i try to fly delta, if not that then american. at least domestically. long haul i avoid low cost.>>><<<This is the first Airline I have seen that did not give water for free, I have been flying since early 90&#39;s, over 2 million miles worth.>>><<<I would say the best thing about scoot is they run flights from Singapore to a lot of smaller cities (at least in Asia) which would otherwise need transferring. I&#39;m more than ok to suffer a bit if flying with them saves me a day. Furthermore, I can always pay a little bit extra for the more spacious seats and all the other services, they are not that expensive given that the ticket itself is cheap.>>><<<I actually took that flight, awful exp√©rience but the price is great>>><<<No scoot for me. Thank you.>>><<<Video is great ..NOT recommended this airline specially long tirp ..>>><<<Just try Ryanair in Europe... 5 mn is already too long.

Same 3-3-3 configuration, only major difference is in-flight entertainment and a mediocre TV dinner>>><<<Thank you for this helpful video!>>><<<Last year I flew MVD-GRU-MVD with Latam, an airline formed by the amalgamation of the erstwhile excellent Lan Chile and TAM brazil. The bare bones economy without seat choice checked or even carry on for this 488 mile trip was ¬£505. The seat I was allocated at check in was the back row without recline or window. Thankfully, the passenger in front did not see the need to recline on this short hop. That makes Scoot seem rather good value.>>><<<Scoot changed my CEB-SIN flight without notice - making it 2 hours earlier. Got to the airpirt and no flight.  I was flying CEB-LHR on Luftansa. Amazingly,  Scoot blamed Lufthansa for the flight time change.  Luckily, I was moved to Singapore Airlines. For LCCs, I&#39;d fly Cebu Pacific instead.>>><<<I like the idea of taking out all the baked in costs and presenting them to the consumer to choose what they actually want.  I only fly like 3 hour domestic U.S. flights and don&#39;t need power, data, or entertainment.>>><<<I flew from Melbourne to Singapore a month ago and saw in the first row behind the silent area. It was the best flying experience I ever had. The other rows felt tight and I def wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.>>><<<i once did a 13.5 hour flight from KL to London on low cost airline (AirAsia), and it was actually one of the most pleasant flights i&#39;ve ever taken! ( i&#39;ve flown 225 times).>>><<<322 Euro is not a cheap price for a one way ticket.>>><<<Hot<br>Or>>><<<I might be able to sit in economy class for maybe 2 - 3 hours, max. I cannot sleep on a regular air line seat - going 13 hours in a fetal position would drive me over the edge!>>><<<3hrs>>><<<Thank you for your review of long haul flight with Scoot.  Honestly, after viewing your video, I would avoid Scoot for long haul or ultra-long haul flights if possible.  <br>     I‚Äôve flown ultra-long haul economy with other airlines, between Toronto,  Canada and Asia. And their service was much better. Meals and charge power and In Flight Entertainment System and amenities pouch included in the price. <br>      Thank you for the videos.>>><<<Thanks for the video. Low price is perfectly OK on shorter trips, but NOT on long trips like this. Next month I&#39;m going on holiday to Thailand (from Scandinavia). Then I take Finnair down and Emirates back (economy class). My holiday already starts with the flight, which should be comfortable, and I&#39;m willing to pay for that.>>><<<All you have to do is ask them to fill up your water bottle, it&#39;s free.>>><<<Scoot is crap and Air Asia is light years ahead - I have flown both, even Scoot Biz class and it still is the poor cousin to its Malay neighbour.>>><<<There&#39;s power! only 8-9 eur.  Psftt. that&#39;s nothing man,<br><br>Food is not that crazy expensive either.>>><<<I&#39;d do this purely for the baby-free section.....>>><<<Flown Scoot many times and they&#39;ve always been reliable. Happy to tough it out and save a few hundred $$$.  Use the money you save to stay an extra couple of nights, or to do something special. Bring an empty water bottle (or two) to fill up after security, bring snacks, bring a power bank, and download a few movies/TV shows and it&#39;s basically the same as any other flight.>>><<<Did just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=270">4:30</a>h from Stuttgart to Hurghada. Kids on plane should be banned ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è>>><<<As a Malaysian, that Nasi Lemak for ‚Ç¨6.50 was a fucking crime.>>><<<Even though I travel always on budget, I am glad that I have enough money to not need to consider taking Scoot for long haul flights. Travelling on budget and being cheap (or low on money)  are 2 different things anyway üòÑ>>><<<That‚Äôs how we economem travel. ‚ù§>>><<<I‚Äôm always looking at the cost but I‚Äôm way to big to wanna spend 13 hours in that seat>>><<<Now I finally get when people are complaining about airline food. That looks disgusting. If any airline would ever serve me anything close to that, I&#39;ll never fly with them again. And best of luck with getting a rest before arriving, barely acceptable level of (dis)comfort for upto 2h flights. Saving cash is good but not at any cost.>>><<<I always bring my own food, water and warm items, + powerbank, so it would be worth it if i ever want to use their routes. So long as the seats aren&#39;t harder than other airlines, i&#39;m good! Actually the option of booking in a silent area is awesome, i haven&#39;t seen that before.>>><<<Just bought a one-way ticket from Tokyo to Singapore for end-year flight from Scoot. It will be my first. Bought it on discount but at around 200 SGD, with 25kg checked bags? I will be willing to bear abit rougher 6 hours for almost a third of the price of comparable Singapore Airlines flight. I always brought a powerbank, ipad mini, and headphone anyway. <br><br>And yes, I agree that Air Asia‚Äôs in-flight offerings are probably the only LCC‚Äôs food offering you can consider. Its abit cheaper too to boot. Jetstar and Scoot is basically same level for me.>>><<<Scoot is good LCC. You should have tried Jetstar in Australia, I can guarantee a day later you still in the departure airport‚Ä¶>>><<<Cheap longhaul travel will always fulfill a need.>>><<<Can do 13 hrs standing on my head. Anything else is a bonus..as long as it&#39;s cheap enough.>>><<<Dont forget to grab some empty bottle<br>Fill it with water at the airport>>><<<5 EUR for wifi on low cost<br>Is not bad>>><<<Lmao, paying for electricity in a plane - what in the world>>><<<I want trust this airline because they might  want you to pay for the lifejackets before they activate.>>><<<In 1993, I did 13 hours on a Qantas 747-400 from Sydney to LAX and it was the most uncomfortable flight of my life ‚Äî and I&#39;ve flown in webbing troop seats on C-130s and in an F-4 and an A-7. (No padding or cushion on ejection seats.) It was like sitting on concrete and we were soon sitting on our jackets just to get a little padding. The call buttons didn&#39;t work, so we couldn&#39;t get any blankets to sit on, and for two full hours mid-flight (which was in daytime), we never saw any flight attendants even though our seats were close to a galley. For the final hour of the ordeal, there were nearly nonstop announcements about how Qantas had negotiated a quick passage through customs and immigration. We arrived at the same time as three other 747-400s, one each from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. It took <b>forever</b> to get through customs and immigration as they scrutinised each passenger&#39;s passports and visas.<br><br>After we got home, I wrote to the CEO of Qantas and told him all of the above. I got a <b>really</b> snarky reply from some underling or PR hack insisting that they had &quot;nothing to do with the customs and immigration procedures&quot; (despite all of the on-board bragging saying the opposite), that their seats were &quot;new and the best in the industry&quot;, and claiming that the number of cabin crew exceeded the legal minimum, making it &quot;impossible&quot; that none were seen for two minutes, let alone two hours. A few months later, one of the industry magazines had an article about how Qantas was replacing all of their seats with &quot;new, very comfortable&quot; models (despite the old ones being &quot;new and the best in the industry&quot;) and that the &quot;customer experience&quot; was being &quot;enhanced&quot;. I&#39;ve never been near another Qantas aircraft since and I&#39;ll <b>never</b> fly on one again. It wasn&#39;t just the way they equipped the aircraft (I love the 747) or the level of on-board &quot;service&quot;, it was the lies and refusal to admit any possibility a customer could have a valid complaint.<br><br>In contrast, the earlier flight we took from LA to Auckland was on an Air New Zealand 747-400 and it was one of the best flights I&#39;ve ever been on. Very comfortable, great and attentive service (even though it was an overnight flight), and a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. If I ever go to Australia again, I&#39;ll fly Air NZ to Auckland and get a connecting flight to Sydney, then return home the same way. <b>**</b> Qantas.>>><<<Will definitely fly scoot if the price is right.>>><<<Please note, we tried booking 2 meals and were told we cannot buy more than one meal>>><<<For me preferred mode of transport is business class.>>><<<Scoot livery is horrendous>>><<<I was told that we are not allowed to bring food on board. Can someone confirm for me if we can bring our own food. We are ordering one meal on board, but just want to know if we can bring our own food. Thanks for this wonderful video, we are going to do this and to be frank i am pretty scared. Can someone also tell me how was the seat? Hard, soft, comfortable?>>><<<Anyone from Australia - ‚Äú13 hours? Hold my beer.‚Äù üòÇ>>><<<I absolutely loathe buget carriers and will never fly them again.>>><<<2-3 hours max>>><<<4>>><<<most people can go 13 hours without eating no problem.<br><br>problem is if you‚Äôre missing those meal windows you‚Äôre gonna mess up your body clock if you‚Äôre flying across time zones and you‚Äôll feel the effects of jet lag even more>>><<<Well, considering that Scoot has the only direct flight between Berlin and Singapore I&#39;d risk a statement that people are using it as a necessity ;-)>>><<<I flew with Azur Air (Russian charter low cost airline) from Moscow to Varadero for 13 hours. Was terrible but considering extremely cheap price it was worth it>>><<<40 years ago we routinely flew 8 hours on airplanes without entertainment except for a few movies shown on central screens. People are spoiled today>>><<<I keep finding it counter-intuitive that budget airlines that crams the most seats on each plane uses the newest most advanced planes on the market while more expensive airlines, especially those with longer flights, uses second hand old planes they buys off budget airlines. The reason is budget airlines need to fly more flights each month, lower maintenance down times, carry more weight so need more powerful engines, and very importantly best fuel efficiency where fuel mileage per passenger counts to their profit margin and how competitively they can price their tickets. More expensive airlines carry fewer passengers and weight, less affected by fuel mileage so happy to save cost by using cheaper older planes they get second hand.>>><<<Just a warning. Scoot is notorious for delays. For many of their long distance flights, they do not fly every day. If lets say your flight from Athens to Singapore is cancelled, you may be rebooked on the next flight leaving several days later. All fine if you have a flexible travel schedule, but if you don&#39;t... you can end up getting a refund, but having to book last minute on another airline... which WILL be expensive. So you&#39;ll end up paying more out of pocket.>>><<<seats look like bus seats>>><<<‚ÄúBehind door 2, it¬¥s the rest of the economy class, where you can bring as many babies as you want.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ not in the middle of the flight‚Ä¶ right? üò•>>><<<I always take an empty plastic bottle to the airport and fill it up airside. <br>Many people just have to choose the lowest fare and this is fine. Norwegian fares Singapore to London Gatwick were often ¬£100 - 110 EUR>>><<<It‚Äôs great seeing economy class reviews. My wife and I just completed a twelve hour flight between Nadi, Fiji and Vancouver, Canada. These are the type of flights for which we need truthful reviews. Thanks!>>><<<Hell nah>>><<<One thing I hate when flying is to sit 13 hours with somebody&#39;s head on my lap. When this happens, I can&#39;t even open a laptop! So, I am already sold for SCOOT!>>><<<Sleep for 8 hours, that leaves 5 hours to watch a movie on your laptop. With earphones, 1 litre water bottle and sleeping pills, it sounds alright tbh. Especially for that price.>>><<<Depends the flight>>><<<Depends the price>>><<<Because the dude tortured himself for 13 hours I will subscribe>>><<<We have flown Scoot a few times and absolutely loved it! We paid A$96 one way business class Singapore to Sydney. If you can wait around a bit longer to book, they have specials on Tuesdays. I don&#39;t want to be spending bucket loads of mone on my transport to/from a destination so okay with the airline. It was comfortable, clean and best of all quiet - the cabin crew basically left you alone until you wanted something. I would fly with them again and again.>>><<<Seems kinda rough for that long of a flight!>>><<<One hour on a budget airline is crazy!>>><<<Water: take an empty 1 liter bottle with you, fill it up after the check-in at the airport.<br><br>Most airports have a place to fill up hot or cold water for free.>>><<<One simple answer: sleeping pills, I did singapore to athens and only remembered tbe landing and take off, I was window seat so no one bothered me>>><<<I love flying scoot. I usually bring a big empty bottle at least 1 litre and fill it up airside before boarding. Bring my own food, sandwiches or some bread rolls or even Mcdonalds from singapore airport (again airside). Have a power bank and many movies downloaded on my tablet with my noise cancelling earphones. With all of this for me it is just like a normal flight that costs twice as much. So get organised and put the saved $ to more spending money at your destination!>>><<<I used it between Singapore and Australia. It was possibly akin to being on a Roman slave galley.>>><<<its affordable. you get what you pay for.>>><<<The issues with water are further impacted flying sinapore to australia or au to singapore. No water can be taken onboard due to australian law and there is no free water.  Scoot promo plus fares (used to be called biz)  can be cheaper than base economy if carefully planned>>><<<What did you go to Singapore for>>><<<Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt fly with that airline at all, I have a huge distaste towards low cost airlines.>>><<<I generally do not fly lost cost carriers because they are too uncomfortable and unpleasant. Last year I flew from JFK to Singapore to Manila on Singapore Airlines which was excellent. But unfortunately on the return flights, Manila - Singapore was on Scoot. The check in at NAIA was the worst I have ever experienced. Really horrible and S L O W at some dinky little temporary counters that were a throw back to another era. The flight was also late in departing, and I wondered if I&#39;d make my connecting flight back to New York. It appears Scoot is Singapore Airlines low cost carrier or affiliate or whatever they are called. I never asked for, nor wanted to fly with them, and even though I booked Premium Economy there was no premium economy on this flight. They did serve me some non descript food and drinks which I guess they had to on  my overall premium economy ticket. I noticed not many other people were given anything at all. It was not my best travel experience and unless you enjoy being treated like an annoyance and abused, avoid them. You get what you pay for, and sometimes not!>>><<<none! economy and i don¬¥t mix well>>><<<This video is really good.   Well done for highlighting the issue with the water.>>><<<I   like  travelling  and  your review  are  absolutely  perfect and  helpful.  In the past few  times, I had my  eyes on this  flight  company, but the flight which I  was  looking to difrences was  too  small while I&#39;ve been compared.  I&#39;m  going  give  you  like  and subscription.  I  hope  you  don&#39;t  mind  if  I refer  to your  channel on my  reviews. <br>All  best>>><<<Ok‚Ä¶ I flew them and to be honest, they are not bad and the seat was more comfortable than I expected. I did manage to get some sleep on the flight. About the water, make sure you bring enough bottles to fill them up before boarding and may be fee snacks. I‚Äôd suggest pay a little extra to reserve Scoot Silence or a bit more extra for front row seats for more comfortable flights. I‚Äôd not mine flying Scoot again if the deal is great value!>>><<<That&#39;s not really cheap. In 2022 I flew from Singapore to Frankfurt and back with Singapore airline for 660 euros>>><<<In dem Moment als du meintest dass das P√§rchen noch weiter nach Melbourne fliegt üòÇ Im Hintergrund &quot;boah f*** alter&quot; das hat wohl perfekt gepasst beim schneiden üòÖ>>><<<My god...I&#39;d rather fly SQ in Business and get there alive. Just did so last week. Perfect.

RIP my trip to Melbourne.>>><<<just make sure they are doing maintenance>>><<<Well 15 years ago I would do it all the time. Now I would not do it for more than 4 hours.>>><<<I would have no upper limit. I‚Äôve flown LCCs many times and either order my meals or bring my own.<br><br>Mind you, it‚Äôs not only LCCs that lack free meals. Charter companies will merrily take you long haul with nothing unless you preorder or are happy with boring snacks.>>><<<The trick is to catch the plane just before bedtime. Just sleep your way to Asia.>>><<<As a Malaysian, Scoot‚Äôs nasi lemak should be disowned>>><<<It&#39;s not recommended to travel long haul with budget airlines if you want a little bit comfort or not bored to death sitting beside a not so normal size human sitting beside you, travelled with AirAsia to Auckland, NZ with two layovers in KL and Gold Coast with no entertainment, eye mask, ear muffles or pillow and yes inflight extras as expensive... lol!>>><<<Damn. I&#39;ve just spent 5 hours flying on a single isle plane with a low cost carrier and found that to be exhausting...>>><<<Dude I flew to NZ and back for only 400 more, with entertainment and food included. But cheers for doing this!>>><<<Can Scoot mileage be linked to KrisWorld?>>><<<What on earth is ‚Äúeconomy class‚Äù?>>><<<It looked like the plane was only a quarter full, which makes you wonder how the airline can operate such routes economically.>>><<<Definitely not for me !!>>><<<Did Melbourne to London on Air Asia. Was really good.>>><<<max. 5 hours>>><<<What is this accent>>><<<Maximum on a low cost for me is 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds.>>><<<Avoid Scoot or any Singapore or Malaysian budget airline.>>><<<For me, scoot is a hit or miss, and i agreed te food wasn&#39;t the best. If i fkew long haul with low cost carrier, my first choice will always be Air Asia, on their premium flatbed,  vor routes between Malaysia to Australia. The food is surprisingly decent. However,  scoot is still better than another LC carrier Cebu Pacific. That one is reslly brutal and only for the strong amd extremely budget minded person. They fly between the Philippines to Australia and the middle east.>>><<<Not today or ever.>>><<<I literally flew Scoot economy class from Singapore to Berlin and back in Dec 2021. 5 months later, I flew on a full service airline from Singapore to London and back. And I realised why people paid for full service.>>><<<Better not hear any complaining you choose to fly low cost for 12 hours>>><<<Just flew Scoot. As someone from the US who refuses to fly Spirit but loves Southwest I was hopeful that Scoot would be more like Southwest (which while budget seems to prioritize passenger‚Äôs comfort) vs. Spirit (which nickels and dimes you for everything).<br>Unfortunately definitely came off more like Spirit with extra for Wi-Fi (and all packages limited data amounts), extra for charging, no streaming entertainment, no adjustable headrests, and worst no complimentary beverages including water when we weren‚Äôt allowed to bring our own onboard due to the way the Singapore gate was setup.>>><<<Not bad just pop a Valium and sleep the whole way>>><<<This just highlights how much other airlines overcharge you.  Compared to the cost of the plane, maintenance, fuel, staff, etc., removing inflight entertainment, meals, etc. is not a huge saving, yet there is a huge difference in ticket price.>>><<<Choice is good. Buy water at the airport if you want to save more. I have the luxury to be able to fly comfortably - in my younger days I would have been happy for the savings.>>><<<I did SYD-SIN last summer on the same plane and it was one of the worst flights ever. Staff was rude, they didn&#39;t turn off the light for a long time despite being a night flight. The passengers were the worst: loud, rude and disturbing. But, I must say, the price was unbeatable.>>><<<This airline is the worst airline.....especially long haul ...>>><<<I flew from Phuket Thailand to melbourne. staff were helpful and polite (much beter than a lot of national carriers) Price was very reasonable. I would fly with them again.>>><<<I honestly can spend up to only an hour or two without any of those.>>><<<Just FYI, electricity on a plane is not free.  In the 787 there are separate generators that consume jet fuel to make electricity.  A regular plane has a generator section connected to the engines that takes more fuel to make electricity.  Also the electronics to convert that energy into usable passenger adds weight making the plane less fuel efficient.  That said, still a rip off.  OMG never ever heard of an airline that charges for electricity.  Heck even Southwest doesn&#39;t do that.  oh wait, they don&#39;t have it at all..  lol.  good video ;-)>>><<<Nothing about the most important - The seat comfort, width and its reclineability ?>>><<<&#39;Mystery snack pack&#39; ü§£>>><<<Always bring an empty bottle to fill up on the toilet!>>><<<It says on Scoot‚Äòs website: ‚ÄûConsumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board.‚Äú Is it not enforced then?>>><<<Honestly, you could just like take a xanax and you will be fine in the end>>><<<I did scoot gold coast to Hanoi via Singapore and it was OK... I&#39;d give them a chance to get me to Europe at least>>><<<Charging a lot for bottled water is standard on any airline where you pay for drinks. None of the extra costs mentioned would bother me if I was paying half the cost of a regular service especially as we almost all have smart devices with downloaded films. For me it‚Äôs all about seat pitch and from what I could see that looked ok>>><<<No scoot for me!>>><<<Super cheap but the food is almost un edible. So bring your own.>>><<<I flew Berlin to Singapore on Scoot in 2018. Very basic and it was delayed 24 hours. The onward flight to Melbourne ended up being on Singapore Airlines because of the delay. Essentially it is about expectations - keep your expectations low and relax - no problems!>>><<<I recently did Sydney/Manila on Cebu/pacific - its is basic - after a four and a half hour wait to check in the plane was even more late leaving. My son said this plane is only built for 330 pax but modified to take 410. I think they had removed some toilets to get more seats in. Only 3 toilets up front were working and had a continious line up and They were filthy (pee on floor etc). the 8 hour flight was absolute torcher.   I realise it was a budget flight but this lack of basic hygene is wrong.     I paid extra for front row seating but as they changed the aircraft just before we flew they just put us anywhere - I&#39;ve neveer been able to get a refund of the difference. I could go on a lot more but its useless and I will NEVER fly Cebupacific again.>>><<<nope, only star alliance member airlines>>><<<0 minutes.>>><<<How much is it to use the bathroom, and is there number 2 surcharge?>>><<<The problem is, the money you save is so small in many cases!>>><<<I am from Singapore and i LOVE this airline - this is my personal advice to everyone - Please just upgrade your seats to reclining sleeping seats (this should be the premier package that comes with a screen and charging port for you.) I do this for all flights exceeding 6 hours. Best of all some flights have screens and charging ports for you on the economy class - but i still always recommend everyone to just upgrade your seat to the reclining ones.>>><<<I feel that budget airlines are the new economy. Pretty amazing deal for long flights. If anything it should give the non budget airlines pause when they compete in terms of amenities. Honestly if you‚Äôre not into mileage points this is a solid option>>><<<Great content , lots of things can be planned for tone fair , bring a tablet , <br>Iots of water and food , most airports offer free filling so bring an empty bottle and your golden.>>><<<allowed to use the phone?>>><<<I&#39;m pretty sure the crew will give you free water from the aircraft&#39;s potable water tank supply. They certainly should.>>><<<Actually the flight was great, just the passengers are young people and travellers, so the atmosphere is different compared to a more expensive airline.  Downloaded books and videos for entertainment. Just serve a proper coffee, it is horrible. Next time I smuggle a Starbucks on board. But the price was magnificant.>>><<<This dude buys a Scoot flight and complains about a fair 2‚Ç¨ for a water. What a clown ü§° would never take this flight with the obnoxious Berlin type people on board>>><<<That price for water is horrible>>><<<not even entertainment bruh>>><<<If you have to fly SCOOT stay home and save for a proper vacation! Even in young people the risk of DVTs is unacceptable, especially if you&#39;re dehydrated.>>><<<No one will want to travel in low cost budget if possible but the thing is most people dont have any choice like you do>>><<<I&#39;ve only done BNE to SE Asia on low cost carriers (JetBlah, AirAsia X). Being about 5-6 hours, they were OK... but to Europe, YIKES! I dunno either.>>><<<No way could I fly on this airline on their anything class throughout the plane. I&#39;ve known people who&#39;ve done it and say never again.>>><<<Scoot appears to be absolutely crap‚Ä¶ several much better LCCs around.>>><<<That works out to neRly ‚Ç¨700 return, that is not cheap, especially with the add ons , it&#39;s possible to fly return to Singapore with a recognised carrier for about the same price if you&#39;re flexible with your booking and not mind a stopover .>>><<<I never been longer thsn 9 hours, to be honest more than 6 is too much in a low cost>>><<<If I really had to go places and paying anything extra for a proper flight would harm my financial stability or prohibit me from doing other stuff I want to do at my destination I would consider it, but other than that, that&#39;s just no form of flying. I don&#39;t quite unterstand why low cost carriers are always so keen on showing the world that they&#39;re shitty. Eurowings is low-cost, too, but they at least have a primitive IFE. On a plane setting you back 200 Million Dollars, there&#39;s no reason to save the 50k they&#39;d have to pay for IFE. Make people pay a few bucks to use it or even 3 SGD per film if you want, but at least offer it. This cabin looks like from 40 years ago. There is nothing wrong with cutting costs as an airline in order to offer cheap tickets, but why not make an effort to make things as comfortable as possible without spending lots of money?<br><br>Cramp them seats in there, make me pay for food and IFE, make me pay for the electricity if you feel the need, but at least offer smth and dim the lights. Color these seats in a way I sent get eye cancer.>>><<<I would 100% fly with them! Just make sure to charge an iPad with movies before boarding, and bring my own water and food for the trip.>>><<<Would have been good if you told us the price of a comparable flight with a better carrier as I dont fly there. Otherwise amazing vid.>>><<<That looks . . . rough. :(>>><<<Great video!! I live on the east coast of Australia (Brisbane) and the nearest International airport is 15 mins from my house, so it&#39;s fairly convenient to fly a full service International airline to Asia/Americas/Middle East and beyond. Conversely, we have access to budget airlines mainly flying from the Gold Coast (1.5-2hrs by car). I&#39;ve often costed out a trip on a full service airline from  Brisbane vs a budget airline from  the Gold Coast and after the added expense on transport to the airport, luggage, meals etc the full service airline generally wins from a economic (and comfort) perspective. Takeaway points - research all prices and add ons the budget price may not be so budget after all>>><<<5 hours Else I will be bored>>><<<Honestly, I think this video would attract many more casual viewers if it was called something more catchy like: &quot;The longest low-cost flight in the world! (then the rest of the video title)&quot;.<br>Great video otherwise!>>><<<It cannot be worse than 13 hrs on British Airways economy . On one flight the flight attendant actually apologised for the cardboard breakfast they served not long before landing .>>><<<Worst looking cabin food ever, unless im dying from hunger. Their flghts notoriously famous for delays too. Again, unless its a mega sale fare or only airline to fly that desti.>>><<<The Scoot website states that &quot;Consumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board&quot;, so it may not be possible to bring your own. People have reported that they had actually taken their drinks away from them before boarding and that they couldn&#39;t get anything to drink on board without paying even when they said they were feeling unwell. I would never fly with an airline that treats their customers in such a way.>>><<<the silence section needs to happen in more airlines, especially the non-budget ones>>><<<Short Trips yes but on Long Haul Flights no.>>><<<I flew Scoot on SIN-SYD few years ago. They blasted the air con to the max in order to get people to pay for the blankets (and the unprepared ones were in t-shirts and shorts having boarded from Singapore). They also made constant announcements that passengers were not allowed to consume food brought onto the plane themselves, and I had to swallow my food like committing a major crime. So yeah you get what you paid for.>>><<<Scoot tends to change your flight itenaries alot>>><<<Great review. I love it when vloggers actually fly like the rest of us -- in economy.>>><<<No thanks I would rather book on a good airline>>><<<I may be poor but that&#39;s something I won&#39;t compromise...

Even if you don&#39;t care about any amenities, this would be worth it just for the checked bag alone.<br>That&#39;s why to me it always seems like flying Scoot would only ever be worth it if you are flying one-way or if you need the absolute fastest connection between Berlin/Athens to Singapore.>>><<<Today i learned alot.

I would be surprised if it wasn&#39;t given that it was Asian style food prepared in an Asian country.>>><<<Someone needs to explain the economics of this to me‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt the biggest expenses the plane itself and the fuel?  Not the food and movies‚Ä¶ so how does that work on long haul, then?  Especially when there aren‚Äôt more premium seats to charge for, and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre fitting double the amount of economy seats in there either‚Ä¶?>>><<<4hrs max>>><<<To be honest I think I can‚Äôt survive a long haul flight with scoot but I can survive a short haul flight since it has no tv>>><<<Flown scoot a few times, honestly the food was okay i thought. also had both the nasi lemak and mums fried rice. will need to give air asia a go to see how it compares.>>><<<Basically ,Scoot is the exact opposite from Singapore Airlines .>>><<<I avoid airlines that offer low fares, then remove amenities like power ports for the sake of recovering revenue. Also, no in-flight entertainment? Come ON! Also noted, and agree. Other low-cost carrier Air Asia has surprisingly decent food options in their Santan line. &quot;Uncle Chin&#39;s Chicken Rice&quot; is a personal favorite.>>><<<No I couldn‚Äôt do this.>>><<<Wow,those two meals looked absolutely brutally bad. Jesus>>><<<Hell, if there&#39;s an asian girl waiting for me in Singapore, I&#39;d fly a damn kite there if I&#39;d have to.>>><<<No I would not.>>><<<if the price is the cheapest by a wide margin, and it&#39;s a direct flight. i have no complaints. doesn&#39;t matter how expensive their water is, it ain&#39;t an issue.>>><<<I flew ScootPlus from Sydney to Singapore, ScootPlus provides seats that are equivalent to premium economy on other airlines, it also included entertainment, food and beverages. While Scoot may not allow babies and toddlers in the Scoot-in-Silence cabin they do allow them in ScootPlus and so we had crying, screaming, misbehaving toddlers all the way to Singapore. Overall it was an ok experience but I wouldn&#39;t fly with them again, better just to pay extra and fly economy class with a full-service airline.>>><<<Only down side is flying Boeing.>>><<<When I travel I need to travel in style. SQ Business class and above that&#39;s it.

Gross.>>><<<Best seats on this flight are in the crew rest area ü§£ ....... Having flown AirAsiaX on the A330 a few years back, I found it to be pretty decent.<br>About 20 rows of seats for passengers over 12 years only ........ bliss üòÜ>>><<<IT IS SO BAD!>>><<<When you look at Scoot‚Äôs destination map, in Europe and the middle east they basically serve destinations that are too small for it to be profitable to serve with Singapore Airlines.>>><<<David, I still miss your Expectations -Met/Not Met!>>><<<To be honest, a 3-hours-flight is the pretty much for me in a LCC airline.>>><<<I think 2 euro for water is still cheaper than in many airports.Its really Good option for people travelling without add ons,No food No luggage just Good price.if You add everything the price Will be similar to full service carrier>>><<<Out of interest, having viewed your vlog, I checked Scoot&#39;s price from Berlin to Manila for my upcoming trip at the end of the year. I can fly more cheaply from Edinburgh to Manila with both Qatar and Emirates, and without the additional cost of connecting to Berlin, so this is a no go for me (thank goodness!).>>><<<I wouldn&#39;t spend more than a few hours on a low cost airline, low cost airlines are fine for short haul flights, if I&#39;m going to take a flight to the other side of the world then i want my journey to be as comfortable as possible including having food and a few beers and inflight entertainment where i can pass the time on a couple of movies, I&#39;ve read the reviews for scoot on skytrax &amp; TripAdvisor and the majority of them are negative, it&#39;s enough to put me off from flying with scoot>>><<<Book Singapore Airlines instead, they own Scoot !>>><<<I paid 750‚Ç¨ for a return trip in October of 22 with Quatar. So not even that much more but way more comfortable. If the flight was like 200‚Ç¨, I&#39;d consider it>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=432">7:12</a> Their website officially say consumption of outside food and beverage is not allowed lol>>><<<I‚Äôm flying to Sydney soon and scoot was by far the cheapest option, so yes, i don‚Äôt mind. <br>Last Autumn I took an overnight bus trip from Munich to Paris and two days later another overnight bus trip from Paris to London and I didn‚Äôt mind.

I didnt buy the ticket so i had no choice but i will NEVER fly low cost carriers ever again.>>><<<I wouldn‚Äôt.>>><<<if you have a family with small children, please don&#39;t use a budget airline...I learned the hard and painful way when I took a budget airline to Hongkong from Singapore. I end up paying more for the additional purchases than if I took full-service airlines for services that are already free. if I&#39;m alone, then yes budget airline is the way as i will be sleeping all the way through the flight.>>><<<The problem with low coast airlines is reliability. What‚Äôs their policy on if the flights delayed and you miss your connecting flight? My experience with low cost carriers is that they are risky, they can just cancel the flight and not give you your money back.>>><<<Friend with Scoots to Singapore from Sydney Australia. He said even on Scoots business the meals quality are less than normal Singapore airline economy>>><<<I would only travel on this type of plane for max. 2 hours>>><<<I assume not many people are willing to take these flights...so empty rows for your self?>>><<<I made my 8hr flight from Sing to Mel super comfortable by paying a little for an exit row, and then I brought my own food, water and phone with predownloaded entertainment, it was honestly super nice>>><<<Checked SYD to ATH for fun. Without food or entertainment for such a long flight, one-way it‚Äôs almost AUD $1,000. That is too expensive for what it is then there are the add ons.<br><br>Does Scoot offer movies using screens they provide you? Sure I‚Äôd pay. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like.>>><<<The longest i could take budget airlines for is max 2-3 hours. Respect that you managed to survive for 13 hours>>><<<I flew scoot from Tokyo to Sydney via Singapore in cattle class and airline, service and even seat were ok.  What was not ok was the passengers.  Hence I‚Äôll avoid it in the future.>>><<<For the price,  I love flying with Scoot and the food isn&#39;t that bad. Scoot offers the most value for money and new planes too (747-8).>>><<<At this price is unbelievable!<br>Consider that a 9hs flight from Buenos Aires to EEUU can cost three times and the legroom be even worse.>>><<<I salute you, brother. ü´°>>><<<I barely survived a 13 hour flight in Premium economy on United. I cant even imagine having to do this>>><<<the most valuable information for me in this video is the passenger could and should bring their own water into the cabin for the long haul flight. <br>Thank you very much David!>>><<<It‚Äôs better to check on different full service airlines tbh. I paid 550‚Ç¨ for a return flight to Singapore from Frankfurt with saudia.>>><<<320 Euros ONE WAY? 640 Euros return.... I can find flights with decent airlines for that price anytime>>><<<its actually not bad (as compared to Airasia), but of course, its more expensive than Airasia too>>><<<the secret to surviving long flight on scoot is to pick book a timing you&#39;ll sleep super well in. I fell asleep when the plane took off and when I woke up, the plane was landing. Best flight experience for a budget airline.<br><br>Scoot business has also better seats than economy class of major airlines for similar price points. The only downside is the lack of entertainment.>>><<<Scheint ausgelastet zu sein....>>><<<Are you allowed to bring your own food on Scoot? I remember you can only consume what they sell.>>><<<Weird, eurowings is also a budget airline but has power ports, entertainment systems and free food for main meals>>><<<Stupid airline charges for power>>><<<Agree about the food; Air Asia has much better food and agree that charging to use the onboard power points is a money grab as the AC power generated comes from the aircraft&#39;s own engines.>>><<<Took that flight years ago at beginning of march 2020 from Singapore back home to BerlinüòÖ. <br>Wonderful flight half the plain for myself for obvious reasons ü¶†. Get prepared with films on your phone, own blanked and neck pillow. <br>It was way Better than my overcrowded and expensive Lufthansa flight to Singapore 5 month before. But next time I would not count  on an global pandemic to clear half the plane again üòÖ>>><<<nice to have found your vlog, Glad you said you get what you paid for, I Fly scoot from aust to singapore and then other asian routes, for me the longest flight is 5 1/2 hrs. So this is comfortable with out meals,movie, power . Well done doing 13 hrs  for me any long haul is with Sing air.  FYI there is free water in the toilet cabin>>><<<The money saved I can upgrade to a 5 star hotel for a week. I take that>>><<<If I was stuck in Berlin and this flight fits my schedule I will take it. Having to pay for entertainment means going back to the old days of reading a book or interacting with fellow travelers,or just sleeping. A shame about the bottled water cost but save your money for better food in SG.>>><<<A very interesting video for me. I have personally flown economy on Scoot 787s a number of times between Sydney and Singapore. It‚Äôs pretty much like any other reputable airline so I would happily fly that route again given the low price. I might even fly on to Europe from Singapore but only after a stopover.<br>In my opinion, it is inappropriate to compare the cost of a meal on a low budget carrier like Scoot and what you might pay for a similar meal in an everyday situation. It is very expensive to provide hot meals etc on planes and not doing so is how the low cost carrier can offer low fares. The more appropriate question is: what is the total package costing compared to a full service flight? Even with the egregious price for water etc, the total price for this trip is amazingly low. It‚Äôs not quite as amazing as the headline price but it‚Äôs still amazing.<br>I would also eat before getting on the plane and either fast, preorder a light meal or bring some food with me given it‚Äôs such a long flight. You can take a book, a tablet, headphones and an external battery. This will make it as good as any other economy flight. If it‚Äôs not good enough, one needs to go business class.>>><<<No, I won&#39;t fly with them. Long haul low cost? I&#39;d rather not go. I would wait and save up for at least premium economy. Those seats look awfully uncomfortable. 13 hours?! It will cost more on massages. The thought of the return journey will spoil the holiday. The meals didn&#39;t look like real food. <br>The longest low cost flight (Easyjet) I have ever done was just under 2 hours. That was about 20 years ago. Don&#39;t do low cost flights any more.>>><<<worst food!!! they changed my flight schedule without proper notification and the ticket priced also not cheap they also charged me for extra 5 kilos of luggage that i didn&#39;t even brought with me ( Athens - Singapore -Manila and returned 2022)üò°üò°üò°üò°>>><<<787 just simply the worst long-haul out of 777 and 350 period. no 787 should go 9 abreast and 777,350 should go 10 abreast either, its just toooo much.>>><<<The longest I&#39;m willing to do on a low cost airline is 4 maybe 5 tops. I am not willing to do anything more than 8 hours in economy class on any airline though>>><<<Charging for the outlet is just too far. Next they be charging to use the lavatory. I‚Äôd just shit on my tray table and close it.>>><<<i flew for 13.5hrs from sin-ber after syd-sin (~8hrs). I wasnt feeling the half of my body after all. although it was a350, the seats are the same and literally they are even worse than bus seat. besides of seating on a chair (i dont wanna call it seat) during the longhaaul flight, the lady next to me sat on the floor, put her head on the part that she is supposed to sit on and constantly hit me and invaded my space in her sleep in the last couple of hours. the worst flight exp ever! i also paid extra for seat selection in my second flight but i was given another seat in the middle. i checked if it was the same on the app and on my boarding pass. they were same but after the checkin my selection was updated on the app too so i didnt notice that mistake n update till got the middle seat rather than a window one. meals were terrible too. everything was terrible about it and it wasnt that much cheap though. air fares are very scary in the postcovid era. everybody should think twice before choosing a lowbudget airline for a longhaul fligth cuz you may regret.>>><<<Thanks for the video but for a long travel time like that, I&#39;d rather pay for business class and I&#39;m not rich btw..>>><<<I flew Zipair from SIN-NRT-LAX last year coz I missed my ANA. Love it when the price is right. Regular price is around 300USD one way. I booked the flight departing in 2 hours and it only cost me 800 I am blessed (UA/ANA wanted 4000, in economy, one way)<br>Later I flew Zip often, mostly in their biz class called Zipflat. The only complain I have for those long haul ULCCs is the water! You need to buy water even in &quot;biz&quot; class. I drink a lot, around 4L in the plane. 2 meals give me 600mL and my water bottle gives me another 500mL. I also bought a 1L water in the airport but that was still not enough but I made it.<br><br>I am going to fly real business class few days later from DPS to SIN to JFK in SG&#39;s signature super long haul route, 18.5 hours non stop. Let me see if my body can handle it. It is a challenge for both the flight and myself.>>><<<Brutally honest..NO!  I would not fly a LCC like that. Better stay at home.>>><<<I flew with scoot once in Nov 2018 jakarta-singapore and should return to base after 15 mins take off due to cabin pressure failure>>><<<For a long haul flight like this I rather pay more to feel comfortable. Not offering at least simple drinking water is cruel in my eyes.Don¬¥t need any entertainment though. Just a comfy seat, somehow good food and water would do the trick for me.>>><<<They really push the law of supply and demand lol. They don&#39;t let you bring your own water unless it&#39;s bought from the airport, which is just as overpriced>>><<<I once regularly (weekly) flew Scoot from Changi to Xi&#39;an, China...about 6 hours each way.  That was tolerable.>>><<<3 hrs>>><<<anything above 3 hours in economy is terrifying>>><<<Id rather put in the work and take a premium airline>>><<<I guess Singapore Airlines serves the same food in the Economy, incl. in ticket price.>>><<<Despite the not very favourable review thank you for giving the real picture of your experience and of course, thank you for supporting Singapore carriers!>>><<<I&#39;d  definitely fly 46 hrs by budget airline... what&#39;s the problem... easy>>><<<Electricity on the plane is not free. It puts load on the electrical systems which in turn puts load on the generator which by virtual of being connected to the engines puts load on, to which consumes fuel.<br><br>So no, it is not free. If it is provided free it will be charged in the ticket, there will be the add issue of calculating fuel to load as it cost fuel to carry more fuel. So ya it&#39;s not that simple.>>><<<Mine is 5-7 hours>>><<<So meals ARE available, just for purchase<br>Works for me!>>><<<Get a massage and a good meal when you land with some of the money you saved.>>><<<I flew scoot fro SG to SYD - I thought they were pretty good.>>><<<People who say they‚Äôd be ok with this have clearly never flown long haul before.>>><<<17 hours from Singapore to New York on this airline will be brutal. 3 hours is okay if flying regional>>><<<Too expensive! 1.685‚Ç¨ Berlin - Melbourne.>>><<<Honestly ‚Äî Stay far away from low-cost airline.>>><<<We managed to fly on this line from Berlin to Singapore at 2018 on inaugural flight. We paid 400‚Ç¨ for two return tickets in total. An got cupcake, pair of socks and dance from a cabin crew. It was reasonable but I have to agree that the most annoying thing was the water price. For a normal price I wouldn‚Äôt book the flight again. Thanks for a video. It brings back the memories.>>><<<Bro ate the mask leak without the sambal (the sauce) on the rice>>><<<Scoot sucks>>><<<I always take the legroom reviews with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm 193cm tall myself. British Airways short haul economy has a pitch of 30 inches. Even if I sit all the way to the back of the seat, my legs will still hit the seat in front of me. I think the Scoot 787 comes with 31 inches if pitch. I highly doubt that I‚Äôll be able to do this for 12 hour on board that 787.>>><<<Scoot does exactly what it says on the box, you get a seat on a well maintained plane that will deliver you from A to B. No surprises there.<br>However, if you have a problem the email and phone systems for dealing with that problem seem to be grossly overloaded and/or under-manned.¬†<br>Scoot&#39;s stated response time to an email complaint is currently up to 10 working days.<br>Trying to contact Scoot via phone(in Australia at least) is an exercise in frustration.>>><<<i won&#39;t anymore>>><<<I can knit or read.  I don&#39;t do much that needs to plug in, anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter.  As long as the trip takes.>>><<<Malaysia food is always better than Singapore :)>>><<<Wait, not even water is included?<br><br>I would do it if I really need a cheap flight but in most situations I really wouldn‚Äôt>>><<<Scoot sucks! Even 4 hours, Singapore to Manila and back recently. Connecting flights booked unwittingly by Singapore Air from South Africa (not cheap either).  Both flights were late, staff were inexperienced  adolescents, treated like sheep, uncomfortable. Food was rubbish.  Horrible experience as part of a long haul. Singapore has hand in this, damaging their brand for sure.>>><<<Just a shame on the price rise to even have a holiday, i was considering a holiday, family of 4 and the prices have risen so much. Just before the pandemic 2ish years ago, spent 2 weeks in Dubai, hotel with half board cost me ¬£4700 pounds, looked up yesterday and with the same airline, dates and hotel is now ¬£8400. Seems to be the same where ever you look.>>><<<I have a bad back so long haul LCC isn‚Äôt for me. The longest LCC flight I‚Äôve been on is only an hour from Manila to Cebu in the Philippines. I do fly WestJet frequently on Canada to US flights but they feel like a step above an LCC carrier, (but not quite a legacy carrier) so that probably doesn‚Äôt count.>>><<<It&#39;s interesting to note that LEVEL is actually quite a pleasant way to fly.>>><<<Just went on a flight from SIN to OOL (Gold Coast Australia) but now they are suspending the route. So sad :(>>><<<Can you take your own water bottles? Are they strict about the no outside food? Are they more lenient if foods for kids?>>><<<The question at the start - for me, it depends on how much anaesthetic I&#39;d be allowed before boarding>>><<<If you pay 350 one way, that is not cheap definitely>>><<<With LCCs, it always seem a lot less worth it the moment you have to add checked baggage. It&#39;s not too far off full carrier which at least provides you with meals during a long haul.>>><<<Does anyone know what happened to the Low Cost Tickets?? When I checked just recently the prices from BER to SIN its around 900‚Ç¨ and higher than &quot;normal&quot; the airlines like Etihad or Qatar. Why should anyone use Scoot any longer, with no service and same price other Airlines with meals and entertainment>>><<<Flew on Scoot from Singapore to Cebu as a Singapore Air transfer. It was business class and figured in total price.  Under 3 hours.  From LAX to Singapore on Singapore Air then Scoot to Cebu.  Singapore Air is great.  Living in Washington State now Eva Air Seattle to Taiwan to Cebu. Being 182 cm tall and and 98 kg I use business as more comfortable. Don&#39;t think I could make it 13 hours on basic economy.  It is the tight seating.>>><<<really liked your attitude.  hateful are vloggers who complain about low cost airlines when they are just getting their money&#39;s worth.  self-entitled cheapskates!!!>>><<<Please make a review of US-Bangla Airlines, Novoair and Air Astra of Bangladesh. Bangladesh aviation industry is growing recently. You&#39;ve already reviewed the national flag bearer Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Please review the three private airlines next and give your opinion about their service and quality.>>><<<Anyone flown Europe to Aus? I‚Äôve flown Scoot Biz now Scoot Plus between Singapore &amp; Australia a few times. Hubby is an aviation enthusiast (airline snob) who actually loves the flying aspect but he‚Äôs also a tall and big guy so he will only fly premium economy or business. He did he doesn‚Äôt think he can fly that long without flat bed and he just hated flying economy to Europe with Emirates even in exit rows. Which is ironic since he can sleep anytime literally standing up to board a plane or on a construction site and in the one who has trouble sleeping on planes.  <br><br>If anyone has done Europe to Aus what was it like? I suggested we break up the flight by staying in Singapore 2 or 3 nights which is what I usually like to do since I don‚Äôt sleep on planes. Stay a couple of nights in Asia or Dubai so I can have real sleep and start adjusting to time difference. I would love to know if Scoot Plus holds up against other premium economy seats. Thanks üôè>>><<<i tried 7 hours on Scoot from Tokyo to Singapore on &quot;Business Class&quot; thinking there will be entertainment! There was 1 microwaved meal, 1 bottled 300ml water and bigger seat - not even wine if you want to purchase!! I ended up staring into blank and forcing myself to sleep, starving... &gt;-&lt; Will do it again but with my own entertainment alot of food and a bottle of wine!>>><<<I wont fly even if they pay me. Humans are not animals>>><<<Great video üì∏>>><<<Nothing seems bad. First of all, it&#39;s a non-stop flight, and secondly, you don&#39;t starve for 12 hours even though you received two meals.<br>At this price, it&#39;s super OK.<br>Try to go with TAROM from Bucharest to Beirut and you will see that you pay almost 200 Euros and get a candy and a glass of water.

Never do low-cost long haul flight again.>>><<<Hey simply aviation, nice videos :D>>><<<Well, when my sister and me travelled to Singapore in 1993, we did so without in-flight entertainment, too, because it wasn&#39;t yet a thing.

I do pay extra for scoot in silence, pre order meals and pack a power bank into my carry on.  The food isn&#39;t great but where else can you get the extra leg room and a guarantee of no screaming babies for a similar price?  I tried Scoot Plus and yes it&#39;s more comfortable but at 8 hours not necessary (probably not even at 12 hours),and it&#39;s a significant cost over &#39;scoot in silence&#39; where as &#39;scoot in silence&#39; isn&#39;t a great deal more expensive than economy.<br><br>My recommendation... definitely &#39;Scoot in Silence&#39;.>>><<<When aax turn around this scoot will go restructuring again>>><<<that is a nightmare no nothing no food no water no movies <br>u will go crazy>>><<<tape to the ceiling i dont care.>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot several times between Taipei and Singapore(and will be doing so again in two weeks). For short haul flights it&#39;s not that bad. Would not do so on flights longer than that. But I guess for the ultra-low-budget travellers it&#39;s a good compromise.>>><<<Do they still have the rule where you can‚Äôt bring your own food and drinks on the plane? They use to fly HNL&gt;KIX&gt;SG but they closed out after just 1 year. Not much HI locals liked the idea of not allowing food onboard unless you bought from them. Since HI is famous about plate lunches and bentos.>>><<<The lack of adjustable headrests on these Scoot 787 aircraft would be the main downfall for me - same on Air Asia A330. One of the worst flights in my life was on an Air Asia A330, impossible to sleep. Surprisingly T&#39;way Air from Korea however,  surprisingly comfortable, in seat power, holder for iPad in seat tray, adjustable headrest etc made them far more comfortable for longer journey...>>><<<Less than 2 hours Mate on a low cost airline>>><<<You got a very good price but usually it&#39;s more like Euro 450 for the sector Berlin to Singapore. Singapore to Berlin is even higher.<br><br>The final price for a return ticket is raw SGD 1330 at this moment, for a return flight in June. No Changi prison style meals, no platinum water included.

I mean I‚Äôm okay with having no food, movies and blankets, but that feeling, like being looked upon as peasants, having to pay for anything you touch is unsettling.

London to KUL normally took about 13 hours 30 minutes, and KUL to London was a bit longer, taking about 14 hours 5 minutes. Coincidentally, I also used to live in Berlin. Until the opening of Brandenburg Airport, Berlin really did not fly to any long-haul destinations simply because of the limitations of Tegel. When services moved to Sch√∂nefeld, which would become part of Berlin Brandenburg Airport, things got better. However, the fact that Brandenburg Airport was able to open at all was a small miracle after running into a never-ending list of logistical and financial problems throughout the more than 14 years after construction began to finally open for commercial traffic.>>><<<Height in centimeters????<br>What&#39;s a centimeter??>>><<<Power bank + smartphone ready with plenty of movies/series/books + water (after security check) and food (before security check as it&#39;s cheaper) bought at the airport is the playbook to fly low cost for more than say, 3 hours.>>><<<This is a brave man. He does these things so we do not need to.>>><<<To be fair, most of us Aussies don‚Äôt consider a 7hr flight to Singapore as a long haul flight.>>><<<Scoot is a good low cost airline to fly on, but their inflight food is terrible compared to rivals like Air Asia X.>>><<<longest ULCC flight i‚Äôve done was 5 hours long on frontier. never again üíÄüíÄüíÄ>>><<<When are you uploading videos<br>   BUT GOOD JOB <br>Can you fly Peach Aviation from KIX Kansai Airport<br>Thanks>>><<<I like how it&#39;s spelled &quot;Mum&#39;s&quot;>>><<<Thank you for your vid√©o and informations.

Only the &quot;SCOOT&quot; flights prices for two persons were good 1000 ‚Ç¨ - cheap. In the early morning of the travel day I became a travel flight information via SMS about a massive delay departure from Singapore to Berlin. The aircraft needs many hours more and I had a lot of time before I must go to the airport Berlin-Tegel (closed now). My mother was the second person. Her travel was impossible to make. After a short talk about the new situation I contacted the &quot;SCOOT&quot; hotline and told they there about the massive delay flight for a complete cancelation! Today I know it was a mistake to cancel the flights. The passenger rights say You have the chance to refund the price and flight for free (12 hours later departure after regular time and 10000 kilometers flight range).>>><<<So basically the same as Economy on most major airlines? I don&#39;t see a lot more on offer here except perhaps for in-flight entertainment which a lot of people don&#39;t need anyway as they bring their own devices.

I find it hard to imagine why they wouldn&#39;t.>>><<<OMG you missed the most outrageous thing on that Scoot flight. üòí People are actually prohibited to bring own meal and water on board.

But (and at least before covid), they used to have a number of tablets with movies &amp; episodes to rent for a fee. It was on TXL - SIN about 4y ago. Dunno if they still offer it nowdays. I just had my phone full with Netflix downloads. But there were at least 5passengers who prefered to rent them.>>><<<So your main complain is a 333 ml water bottle at 3‚Ç¨ ü•∏>>><<<AirAsia&#39;s meals are tasted and selected by the owner. The menu has been like that since 15 years ago. I love traveling with them.<br>But Scoot (Tiger Airways) and its affiliates? Meh... not the worst, but also not the best. At least it is better than Cebu Pacific. The plane being 787 also immensely helps. The low cost A330 is extremely awful, and they squeeze you with 28&quot; pitch.<br>In general, avoid taking long haul flights from and to notorious begpacking countries. Going from Berlin to world&#39;s most expensive city like Singapore on budget airline is like walking to a Ritz Carlton - it doesn&#39;t matter and you won&#39;t experience the worse part of flying long haul budget airline - &quot;the crowd&quot;. Sometimes people think crying children are annoying, but it is when you are trying to sleep. When you have audio / video distraction, crying children are minor nuisance. However, poor hygiene begpackers and their youthful emotions - oftne times created much more concerning issues.>>><<<Longest I did was 9.5 hours on Scoot from Sapporo to Singapore. Not that bad until you start running out of water..>>><<<This plane used to fly to Athens before Dingapore for less than 80‚Ç¨. If you are a tall person, 2 hours was ok flying on Scoot, but 12 could be unfathomable. Also not that good food back then, but it was interesting as an experience.>>><<<Paying 300‚Ç¨ as single flight doesn&#39;t even seem that good of a deal. I spent around 660‚Ç¨ from Stuttgart to Singapore via a Transfer in Istanbul for the full flight via Turkish Airlines with unlimited Water and free onboard Meals in basic economy>>><<<Scoot sold me a ticket, then cancelled it when I turned up at the airport. They have no staff, everyone is a contractor who knows nothing. Their  maintenance is probably as good as their customer service.>>><<<2 hour. did it in china with spring airline.<br>i can still accept 2 hour, not any longer<br>to me, for any flight longer than 10 hours should be booked in buisness class, thats why my family do at least>>><<<honestly wouldnt really mind it cuz i would just bring my switch or a book to read in the mean time or just sleep and i actually would get the power outlet to charge all my stuff in case anything happens, but great video nontheless.>>><<<If its REALLY cheap and the gap is really Big between this flight and a more regular economy one, maybe, but just for the comfort and features included with other companies (and mostly free features...), I&#39;ll go with another company than this one (even if there is 2 flights)>>><<<Technically it does cost them something to provide you with power through the socket: a bit of fuel. Because that power needs to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is the engine generators.>>><<<Wasn‚Äôt this channel about silent reviews with captions and steadi-cam style shots? I liked the style better, this is way too in your face...>>><<<I travelled SYD-TXL in 2018 with Scoot. By the time we‚Äôd added on meals, seat selection, and luggage (we were moving, so packing light was not an option) it came out pretty much on par with any other airline cost-wise. Service was average (not bad, but not excellent, no surprises) and in general it got the job done. Nothing to complain about other than everything being‚Ä¶average. Main reason I wouldn‚Äôt fly with them again is that for the same money long-haul you get an overall better experience, or close enough that paying full-service is worth it just for not being so‚Ä¶average. If short-haul no-frills is all you need though, Scoot will get the job done well enough.<br><br>Absolutely not ‚Äúlong-haul Ryanair‚Äù though, as someone said. Ryanair is built around explicitly screwing you while being <b>just</b> good enough at the bare-bones stuff that people can still convince themselves that it‚Äôs worth the suffering. All states quite publicly by its owner, who makes no secret as to the contempt he has for his passengers. Scoot, on the other hand, is just an airline trying its best at the budget end and mostly succeeding. I‚Äôd rather walk than give one cent to the tossers running Ryanair.>>><<<Denying adjustable head rest is just cruel. <br>Turning off the electrical outlets is ridiculous. <br>By IATA rules, airlines are obligated to serve you water for free, by the way.>>><<<So I was about to fly from Berlin to Singapore in Jan 2023 and I was ready to get thecheapest tickets, since I was on a very tight budget. To my surprise, at the time of booking in Dec 2022 the cheapest option was not scoot, but AirFrance (600 EUR to and back, in comparison to 800 EUR to and back for scoot) with a nice layover in Paris, normal recliner seat, two meals etc. I seriously don&#39;t get how scoot is a low cost, if it costs at least 200 EUR or more than a regular airline.>>><<<Huh... 330 euros is still half of my salary üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è>>><<<Scoot on the 787 is a fantastic experience at an amazing price. The 787 is a far superior flight experience than a 777 or A330 or worse a 737. You get heaps of choice of seats from rock bottom pricing which of course will have less leg room to a very reasonable extra leg room quiet area and usually very affordable scoot plus. Scoot runs a very reliable network of flights. You can buy food onboard or before you fly at reasonable prices, it‚Äôs easy to choose your luggage requirements, wifi is onboard and you can also buy drinks. If you can‚Äôt organise yourself to bring your own entertainment or food that‚Äôs on you. Power is available in the seats for a fairly low fee, many planes have no power at all. The ability to buy what you need means you can fly for as cheap as possible or add on what you need. Couldn‚Äôt be more easier.>>><<<Max on LCC for me is 4.5hrs.<br>And yeap airasia is better than scoot.>>><<<Nah thanks, I&#39;d rather have a stopover and pay $100 more and fly with Turkish Airlines instead...>>><<<Next level of payment - for seat, for toilet, for food delivery (you pay for food but not for delivery?), for smile?>>><<<If you don&#39;t have much money you don&#39;t have much choice.<br>Yes I always look forward to the curries on AirAsia .>>><<<11 SGD isn‚Äôt a lot of money because I am from Singapore and a lot of stuff is expensive so 11 SGD is not that much money>>><<<done 7 hrs before, not again>>><<<I tried this airline before and my best advices are :<br> ‚úÖ get an empty bottle so u can fill it after the security process ( i got for me a bottle of 1.5 lts) <br>‚úÖ buy an hamburguer or sandwich ( 3-5 euros ) in the waiting area ( u can eat it in the airplane ) and buy packaged snacks ( u will feel full )<br>‚úÖBring ur laptop or ipad with downloaded movies from netflix or amazon and bring ur own earphones.<br>‚úÖBring ur portatile charger.<br>‚úÖ If u are below 175 cm u wont feel any problem with the seat.<br><br>Services is nice ( i expected a really bad service )<br><br>Good luck ü§û>>><<<will mot fly scoot had 3 very bad experience being overcharged forvsub standard service>>><<<Have flown Scoot a few times in various classes.  Honestly, if the price is right, I would go for Scoot.  Again, I only fly no more than 8 hours.>>><<<Dude that‚Äôs the like the demo aircraft they bought from Boeing and ‚Äúwere like yeah this is good enough‚Äù>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot Silence twice in Sep 2019 and Sep 2022 on the SIN-SYD route. I expected to pre order food, or pay $$$ on board, a little preparation goes a long way if you fill up a water bottle after security. Compared to my onward journey on BA economy, I have to say the Scoot air cabin staff are way more customer focussed than their counterparts. Nothing is ever a problem. I&#39;d defo recommend Scoot for flying on a budget.>>><<<In 2018, we flew Scoot from Manila to Athens via Singapore for less than USD 600 round trip per person. No food, no bags, just seat selection. I&#39;d personally rather fly a full-service airline for that long a flight (especially if I need to bring bags), but if I just need to get from point A to B and I can one-bag the trip, I&#39;d gladly fly them again.>>><<<Bruh I took this route tokyo-singapore-berlin it wasn&#39;t even that bad and plan on doing it again in few months. So I brought some snacks prior to boarding and bought a drink on board. So tell me what are you getting on a full cost carrier that you aren&#39;t getting here?>>><<<Excellent review! Will fly Scoot definitely>>><<<Well for me I fly scoot very often and it‚Äôs normal and not bad for a 3 hours flight from Singapore to Thailand, I just booked a flight in scoot to Thailand and flying scoot is cheap and excellent, why do everyone keep on hating cheap airlines and prefer expensive ones, there are very minimal difference between cheap and expensive airlines>>><<<Can I go also manila>>><<<There was a Low Cost Airline, PEOPLExpress, based in Newark New Jersey they started service April 30 1981 and merged with Continental February 01 1987 they flew Boeing 727-200 Boeing 737-100/200 and 747-100/200 they flew the 747s to London Gatwick and Brussels and on Transcontinental flights I flew them quite a bit they changed for onboard services fifty cents for sodas juice coffee tea peanuts brownies etc snack packs for $6.00 on Transcontinental and International flights the snack packs were more substantial their 747s had first class (they called 1st class premium service) I believe they did show a movie on their 747 flights they charged $3.00 per checked baggage and carryon no charge>>><<<Even Air Asia if from Malaysia cheaper as cost of fuel still subsidised by govn <br>Thai Air Asia flight &amp; food more expensive to Malaysia AA.>>><<<I dont mind paying for food and I can bring a book or Switch for entertainment.

I remember when you had to bring a newspaper, magazine, or book with you if you wanted entertainment.>>><<<Scoot is ok for its price but my problem with them is they are never on time. 13 hour is way too long.>>><<<I fly with them before C19 3x From Berlin to Bali, its very cheap last time, around 400usd two way. I bring to backpack instant food MANA and shaker and thats all üòÄ watter i was take in toilet wastaffel and done üòÄ because they menu is crazy overpriced.>>><<<I fly their 787-9s on Asian mid haul flights all the way before the pandemic, and started again recently as they resumed their 787 services, usually with paid seat upgrades (not exactly tall but my knees are bad).<br>Since most mid hauls in Asia are flown using A32Xs, the 787s are a huge upgrade for me. (don&#39;t get me started on the A32Xneos, it only saves money FOR THE CARRIERS, not for us. If they&#39;re so efficient like the Airbus ads say, why aren&#39;t the tickets cheaper??)<br>Not to mention the narrow body low cost mid hauls aren&#39;t exactly cheaper than Scoot&#39;s 787 offerings. Scoot&#39;s Asian mid haul prices are still extremely competitive compared to full carriers in Asia.<br>But, long haul is a whole other story and I definitely recommend people fully understand since 3-5 hrs and 13 hrs are totally different.<br>I would consider it, but just like the summary, &quot;You get what you pay for&quot;.>>><<<No thank you.  I will only fly on proper airlines.>>><<<Brutally Honest....yes Shit on the sky . I will never pay a dollar for this crampy Flight.>>><<<No thanks. I just couldn‚Äôt face it.

Power provision could be an issue, but forewarned I&#39;d be able to make it with spare batteries including laptop. But really, water is surely a human right and shouldn&#39;t be charge for anywhere.<br>You failed to mention the seat recline situation. How was that?<br>Based on your review, I&#39;d say its doable for me. So thanks, will check it out!>>><<<Faultless review. I agree about the water. That is a bit rich. Is there a water bubbler available to refill water bottles on Scoot? Other airlines have them. As an Aussie when Scoot have a sale it is deadset the cheapest way to get to Europe by a huge margin so we&#39;ll definitely be trying to put up with the discomfort the next time we go. Great review, thanks!>>><<<Never, never never never. I‚Äôd rather pay more for Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines.>>><<<Any ideas what small camera to bring to film a flight>>><<<I recall also having the Mum&#39;s Fried Rice on a Scoot flight from Singapore to Cebu (approx 4 hours) and I recall it as being the worst airline meal that I ever had.<br>Scoot airline is really a low cost airline and I could not imaigne going on a long haul flight with them. <br>I recall from my one flight with them that the aircrew was running around on the flight with no idea on what they were doing and which customers asked for service>>><<<Thank you for the review. <br><br>Perhaps don&#39;t start the video with &quot;Then this video is not for you&quot; as it might put people off actually watching it. <br>People might change their minds on low budget/long haul after seeing the video, or if they have never flown long haul, it might help them decide what will be best for them.>>><<<Thank you, but not thank you. <br>I would prefer to pay a little bit more and pause in the middle of the journey. I can think of Turkish, Emirates or Qatar, for instance.>>><<<I could never fly 13 hours at any price.>>><<<My partner and I flew from Melbourne to Athens return for about $650 AUD each (~ ‚Ç¨410) including seat selection. We brought empty bottles than we filled after security and brought lots of snacks and a tablet with us. The cheapest alternative flights that didn&#39;t involve 2+ connections at the time were close to 3 times the price.<br><br>On the 787-9 used between MEL &lt;&gt; SIN, there are 12 or so seats that have extra leg room and an adjustable head rest for the cost of standard (cheapest) seat selection which are well worth the cost if available.>>><<<Auf gut √∂sterreichisch<br>‚ÄûDo kunnt‚Äòst mi Kasn‚Äú.<br><br>Sowas tu ich mir nicht an üòÑ>>><<<Wow. I&#39;d fly them short distance only. That looked brutal. Thanks for taking one for the team>>><<<I flew Scoot (flight no. TR 611) from Singapore to Bangkok one weeks ago. The tray in-front of seat was never cleaned or sanitized, I was seating near the last row and the toilet smell was leaking even though the toilet door was closed. Its a really awful experience>>><<<i think the bottled water has to be 330ml as it needs to fit into their cart, standing upright. But i do agree that $3 for a bottled water is pricey especially when it is not branded water.>>><<<Amazing how they turn it around so quickly for another flight of 12hours>>><<<It&#39;s never worth it to fly Scoot. Will only take Scoot if the flight is less than 2 hours>>><<<Good God! I would never fly that distance on a shitty budget carrier like that. What a really unpleasant experience that would have been. I guess you get what you  pay for‚Ä¶..>>><<<I would fly on a LCC on this route; AMS-LGW with easyJet (45min). No LCC on longer flights for me.>>><<<great video but really sounds scary :D u did awesome!>>><<<i flew from Berlin to Baltimore with PlayAirlines  no USB no Media or wifi ....fortunately i had my powerbank with me and a lot of movies (Netflix Offline) üòÅ>>><<<I nearly accidentally flew on scoot. $2000 AUD to fly 8 hours to Singapore from Melbourne, on Scoot. Outrageous. Thank god I spotted it, Singapore Airlines trying to cram Scoot into people that are actually booking Singapore Airlines.>>><<<We maybe nice, but we are brutaly true>>><<<For those who love getting charged for 4$ for a small cup of water from scum bags who scan and take your water preflight. Rude staff.  Was the last option but NEVER AGAIN!>>><<<Connection from SIN to Melbourne may be on SQ rather than Scoot itself.>>><<<Nope..I don&#39;t think so..even flying single aisle plane with full service for 2 hours trip is a no no to me if I can avoid it .but unfortunately it is the reality now most airlines now use single aisle planes for medium haul. In Malaysia I did fly AirAsia for domestic trips but that&#39;s only 45 minutes flight.>>><<<Sorry---not sure what your food standards are--but aIR asia WAS NOT better than what you described on scoot.  At least on short-haul-pre ordered meals.(and there too, water is that tiny bottle---and air asia--not sure if they even gave cookies w/the meal(i think just water.)>>><<<Very nice onboard report üòÄ <br> Greetings from Japan üëè>>><<<Never had a bad flight experience with Scoot. Between Australia and Singapore.  BUT of course it&#39;s a lot less shorter than flying with them to Berlin.>>><<<Inspite  of being low cost airlines. Scoot service is quite satisfied , but regarding the meal I felt that airlines need to improve a lot . Recently flew frm Phuket to Singapore and it was a good trip.>>><<<I get that it‚Äôs an ultra low cost airline but being Singaporean, having no food or meals and bring 13 hours, it i was flying with them I would expect a bit more (and you have to pay for the plug socket)>>><<<Scoot in summary, a total disgrace to Singapore airlines üòÖ>>><<<Bro i never went 13 hrs but i took that plane tho>>><<<What ever the airline, longer than 5-6 hours becomes bothersome for me. 12h on a full budget carrier isn&#39;t fun.>>><<<13 hours flight without food or drinks,no entertainment,oh man,it&#39;s torturous, if we take 2-3 hours flights on a low cost flight that&#39;s fine, but for more than 3 hours, you must look for a plane that&#39;s a bit tolerable>>><<<Never buy the tomato chicken ragout from scoot pre ordered meal. Had terrible experiences and family member who had it fell sick for a few days.>>><<<Wow>>><<<I Flew on one they crammed as many seats as possible don‚Äôt even serve water even if you are dying>>><<<Flew Scoot from Melbourne to Singapore during COVID in December 2021. Flights were empty and literally you can lie down on seats.>>><<<Charging passengers to use even power outlets?!?!? No thanks.>>><<<Headrest covers look awful>>><<<i feel the not-so-good quality of nasi lemak was there just to irritate the Malaysians xD <br>joke only, dun take it too srsly>>><<<Where is your strange English accent coming from?>>><<<Not more than 2 hours.>>><<<When I searched trip reports I always see Simply Aviation up top on the list hopefully someday I could be up top too.‚ù§from Malaysia>>><<<Fantastic value. Take your own snacks &amp; water, small blanket and wear more comfortable pants‚Ä¶not denim jeans. Thank you for the insight.>>><<<I did this annually ever since the service started, no issue at all, its a sleep all way journey, I did not even ordered meals. Board, read, sleep, wake up, arrive in Berlin. Same as return.>>><<<LOVING the new intro in the latest Brutally Honest episodes! Fantastic video as usual!>>><<<Have flown Scoot Singapore to Sydney &amp; back a number of times, including their second ever flight. Pay the extra for Scoot in Silence. They are fine, service was good. There short haul flights are not nearly as good.>>><<<My only objections are the charges for power and water. Is water poured in a cup at least free?>>><<<Personally this is a no for me, I don‚Äôt think I could do an ultra long haul on a budget airline mainly due to the leg room (I‚Äôm 6ft3). My longest low cost is 3 hours from D√ºsseldorf to Manchester during my 2018 study abroad. My longest in Regular economy is Milan MXP to Montreal YUL which is 9 hours and it was tight.>>><<<I would try Scoot Premium 3+2+3 upfront.>>><<<Air Asia is much better>>><<<I have a similar route for June, but premium economy with Singapore.<br>Lisbon - (via Germany) Singapore and 4days after New Zealand.<br>I will be able to try the New Zealand Skycoach, but unfortunately de flight back from Singapore to Frankfurt the A380 was replaced by a 777...and I specifically booked to catch the doubledecker...but well. <br>Let me know if you want me to make some clips ahahah ü§£üòÇ<br>Thanks for the clip!!>>><<<I once travelled on Scoot. Undoubtedly my worst flight. I boarded the flight early and very thirsty. Having never traveled on such flight, I casually asked the crew for water only to learn it was paid. Surprising but I said ok, give it to me. The crew then responded that beverage facilities only open became at cruising altitude. I thought I could board off, get water from terminal and come back only to be told that I won‚Äôt be able to board back. So there I sat for 2 hrs, thirsty AF. Finally bought water only to be handed a 300 ml Tetra Pak of water. Views outside the window were nice though.>>><<<Its not bad when you take into account the stop over times. I spent 10hours in Toronto airport which was a horrendous experience going to Lisbon from Halifax which took over 26 hours....a total disgrace.>>><<<I&#39;ve literally just booked a ticket from Athens to Taipei via Singapore with scoot! Looking forward to it! I had a thought, with many of the passengers taking less luggage than usual (often only hand luggage), less people eating, no entertainment system, would this flight consume considerably less emotions than standard long haul?>>><<<I believe Scoot is the low-cost brand of Singapore Airlines? Let me put it that way: Next week I am getting 60. Nowadays, I can afford booking Singapore Airlines at least Premium Economy. But I am an old fart now, made good money in my life. When I was 25, wishing to explore Asia, I would have been glad having something like Scoot, bt that was way before Ryanair changed it all. However, when my son, now in his twenties, recenently travelled to California from Germany, I fronted the 1500 euros to buy him a premium ticket on Lufthansa. There is some limit to all, and Scoot is not an option. But I fully understand there are a lot of people around which simply cannot afford Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines. Good luck to them surving such a flight>>><<<So what? I flew SQ 12 hours before the days of in-flight entertainment on a 707. Literally the same experience with a 3 course meal>>><<<Scoot also flies from and to OOL (GoldCoast)>>><<<No way in hell would I ever get on that flight üôÑ Looks absolutely horrible>>><<<Maximum 4h hours without anything>>><<<I look at the food not nice and water it&#39;s expensive>>><<<If I had to, or it was way cheaper than a standard airline... then, YES!. <br>Given yr able to take yr own food and drink supplies, this makes a better yes.>>><<<The price also doesn‚Äôt look right - I can get full service carrier via a transit airport to have similar price. AirAsia food was amazing when I first tried - also pre-ordered at a good price I clearly recall>>><<<Last year I got this flight for 230‚Ç¨ in total for both directions. Berlin to Bangkok with a short stay in Singapore. Was fine for the price, but not for more money>>><<<Is this still commitment or already masochism ü§£?>>><<<I went on Swoop Airlines Boeing 737-800 from Alberta Canada to Cancun Mexico, it was 5 hours and 30ish minutes, that‚Äôs my LONGEST low cost airline flight.>>><<<Scoot has the most unpleasant-looking, pricey, questionable food I&#39;ve ever consume on a flight.>>><<<12 hours you will never get back>>><<<Bro , can you try new route by Batik Air Malaysia from KL to Melbourne with 737 max>>><<<Eur 350 vs EUR 2600. So figure it>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=160">2:40</a> - Scoot also flies to Coolangatta (OOL) which services the Gold Coast.>>><<<Norse from Berlin to the US is the maximum>>><<<I miss the old Tegel airport. Sure the new Berlin airport looks flashier but it&#39;s not as cozy as the ol&#39; Tegel. Oh well, at least there&#39;s the mega-airport in the German capital of Frankfurt!>>><<<4 hours>>><<<I seen this company on tik tok and there was clouds in the damn planeüòÇ>>><<<WAIT. You have actually changed the intro and started talking instead of subtitles?? Looks like I haven‚Äôt seen your videos for a long time..>>><<<Thanks, I not book at all. I be very close to book a trip to Bangkok via Singapore, but never with bullshit Air Scott>>><<<weird concept. If you book everything you are over 1000eur in may, singapore airlines charges 876 for the same dates.>>><<<Good üëç>>><<<Flew from Singapore to Tokio at the beginning of Feb this year with Scoot.<br>The overall experience was ok, but from Singapore to Tokio, Scoot osnt that much cheaper than e.g. Singapore Airlines, next time i&#39;ll consider them instead.<br>But as someone who flew quite a lot with Scoot i can say especially on short to medium haul flights the experience is quite good for what you pay.>>><<<We are already booked to travel from Singapore to Berlin, Premium Economy.  You are quite right as I too feel I don&#39;t need games and movies.  A book and a good rest is more than sufficient for me.  Again, next  time I would probably travel Economy, no babies section! Thanks for taking the time to enlighten travellers about Scoot.>>><<<Idea : trip report HiFly>>><<<I loved that when you Mentioned Karachi while flying over and shown the beautiful night view of city . Lots of Love from Melbourne Australia. I&#39;m from Islamabad Pakistan but living in Australia now. Also good to see scoot flights experience as I&#39;m flying to Europe by same airline  in May with my family. I got unbelievable deal for whole family tickets. Appreciate your effort. ‚ù§Ô∏è>>><<<Scoot is the worst and most cramped without any leg room at all. Even the lavatories are designed for micro-size people! Don&#39;t fly Scoot unless you&#39;re below 5ft. Most horrible experience in flight!!!>>><<<I flew that exact route once, and then connected to Sydney. While the price was great, I hope to never have to fly Scoot again. It&#39;s the worst service I ever had by far, and I also was very annoyed by the price of water and power outlets and lack of entertainment  üòÇ<br>I can handle all that on a short flight, but in these very long haul flights these little details make it a very unpleasant experience.>>><<<Pure water - ok, gluten free - ?, vegan - ?, halal - ?>>><<<W√§ren noch deutlich mehr Berlin-/BER-Videos m√∂glich und h√§ufiger/regelm√§√üiger?:)>>><<<......REALLY GOOD REPORTAGE..&quot;...THANKS........üëå>>><<<3 hours max>>><<<I would always fly low cost, however i wouldn‚Äôt consider it on long haul flight. My most recent was on Wizzair between Abu dhabi and Vienna. Scoot isn‚Äôt bad either. I tried them before from Chennai to Singapore>>><<<Glad to see you&#39;re back with more Brutally Honest videos! <br>Quick question, do you do all the animation yourself (maps/intro etc). Looks awesome!>>><<<Seeing a heavy Dreamliner performing the steep turn just after takeoff in Berlin is just awesome... Great views! :D>>><<<&quot;No babies class&quot; is an amazing feature>>><<<I will not fly over an ocean in a 17&quot; seat.  It&#39;s business class or nothing.  I cannot afford to buy business class tickets, but I have mastered the mileage game, so my international flights are always free.>>><<<13 hours flight without in-flight entertainment? And no USB charging?<br><br>If I can&#39;t bring a few power banks with me I would probably be bored to death.>>><<<I flew Singapore Airlines First Class Suite to Frankfurt in January. I had a little more leg room...>>><<<Had to catch 2 scoot flights from Vizag to Manila, a 737 and a 321. My god it was the worst time I ever had to spend... Cheap, sure but the quality was atrocious. Would never fly them ever again and not just that, they charged me exorbitant fee for my bag being 3kgs overweight.>>><<<Water should be a basic human right.>>><<<A long time ago I flew London to Sydney Australia return on Air Asia X. I bought a very cheap Blackberry Playbook for the flight and a new Jack Reacher book. I&#39;m 190cm (and about 15kg lighter) , the trip was alright. Not really that much worse than other long haul economy flights. These days the only part of the plane you would get me in long haul would be the premium part or the extra leg room seats. I just flew Ryanair 4hr35m tenerife to Manchester and they would not let me book extra leg room seats as I was travelling with my children. I reckon I am fine for 3 hours of that crampedness. Any more is just too much for me these days.>>><<<Just no.>>><<<Did it back in 2018. It was brutal. On the way back I paid more for the quiet section. My row was empty so I was able to lie down and get quite a good sleep.>>><<<What da hail! You have to pay a holy dime to stay hydrated on Scoot even when they don&#39;t allow water past security! Is this how a budget airline makes you pay more?>>><<<I flew ool to Singapore on scoot, their cheap seats killed my back and their cheap food made me sick‚Ä¶ great flight ü•¥>>><<<For as low as under ‚Ç¨199 it&#39;s a great deal.>>><<<One hour  and that is pushing it>>><<<I flew Scoot from Athens to Bali via Singapore in April 2022 for just ‚Ç¨340 both ways and couldn‚Äôt care less about the lack of the features you get from other long haul airlines. It was just perfect. Love Scoot!>>><<<Pay not much ger nothing.>>><<<12+ hours lowcost is definitely a challenge>>><<<Can you fly on royal air maroc 787-9 long haul ? It would be a great review!>>><<<Pay to use power source? OMG.

Get the power outlet, bring some extra food‚Ä¶ and this would be a very tolerable flight.>>><<<The best pre-purchased meals are to be found on Pegasus Airlines (Do&amp;Co). Incredibly reasonable prices as well.>>><<<Flew them in June of last year when I needed a o/w flight to SIN on short notice (paid through the nose for that). <br>I thought I had done everything right but ended up not receiving the food I had ordered. You won&#39;t even get a cup of water for free (fill up an empty bottle in the washroom (Germany&#39;s tap water is great).<br>Scoot really is the world&#39;s worst airline. The staff cannot fix any issues (&quot;if we give you a meal,it will be deducted from our salary.&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t have to give you water, we&#39;re registered in Singapore.&quot;)<br>The crew doesn&#39;t know the website either. They&#39;re just hired guns with no strong ties to the customer experience.>>><<<tbh I don&#39;t see too much of a problem in the lack of in-flight entertainment, but the lack of wi-fi is bad. and water... just water. howdys from a person with kidney issues.>>><<<I have flown on PIA from Canada to Pakistan, and it is not a cheap flight, however, the product resembles Scoot&#39;s long haul a lot.>>><<<Airasia X KUL to Tehran (already discountiuned in 2018) <br>it was a 8 hrs flight but I enjoyed it <br>On the return to KL i was able to sleep on the whole middle row myself <br>To be honest Air asia&#39;s paid catering are much better than many other ordinary airlines>>><<<Just take a good book with you and download a few Netflix films on your iPad. It wont be that bad. Regarding the food, never once in my life have I had a meal on an airline which I would call ‚Äúgood‚Äù, low-cost or not.<br>Though to be honest, the seats look terrible, like on a bus.>>><<<Not on your life, great vids üòÄüëçüá¶üá∫>>><<<Watched this video 28FEB23. Checked Google Flights for economy tickets on the same route from 10MAR23 returning 20MAR23. Scoot costs ‚Ç¨1,100 bare bones, if you fly via ZRH with Swiss an economy ticket (with meals, drinks, blankets, IFE, checked luggage) costs ‚Ç¨949. WHY would anyone want to fly with Scoot? <br>BTW: ‚Äúcommitment to a good deal‚Äù is the nicest way to describe this BDSM experiment üòè>>><<<12 hours but it has to be a night flight and reach the destination by morning, so i can sleep 3/4 of the flight. the rest of the entertainment would be an iPad and Steamdeck. If i fly scoot for 6 hours and less i usually book the normal isle or window seat and for 6 hours + i book their scoot + because i want to sleep more comfortably.>>><<<I&#39;m impressed with your commitment! Can&#39;t imagine any prima donna reviewers following suit!>>><<<I am 6&#39;4&quot; (193cm) and there&#39;s no way I would take a flight like this one.>>><<<This looks like a nightmare after my flights with Singapore Airlines in business class 2 months ago !>>><<<You are correct you get what you pay for, Scoot and Air Asia are both superb low cost carriers.<br>Asias version of Ryanair.<br>Making travelling more fun for lessüéâ>>><<<We did Narita to Bangkok on Scoot‚Äôs 787‚Ä¶.6+ hours.  We, thankfully, upgraded to SccotBiz and got a little more room and a free (bad) meal, but at least the seat was okay.<br><br>We go to Singapore frequently, so we‚Äôve taken Scoot quite a few times.  If the flight is on a 787 and is less than 3 hours, I can handle it.  They at least have decent seat pitch.  If it‚Äôs on their A320, which has a whopping 28‚Äù seat pitch, I can handle a little over an hour (Singapore to Penang).  Other than that, we look for mainline airlines.  On an upcoming trip, we chose to use Thai round trip from Sing to Bangkok.  If you take account of baggage fees that you have to pay on Scoot, the Thai price was only about $25 more, well worth it.>>><<<Scoot is my favourite low cost airline. In 2019, I scooted from SIN to ATH and enjoyed the flight. As I was on a code share SQ ticket, meals, drinks and a souvenir blanket were included. Yes, I was allowed to take the blanket with me. The flight was overnight and the legroom wasn&#39;t quite enough (I&#39;m 196 cm tall), but otherwise it was a pleasant trip that I&#39;d happily take again.>>><<<Scoot (and other low cost carriers in Asia) forbids passengers from bringing their own food on board. How else would they be able to sell 330ml bottles of water at SGD3 and tiny portions of unappetizing food at SGD15 if they did?>>><<<nice 1<br>the longest i take was 8 hours>>><<<Isn‚Äôt Scoot the airline where you are forbidden from bringing your own food onboard?>>><<<Charging for water on a long haul fly should  be illegal!! <br>I didn&#39;t know and i was totally dehydrated from Perth to Singapore on my way to Athens..<br>just as well was the shorter leg of the trip.>>><<<Low cost carrier for me uhm probably 6-9 hours as I flew airasia from klia to gold coast however it was cramped>>><<<Each time I was considering taking Scoot for the Berlin-Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route, pricewise, it just wasn&#39;t worth it. If I include 1x checked luggage, 2x food, 2L of water and power outlet (all of which are necessary to me), the price turned out the same as with better airlines (Qatar or Emirates). So to me, it never made sense to choose Scoot on this route. Also, a big downside is the missing inflight entertainment. At least make it available as an add-on.>>><<<Providing water on long-haul flights for an affordable price should be mandatory. One of these days someone will pass out due to dehydration, will the mess be worth it? Giving people a liter of water with some crackers will cost them 1 euro.<br>But saving money on IFE is a good idea, it&#39;s definitely not mandatory for people who have their own devices.>>><<<I was fly on Shaheen Air (Semi Low-Cost Carrier of Pakistan Now defunct airline) in 2014 SKT-JED-SKT on A330 &amp; A320 without IFE but they provide free food and water. I also fly on Fly Dubai on SKT-DXB-TIF Route without food and IFE in 2017. So 10 hours in Shaheen Air and almost 6 Hours (excluding transit time at DXB) spent on Fly Dubai.>>><<<Where is the in flight entertainment and you have to pay for the food and drinks üç∏ ü§î>>><<<Scoot sux. U are very brave>>><<<I fly scoot from Singapore to bali  ..4 hrs it was pathetic>>><<<MAYBE i will try to fly with Scootbut really not on such a long flight.

I could fly a budget airline like Scoot for as long as I need to. 12, 13 hours? No problem. It‚Äôs only if I fly with family or friends that I would feel guilty and pay the extra amount to travel on a legacy for a more comfortable trip for them.>>><<<322 euros for such a service is not a normal price>>><<<I would swallow my sleeping pill just after take off.

But I flew with them in 2019 from Honolulu to Osaka for 140 USD + 15 USD for a seat in the &#39;quite zone&#39; which really wasn&#39;t a quite zone because somehow families with small children ended up here. They didn&#39;t allow passengers to eat of drink their own sandwiches and drinks and even cabin announcements were made that according to Singapore law it wasn&#39;t allowed to consume your own food or drinks.

So it might be helfpful to collect Informations about an Airline before you book.>>><<<Really interesting video. How low can they go with standards>>><<<Nah I hate Scoot even fot short haul. My go to is Airasia or Citilink>>><<<No, I will not fly Scoot on such long flight. I flew from Singapore to Sydney on an overnight flight. The seat was very uncomfortable an I had sore back and neck on arrival>>><<<I bring a waterjug thats around 2 of those water bottles.>>><<<Not in a million years. Avoid them like the plague. I&#39;d rather pay more for a reasonable flight.>>><<<Who pays for the power? Just use your powerbank...>>><<<There is even Ryanair better>>><<<Agree about AirAsia food is better>>><<<had a flight from berlin to bkk with scoot in 2022 and it was only 280‚Ç¨ roundtrip, want to have these prices back haha>>><<<Ideally never but if push comes to shove 3 hours max>>><<<I wouldn&#39;t agree about the charging ports. They&#39;re almost never existant on ULCCs so this is a bonus to have. Plus if your business model  is based on absolute minimal costs, someones gotta pay for the installation, maintenance and extra fuel burn from having them. Just dont use them if you dont have to.>>><<<Their 787-800s also flies to Perth Every day !>>><<<Hi simply aviaton can you try new company Airlines in malaysia? MyAirline>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=499">8:19</a> you have to you pay to use the power outlet never flying this airline>>><<<I flew Scoot from ICN-TPE around 7 years ago. It took about 2 and a half hours. Suffice it to say, that was long enough.>>><<<Thanks for this report, perfect as usual üôÇ>>><<<I would fly Scoot. Just for the ‚Äùsilence‚Äù sector. üëç>>><<<Scoot is ok for short haul but not really long haul>>><<<No more than 4 hours and yes, I would have tablet loaded with Movies and Tv&#39;s shows and food and drink!>>><<<Maybe I would fly with full-service airline so I can charge my electronic device and entertain myself. Flying the low-cost airline is okay but only for 3 hours maximum>>><<<Last year I did a 8 hour budget airline flight on Norse from Berlin to Newark and honestly, it was fine. The movies were free, the plane was brand new, the legroom was fine (certainly no worse than a regular airline). The only thing I had to pay for was a meal, which was $20 (and honestly kinda tasty), but considering the ticket was $289 (!) it was well worth it.>>><<<Optimally 90m, maybe 5h-6h transcon/trans-canada at most>>><<<I&#39;d probably say above 4 hours starts to become a bad experience for me. I flew ryanair for that long with my knees pressed against the seat in front. Really uncomfortable by the end of it. Awesome video btw!>>><<<I genuinely think I would be able to handle this lol<br><br>Before the pandemic, every other Christmas break, my parents would take me to China, since that&#39;s where they grew up, and my last visit had been when I was 12 years old. Every single flight I took, I would literally just starve myself for 12 hours straight, since I was and still am a pretty picky eater, and airplane food really just doesn&#39;t appeal to me in general. Air China&#39;s entertainment system wasn&#39;t all that interesting to me either, as it didn&#39;t have games, and all the movies were for grown-ups, and I had no headphones. They did provide pillows, except I ALSO have problems with those too, it&#39;s that I literally cannot sleep on a warm pillow, and it&#39;s why at home, I use a sofa cushion as my pillow since it stays cool for longer. I still tried to sleep though, I would usually just lie down on my mom&#39;s lap the next seat over, and close my eyes, except I was never actually able to fall asleep doing that>>><<<Having flown Scoot 1 year ago, I swore never never never ever again . Even allowing for ¬´¬† you get what you pay for in life¬†¬ª they are a disgrace, abusive, shameful airline. Stay away from them . !!!>>><<<Flying Scoot for long haul is more of a punishment unless you know you have some to expect at your destination. But then you have to fly back on that same cattle car aircraft to get back home. Whatever relaxation to be had is gone out the door. But I can understand if others are willing to put up with it. But lack of water on the flight for free? That&#39;s pretty low. I hope they don&#39;t act like this with their maintenance of their aircraft.>>><<<I sat on a short KUL-SIN flight on scoot in an Exit row and it felt never ending, mind you I would love to try this.>>><<<More airlines should do what Scoot does on their long-haul aircraft. Having a silent cabin is great because one time on a flight there were babies crying so much all the time>>><<<I‚Äôve flown scoot from Sydney to Singapore 3 times and on to Bangkok once, the service is fine as long as you don‚Äôt expect much, I flew once in what they, at the time, called business class and that was a fail. Priority boarding, not done, priority disembarkation, not done, free wifi, broken but it was $3AUD more so I wasn‚Äôt complaining.>>><<<No power unless you pay? My massive Anker power bank finally gets to see some action>>><<<‚ÄúWould you fly scoot-‚Äú HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Terrible experience, I flew the exact same plane (9V-OFI) when it was 2 months old and the cabin was already in terrible condition.>>><<<Absolutely now way I would pay for electric outlet. Long haul without in flight entertainment is a no from me. Just checked and it would be cheaper to take Quatar from Edinburgh to Singapore with layover in Doha than Scoot with layover in Berlin. Ridiculous. Charging for water on a long haul should also be illegal.>>><<<Flappy bird , dude that game has been removed, if scoot offers flappy bird its good enough>>><<<I flew from Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot one time and I love the amount of leg space there is in the scoot silence and peacefulness, but flying 7 hours on a red eye flight without entertainment can be dead boring. Next time I‚Äôll download movies to my device.>>><<<It was the cheap passengers that wanted the lowest fare for creation of no thrill airlines. Of course you have to pay for expensive foods if you paid cheap tickets. We have plenty of cattle class airlines in the U.S.: Spirit; Frontier; Southwest. I don&#39;t feel sorry for poor people suffering.>>><<<I flown once on scoot 787 from Singapore to KL and never again. The plane was is such a bad state, worse plane I ever been on. The arm rest was attached to the seat by silver tape, the wall panels were held in place also by silver tape. The seat in front of me was broken and when someone sat in it, it tilted completely to the left. The wings on the plane were 6 shades of gray. Never again, only time I ever felt scared on a plane. I am a frequent travel>>><<<I wish Berlin would see full-service carriers like Singapore Airlines, Emirates, and Etihad Airways. BER should get many more full-service long-haul flights, apart from Qatar Airways and United Airlines services.>>><<<Most low cost isn&#39;t long haul so you&#39;d rarely get the opportunity to endure it for 13 hours!I think that Scoot do a slightly more upmarket seat which is called Scoot Buisness but it&#39;s more like Premium Economy.>>><<<&quot;The price is right&quot; means that the total cost inclusive of adequate food, water, power outlet, luggage, entertainment is lower than the alternative. I would certainly fly Scoot if the price is right.>>><<<Honestly they seem very reasonable and they do have some impressive fares between Australia and Asia. but thats just me. The only thing I am concerned about is water, I think thats a bit too extreme. Everything else seems tolerable, I can bring my own food to my desired liking, the seats dont look cramped, and the lack of blankets I can dress accordingly or bring my own. Entertainment, I can pack a book and reduce my dependency on a power socket. But bringing water is a hassle since youll need to find someplace to fill it up after security and ensure you have enough for such a flight. Water is inexpensive to provide to pax.>>><<<Having no IFE is not such a big deal.  Back in the day IFE on a B747 meant a movie projected onto a bulkhead screen.  So only some passengers got a good viewing angle.  And the audio was piped through tubes to headphones &amp; quality of the audio was atrocious.  And you could listen to radio shows etc through a menu system.  So, most people brought books to read.>>><<<Excellent review David!üò∏>>><<<I flew Athens - Singapore and had a 13 hour layover in a pay for use lounge. I then flew to Sydney. It was cheap and cheerful and no issues.>>><<<I spent 3 hours on Scoot last year.  NEVER AGAIN.>>><<<Did Boston to Paris via Iceland on Play airlines.  5.5 hours plus another 3.  Longest narrow body I‚Äôve flown on overseas since I was 4 and flew Lufthansa 707 to Germany ( back when flying was civilized).  I‚Äôd say it was so good, I‚Äôd fly another 10 hours with them.  Great legroom and awesome crew and prices on board were very good.>>><<<My longest flight on a lowcost airline was jinair from clark to seoul and it wasnt all bad. There was <b>purchasable</b> food onboard but no plug or entertainment, but i slept through the entire 4 hr flight since it was 2 am üòÖ>>><<<my flight was ok, SIN-ATH.>>><<<If Ryanair would offer longhaul flights, I think this is what it would look like. I don‚Äôt think I would fly on an airline like this for more than 4, or maybe 5 hours.>>><<<Flew London to Bangkok last September. Cheapest flight was on Scoot and it was direct, but I decided to pay ¬£40 more to fly with Gulf Air , with a transfer via Bahrain. It was a great choice. Cheap no frills airlines are great for short haul, but intolerable for 10+ hour flights.>>><<<I loved that thunderstorm while landing>>><<<My longest low-cost flight so far was 5 hours BUD-DXB onboard a Wizzair A321NEO, but at your flight at least you got the thunderstorm for free upon landing XDDDDD>>><<<My longest flight that I have ever been on was 10hr long and it felt like I was sitting in the flight for ever>>><<<I honestly strongly disagree on classifying Scoot as &quot;low cost&quot; or even &quot;ultra low cost&quot;. Same exact thing with &quot;nearby&quot; Jetstar.<br>The biggest supporting fact to this is that those two &quot;low cost long haul carriers&quot; are still in business while Norwegian has gone backrupt.<br>Those two airlines (Scoot &amp; Jetstar) which are always mentioned as example of &quot;low cost long haul thanks to the 787&quot; appear to be low cost because the main comparison is to their parent companies. They&#39;re the Eurowings of Asia-Oceania pretty much: they&#39;re not &quot;low cost&quot; they&#39;re &quot;lower cost&quot; compared to very high prices of their mainline high standard full service parent airlines (Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa).>>><<<Tbh, depends on the plane. If it was a 747-200 or this kind of stuff I could fly it forever. A 737? 5 hours max.>>><<<Doesn&#39;t scoot ban from taking outside food?<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBPc_MwfHyw">https://youtu.be/jBPc_MwfHyw</a>>>><<<Longest flight with a low cost carrier: Sun Country Airlines from MSP to PUJ; 4.5 hrs>>><<<Did Singapore to Melbourne on scoot, 7 hours and that‚Äôs the maximum time I would be on an LCC>>><<<Bruh, literally I can&#39;t be more thankful to you for putting the glimpse of my home city Karachi @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=559">9:19</a> and I bet you have eagle eyes, you even noticed the airport from high above. Can&#39;t wait to see you at Karachi, do try the new airlines of Pakistan. Lots of love and keep making these superb trip reports and brutally honest reviews!>>><<<FlyScoot is better than AirAsia‚Ä¶‚Ä¶<br>BUT AirAsia win for the meal price‚Ä¶.3 times cheaper‚Ä¶..>>><<<I took this flight from Singapore to Berlin (return) in 2019 and paid SGD 545 (or 380‚Ç¨) base fare and I agree with your whole assessment with the exception of in-seat power. Power supply is not a basic necessity and most people bring their power banks so Scoot charging for it seems like fair game as a low-cost carrier. I especially agree with your assessment on the price of water and quality of food. I don&#39;t understand why they can&#39;t emulate AirAsia&#39;s quality. Also, I paid extra for Scoot-in-silence and I can&#39;t recommend it enough. Seats had more legroom but more importantly, you were guaranteed no screaming infant in that section of the cabin or unruly child kicking the back of your seat. Certainly helps with anxiety! In that regard, Scoot may be a better option compared to other airlines (especially SQ where their amenities, quality and portion of food in economy class have been declining since the resumption of travel but their prices have increased substantially). Anyway, thank you for providing a fairly balanced review of Scoot&#39;s long-haul!>>><<<Depends...can you bring food onboard?>>><<<Not only is BER to MEL 13 h + 7 h, it is also a 20h layover in Singapore!!>>><<<Well I guess unless there is a ‚Ç¨200 difference, I&#39;m not flying them. If you can&#39;t sleep during this flight it&#39;s going to be a long 13h>>><<<I‚Äôve been to Berlin and Athens with this Airline‚Ä¶‚Ä¶>>><<<I think I would go for max 3 - 4 hours, maybe 5, but thats really maybe, would have to be such a huge price difference or other flight would be with long layover and etc, 12 hours in low cost, never. Otherwise nice video, I like this series.>>><<<I don‚Äôt think the buy on board prices were bad at all. A 500ml bottle of water is 6‚Ç¨ in Frankfurt. Airport pricing will not save you any money.>>><<<Hey a cabin were baby‚Äôs are not allowed in, I‚Äôd take that>>><<<i‚Äôm greek/australian living in greece but planning to move to australia. i want to go there beforehand and i‚Äôve been trying to find cheap tickets. i was planning on flying with scoot, because of the cheap price, and as im not the most wealthy person, i thought that it was a great deal (before seeing reviews), as singapore stopped flights from athens to there, so scoot is one of the only airlines that connects greece to southeast asia directly (air china costs 1.560e per person‚Ä¶) but honestly i think i‚Äôll just go with emirates. i don‚Äôt think i can survive in that cabin with no amenities and no free food, water and entertainment. would rather pay more>>><<<I flew from Seattle to Frankfurt on Condor! Not anymore!!! Never again! The legroom is horrible, food as well. They do have entertainment screens but they offer only 2 free movies and if you need more, you have to pay 10‚Ç¨ for nothing, literally!!! The worst experience,!!!>>><<<Thanks David for introduce Karachi Pakistan where my residence is>>><<<Max 5 hours>>><<<never ever, no, nein, nie, thats to much, scoot from BER to SIN da w√ºsste ich ein ei am wandern haben. und daf√ºr haben sie aber auch noch einen f√ºr das gebotene viel viel zu hohen preis, oder die restlichen carrier sind zu billig.>>><<<sounds good flight to me......serves a population that wants to fly>>><<<purchase your own food before you board.........and bring a warm coat/etc to sleep in.......>>><<<Such a shame about the mediore food. You&#39;d expect better from a Singaporean carrier of all things, even a budget one, especially as Air Asia really do a fantastic job. I&#39;ve flown on Air Asia and Air Asia X, and their meals have always been fantastic value, and something I actively look forward to when flying with them.>>><<<how about 0.  Ya i would spend 0>>><<<Wow that was a cheap cheap flight>>><<<Hi, pls try FitsAir of srilankas low cost airline>>><<<I fly business class 90% of the time(if available) but this one time I took scoot from Philippines to Singapore and boy did I feel miserable üòÖ I‚Äôm also 191cm and 250lbs. I paid to board 1st but was the last to board üòÆ>>><<<Isn&#39;t it forbidden to bring your own food and water aboard Scoot?<br>Even if you have to buy expensive bottled water after passing airport&#39;s security.<br>But I think it is still cheaper than onboard Scoot.<br>Anyway, I am 63 and I would never ever squeeze me in such a seat for 13 hrs.<br>Thrombosis assured.>>><<<Me and my brother took the exact same flight. The cost was the only good thing about this flight. But you have to pay 11 $ for the most shitty food you will ever get on an airplane. Even Lufthansa serves better food.<br><br>Thanks for making this Video>>><<<I love your brutally honest videos>>><<<Yes  scootüòä>>><<<Cuando est√°s acostumbrado a hacer ayuno el problema de la comida no es el inconveniente, lo del agua si es un robo, y el entretenimiento abordo, bueno es una aerol√≠nea de bajo costo y no puedes esperar mucho, no viajar√≠a con ellos independientemente de que fuera un precio atractivo, la comida prepagada est√° mejor en todos los aspectos en las aerol√≠neas turcas de bajo costo.>>><<<I&#39;d never do it, but I watched the video anyway.  üòä>>><<<Maybe short haul flights but not long hauls! I do not appreciate the cost of water and power outlets!<br>Thank you sir for the option to share us your report!>>><<<I probably will have some PTSD after that 13 hours flight>>><<<This is what flying long haul with Ryanair, Easyjet, Wizz, or Spirit would look like. Shudders.>>><<<I don&#39;t think the power is free at all.  My guess is they aren&#39;t running that on batteries, but on jet fuel that&#39;s converted to electricity.  In that case it&#39;s expensive electricity.>>><<<Im an alcoholic so I dont care ill take the cheapest flight then get wasted and fall asleep>>><<<What a shameee!!! These airlines should bankrupt! I hate low cost carriers, they changes the way of flying‚Ä¶>>><<<The only way I would fly a discount airline that kind of distance is in their premium cabin, otherwise I&#39;ll pay the extra couple of hundred bucks for more comfort, an entertainment system, free meals and all the water I want.>>><<<That‚Äôs the saddest economy class I‚Äôve ever seen>>><<<Hut ab.. und ich reg mich schon auf, weil ich naechste Woche mit Norwegian von Stockholm nach Helsinki fliegen muss....>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=647">10:47</a><br>That isn‚Äôt entirely true. The power outlets themselves cost money to install and maintain. <br><br>But the price they are charging is very high.>>><<<Great review of Scoot, David! I fly with Scoot quite often as they are based in Singapore and you really pay for what you get. The cabin crew are quite good imo.>>><<<Tomorrow I&#39;ll give Scoot a try, flying ScootPlus from Hangzhou to KL for around 410 AUD one way.>>><<<My family tried to check the price to book scoot and jetstar last year when we went to sg from manila ph. It was very high compared to singapore airlines. So we just booked Singapore airlines instead.>>><<<Not more than 3 hours :D>>><<<Maximum time is about 10 hours on Thomas Cook Scandinavia from Cancun to Copenhagen, it was awful, was either really hot or really cold the food was the best part but they didn&#39;t come round offering drinks. I was second to last row so I could grab some snacks and water though. The orange juice for the breakfast was still frozen solid.>>><<<I see, you could only afford Scoot because you maxed out the budget on that sick intro.>>><<<Great flight. Imagine you didn&#39;t pre-ordered meal, you&#39;ll be training for fasting on board.>>><<<My maximum would be 4 hours>>><<<With easyjet Ryan air and Co not longer than 3 hours. Longhaul only in a premium cabin probably as the legroom in economy is already tight with full fare carriers. I can bring my own food or purchase it plus I have my tablet anway.>>><<<I did the SIN-MEL flight in the middle seat. It wasn&#39;t THAT bad but god damn you are crazy for doing 13 hours on Scoot.>>><<<Bring an empty one litre bottle through security and fill it up before boarding. For $10 you can buy more than enough bread, cheese, meat, granola bars and snacks for the flight. 50ml bottles of vodka cost about $1 at a liquor store and are legal to carry on board.>>><<<Scoot apparently doesn‚Äôt allow you to eat your own food onboard, which is mind blowing to me.>>><<<I&#39;d fly scoot just for the experience of flying a new airline>>><<<I said to myself all along that &quot;Yeah, would pay for it.&quot;<br>But asking money to use power outlet....Literally the energy is generated by the engines...If noone pays for it, they wont just turn it off... Would never fly with them because of this.>>><<<Scoot delivers what it says it will deliver except that its prepaid meals are not very good. The cabin crew is also aloof.  Air Asia gives a similar deal but with delicious meals and friendly cabin crew. They also offer their Premium Flatbed seats which are similar to business class comfort.  I look forward to more long haul flights being introduced by Air Asia.>>><<<Talking about water, look at how much Qatar charges you at Doha during transit. Paying for water on a transit hub is stupidity considering how high they price their tickets. To add to that, the security makes you dispose your pre-bought water bottles at entry.>>><<<After reading Scoot airline web site and the part about food and drink, i think travellers will be in for a huge surprise, in that it says consumption of food and drink from outside of the flight is not allowed to be eaten or drunk on board, i love to know how the flight crew would in force this rule as i could see many people on board having their own stuff. Strange this wasn&#39;t mentioned in this review.>>><<<Unfortunately, I‚Äôm flying with them in April from SIN to ATH so thank u so much for showing so I can be prepared‚Ä¶ especially for the water ! üòÜ>>><<<If the price is good and flight available in our country I will fly with sccot>>><<<322 EU for a one way ticket ain&#39;t really &quot;cheap&quot; either...>>><<<Ah...

After a 4.5hr at the start of the journey (with no vouchers), I would have expected to get a cup of water on board.>>><<<13 Hours ???  I wouldn&#39;t set foot in a 787 NightMare Liner (aka ScreamLiner) for 13 seconds.  Give me an a350 anyday.>>><<<I went to Australia and back for less than ‚Ç¨600 with this airline on this route - if all you want is to get from point a to point b then its perfect. It is simply a long haul Ryanair. Thank you scoot for making worldwide travel available for everyone. (Also the same route with other carriers was at least double the price - so not worth it for just some unnecessary luxury extras)>>><<<Their is no way I could take a flight like this. 7euros for power? Wow, I&#39;ll pass.>>><<<respect. would be ok with it if i could bring my own food>>><<<I remember flying Etihad from Belgrade to Singapore in 2018 for 350 euros. Good old times.>>><<<Great review David! If it were short haul, Scoot would be a good choice if prices are low, but Long Haul, probably not.>>><<<6 hours edit: Scoot silence is GENIUS and every airline needs it +1 point for scoot>>><<<5 hours top!>>><<<Flying with Scoot in May, glad to hear they have Wifi as I will have work to do!>>><<<I&#39;m flying to Singapore in a little over a week, but to XSP and not SIN üôÉ>>><<<Low cost over 2h is a big no!>>><<<Wait, I thought Scoot prohibits bringing your own food and water on board?>>><<<Great video.<br><br>My flight from Berlin to Athens on Scoot (during covid) for 50‚Ç¨ was enough for me to figure out i rather fly other airlines on long haul flights.<br>Sometimes if you look up the prices the base ticket without food, luggage or entertainment is just a bit cheaper than other carriers. Not worth it in my opinion.>>><<<If I could get one of the recliner seats for less than economy on a full-service airline, I would definitely fly with them. If that wasn&#39;t an option, it would have to be cheap enough that I could still buy things like meals and an aisle seat for significantly less money (hundreds of dollars less) than others.>>><<<Yep, if the price is right, I think it&#39;s worth considering Scoot. Otherwise...nah.>>><<<No tv on bord ? It&#39;s low cost but 12 h they Can add TV>>><<<Nah, I will definitely choose AirAsia over Scoot ü•≤>>><<<Love the sound of  an airline banning baby&#39;s from sections of aircrafts I would pay the premium for not sitting near a baby>>><<<As Carol Burnett once said to a Passenger. Excuse me Sir are you flying in the not frills Section ?.  Well yes. <br>OK then get your foot of the rug. <br>üòÇ>>><<<I would not spend a minute on a low cost carrier, I only chose traditional airlines.>>><<<I mean sure, flights from europe to singapore are really expensive, so yeah I would still probably fly with them>>><<<Woah‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 13 hours is insane. I flew them for 8 hours and was already regretting it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ good job though!>>><<<Great review üòÄ I have flown this exact route myself back in 2018 from the old Tegel Airport. And just as you say you get what you pay for and in my opinion Scoot makes this very clear in the booking process. As for the power outlets, just use a power bank üòÄ If you are traveling with checked in bags it may actually be worth comparing flights with other non LCC airlines as it may actually cost more or less the same>>><<<What next, charge extra for using the restroom?>>><<<OK but like I wanted to go to Singapore so badly that I would actually take a cheap flight to Berlin and then do this. I don‚Äôt live in the United States so low cost is very easy to get to Berlin.>>><<<flew SQ325 FRA-SIN on 23/02/23. Water was served from pitchers, not bottles. When dinner was served, I asked for a Beer and was told that they have run out of bier. SGD$600Mil+ profit in the last quarter and all the cost cutting = no bier. Now we know why we are no longer #1. May as well just Scoot.>>><<<The silence seat is worth every penny.>>><<<Bro did for usü•∫>>><<<never put your feet on any long haul budget airline, it will make you feel miserable.>>><<<I took Scoot on a fifth-freedom flight from Berlin to Athens one year ago, which obviously wasn&#39;t such a bad experience compared to the other options you have on this route. But I seriously can&#39;t imagine to be onboard their Boeing 787 for 13 hours! So thanks that you sacrificed yourself for me...üòÇüôå>>><<<Indigo offers much better meals. I rather have their sandwiches than Scoots meal.>>><<<Back in February 2020 (just before Covid hit) my parents and I were on vacation in Indonesia. We were checking flight offers from Berlin (still TXL back then) to Denpasar and were actually considering Scoot for a moment. I watched a trip report on their 787 too, I think it might&#39;ve even been on this channel. We decided against it eventually, especially because my mom wouldn&#39;t agree to spending 12+ hours without entertainment. When we finally went to Indonesia again over Christmas 2022, almost 3 years later, we still decided for full service airlines instead. It&#39;s worth the extra money to us xD<br><br>The longest low cost flight I had so far was on EasyJet from Berlin BER to Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt, around 4 hours of flight time time (+ the return flight obviously). Yea, that was painful enough, I think the longest I&#39;d agree to would be 6 hours>>><<<Anything more than 3 hours on an LCC is a big NO for me.>>><<<I would go absolutely mad being on a flight that long with no in-flight entertainment.>>><<<Thanks David for this report.     I would have to be in a desperate situation to fly Scoot or any similar cheapie airline on long haul.     Short haul would be OK, but that&#39;s it for me.   I rather pay money and have a pleasant experience.>>><<<Seems better than US economy flights>>><<<Decend not approach>>><<<On December 2022, I have ever tried flying Scoot 787-8 9V-OFE from Osaka Kansai to Singapore Changi for 7 hours, and I even sat at the same seat as you: 33K! (sadly it&#39;s a different plane). But the flight did not feel good. I was so bored during the flight, and thirsty as well.>>><<<Im totally convinced that people that choose this airline knowingly, just hate themselves. I wouldn‚Äôt even get on a scoot longhaul flight even if you paid me.<br><br>So thanks for your sacrifice üòÇ>>><<<maximum 4 hours, especially not on scoot>>><<<You advised passengers to bring their own food and drink. Does Scoot allow that now? In other reviews I saw, it was said that Scoot had a strict policy of forbidding the carrying and consumption of any outside food and drink, with angry crew confiscating the product and, if they saw it before takeoff, even threatening to expel the passenger from the plane.>>><<<Never.>>><<<Very nice low price! üòÄ>>><<<Man... that kinda suck Can you make a Brutally Honest on Norse? Or Your Turkish Airlines Buisness Class on their A350-900 From Istanbul-Johanseberg.>>><<<You took one for the team!>>><<<I‚Äôd consider myself as a price conscious traveler but I think low cost on a long haul flight is something I‚Äôd not be willing to do.<br>Thanks for providing this excellent, honest review>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot before. To and fro Langkawi, Da Nang, Hanoi and Bangkok (on their 787), all pretty short hops. They were pretty bearable, it got us from point A to B without much fuss. However beware of delays like one I experienced on the return leg from Bangkok - I&#39;ve heard of some that can get as long as a day or even cancelled. Scoot is mainly infamous for its delays. I&#39;ve been lucky enough not to experience that long of a delay - only a couple hours wait. All in all, if you&#39;ve got enough entertainment and food, fly Scoot if there is no other option. However if there are other options such as Air Asia (anywhere within ASEAN, NOT AIR ASIA X) or Zipair (3 times a week flights to Narita), fly those instead. I seriously can&#39;t bear 10-13 hours on a Scoot flight, let alone it being delayed.>>><<<I‚Äôm sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk?>>><<<I‚Äôm sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk?>>><<<I can&#39;t imagine flying on that... holy... <br>If I fly 14 hrs on emirates a380 and its still tiring af, imagine on a scoot 0_0>>><<<I used to fly scoot biz<br> from Melbourne to Singapore pre Covid. It was comfortable and a good price. Haven&#39;t flown them since>>><<<Scoot is probably the worst airline I‚Äôve ever been in. Pathetic seats on the 787 that lack any lumbar support or headrest and the arrogant staff.>>><<<Scoot&#39;s website says that you are not allowed to bring your own food and drinks on board. I will give this poor excuse for an airline a wide berth. Take an alternative route>>><<<If the price is right, I would fly with Scoot. I would definitely consider upgrading to that Scoot-in-Silence cabin. Extra legroom seats, private cabin and like David mentioned, adjustable headrests. The one on the 787-8 is particularly good. I‚Äôm waiting for an opportunity to try it myself. The ground service is where the airline falls down on bad days, so that‚Äôs one thing to consider too.>>><<<imo good food keeps people happy. The very least that scoot can do is improve the catering, because just by looking at it, I lost all appetite lol>>><<<Someome said it<br><br>Airasia meal better scoot<br>Mean MY food fair better than SG üòÇüòÇüòÇ>>><<<air-Asia was first  based in Malaysia it explains the better food and its current hub is Indonesia which also has great food :&gt; nah just kidding Singapore airlines has pretty great food.>>><<<Amazing content David! Must have been exhilarating to be landing in a thunderstorm!!>>><<<nice bro>>><<<Maximum 4 hrs are my limit on Low Cost Airlines.>>><<<My longest flight with a low cost carrier was with Norwegian between Copenhagen and Los Angeles. As long as you know it is taking 11 hours, you brought your own food purchased at the airport, which is better than the one served or purchased on board, you have your iPad with movies and a book. A similar experience than with a regular airline in Economy especially after the pandemic where many perks are axed.>>><<<Nasi Lemak is from Malaysia not Singapore>>><<<LETS GO IM EARLY AGAIN>>><<<Super Video David! :-)>>><<<This is the sad and bad part of singapore airlines that they dont hope we see. Scoot is owned by parent company Singapore airlines. Singapore airlines (SIA) is such a good airline but its sad to see them do such money grabbing things like power plug charges and bottled water prices being so high (on SIA power and water is free) if SIA made power free and water way cheaper that would really make the WHOLE Singapore airlines corporation truly, a great way to fly. For now it seems that they are pouring everything they have into SIA which is not bad either but a little attention to the budget side of SIA will do it some good. I personally have never flown scoot (i cant handle without IFE soryyyyyy) I almost always fly Singapore but i wouldn&#39;t mind trying them on short hops to places like Malaysia in the future. Lastly thx for ur review :D<br><br>-love from Singapore :P>>><<<I have never seen any airline that CHARGES you to use a power outlet. That‚Äôs outrageous>>><<<I‚Äôm planning on living in Australia for university next year so as I‚Äôm from Europe, I guess I‚Äôll need to book a Scoot flight üò≠üíÄ>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc">0:00</a> Let the 12h torture begin>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot from Singapore to Gold Coast and that was a interesting experience.>>><<<Dude literally sacrificed 13 hours for the bros>>><<<Please review about Cambodia Angkor air !>>><<<5-6 hrs>>><<<Flying with them in April and doing Sydney to Singapore and I am looking forward to seeing what it‚Äôs like>>><<<Ah yes. Thanks for reviewing Scoot as I plan to fly with them on my trip to Australia. Those fees for water and power outlet are indeed‚Ä¶ outrageous. I‚Äôd rather fly with Cebu Pacific if I have the luxury of time (which they don‚Äôt provide as they are notorious for being the least punctual airline in Manila).>>><<<I love you David! Simply Aviation>>><<<I‚Äôm actually so glad that you guys did a Brutally Honest episode on Scoot! As a not-so-rich Singaporean, I frequently fly on Scoot to visit my family in China since they were the only airline that operated direct flights to those cities in China. Which basically means I frequently fly 8.5 hours on their 787 and 5.5 hours on their A320 (which is very painful). It‚Äôs definitely not ideal, but its like the only thing I can afford.>>><<<Water bottles should be complimentary>>><<<How did you survive such a long flight without any form of in-flight entertainment haha. Great video as always!!>>><<<That‚Äôs what we call Taking one for the team. Sacrificing yourself for twelve hours in ultra low cost long haul so we the subscribers don‚Äôt have to! You have achieved boss status!>>><<<I flew scoot from Berlin to Athens last year. Good enough for the 3 hours, but I don‚Äôt think I would want to fly the entire way to Singapore with them>>><<<War der Flug nicht trotz des Inflight Wifis furchtbar langweilig???<br>Und wird das Philippine Airlines MNL - JFK Video ein Tripreport oder ein Brutally Honest Video sein? (Ich w√ºrde Tripreport favorisieren...) Wie immer, sehr gutes Video!>>><<<Scood is in polite...ü§≠ And  Mum&#39;s Fried Rice.. ü§£ ü§£ ü§£. My Mom doesn&#39;t cook fried rice but pasta.. ü§£>>><<<Damn....I would save more then, would NEVER fly an ultra long haul on Scoot!>>><<<I‚Äôve flown Scoot from Sydney to Singapore in the fly in silence cabin . The food was pretty dire and on our flight we weren‚Äôt allowed to take one‚Äôs own food on board , however , having said that , for the price we paid it was good value and I‚Äôd do it again .>>><<<They charge for power outlets??>>><<<Actually i don¬¥t really need IFE or Food for 12h. I can use my tablet computer to entertain myself and bring a few snacks with me to keep me from starving.<br>My major issue with Scoot is about the legroom. Being 190cm tall, there is no way to stay on this plane for longhaul.<br>What i really love is the silence area. Every airline should introduce an area, where no small children or drunk douchebags are allowed.>>><<<Mein Beileid.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=433">7:13</a> Actually, Scoot will ban you for bringing outside food and drink, which is a really disgusting rule.>>><<<I would go crazy, this gives me flashbacks to Air Canada Rouge>>><<<Nice trip report David! Looking forward for this ‚ù§>>><<<Scoot is one of the best LCCs around. It could rival some full service airlines in some countries.>>><<<&quot;I loved Tegel airport&quot; said no Berlin resident ever>>><<<I have been in one of Scoot&#39;s business-class flights from Singapore to Hangzhou a couple of years ago. The service was good, but to my surprise, there was no USB port on the seat while the AC power outlet was offered.

It was my first international solo trip and the airfares cost me $900 (including a checked bag and seats) and I could not fault any of the segments. The aircrafts were clean and each flight departed and arrived on time. I haven&#39;t had the chance to fly them again, but will when airfare prices &quot;normalise.&quot;>>><<<So you can take a backpack without paying for it more right?>>><<<but u dont mind how cheap it is right ? dont complain if you want champagne then pay for it  otherwise you get soda water ..ive been on scoot 8  times and its never failes to be a success .... really speaking apart from the seats which i get a blow up cushion and turn it into first class .. the rest is the same plane as SQ or Qantas ...>>><<<Dear Josh Cohill it&#39;s very enjoyable beautiful interesting video of Scooty Airlines. Love üíï Regards !>>><<<One time Scoot but never ever again. Have travel Europe - South East Asia ten Year so have some experience. Why Scoot do everything to make it worst than they need. For that cost they AT least can try. But they failed, we will see for how long they last. Even Air Asia, Cebu Pacific do it 100 Times better. But on The long haul flight to EU i choose a premium flight company.>>><<<Think you just saved me a lot of unnecessary headaches. Was considering Scoot as it&#39;s around $350aud Syd to Manila as opposed to around $700+ for Qantas. After watching this, I think I&#39;m just gonna pay the extra haha.>>><<<The Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines on this plane are awful too>>><<<Great video, but I beg to differ. For full service airlines, I have higher standards. For Scoot, as a budget airline, it&#39;s fine. I flew an A319 from Hong Kong to Singapore on Scoot after the Tiger merger and even that was adequate as I already ate in the terminal anyway. The seats on the 787 in regular economy were just fine.>>><<<please take jetair, you will know austrilia buget airline is more suck>>><<<Scoot sucks big time. Flew them once and will never repeat that hopefully. Dirty cabin, filthy floor and when asking for a cup of water (for medicine) was told I can buy a bottle. Spent the best part of the first hour arguing and waiting for that cup, until they eventually delivered it... <br><br>Luggage measurements and weights are also anally enforced, even it was exactly 400g over the cabin limit. 120 USD extra?! Come off it!>>><<<What music was that in the intro.>>><<<This is why scoot has the world‚Äôs worst b787 Dreamliner because it is a budget airline>>><<<AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.. Scoot lost my Armani coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and they refused to compensate for the loss. I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.>>><<<Love    you    to      Bits     Josh  xx>>><<<Dude I always fly on scoot>>><<<I flew scoot gold coast to singapore. 13hr stopover and then 11hrs to Athens. It was pretty uncomfortable but cheap. They didn&#39;t have the padded head rests too.>>><<<With Jetstar i cant choose my seat without paying either>>><<<I also spent a bunch of hours on the Athens Airport due to an early morning flight. It was because of my flight from Athens - Paris (layover to get from Paris to LA) got cancelled and was rescheduled 2 days after, and since uber wasn‚Äôt a thing and i didn‚Äôt had cash anymore my wife and i decided to be at the airport since the night before üòÇ<br><br>It was like 10 hours. I was torture>>><<<I mean, you can‚Äôt pick your seat paying Basic Economy, i just flew Delta, KLM, Aegean, Austrian and Lufthansa last march and i couldn‚Äôt choose without paying extra>>><<<YNWAüòÅ>>><<<Nooooo>>><<<What did you call scoot üòÇ>>><<<u flew a llc, tf were u expecting? a red carpet and all first class lie down seats?>>><<<They lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate.

No big deal. But when I asked for a confirmation letter from Scoot for my insurance claim, they refused to give it even when the governing laws (I&#39;m flying from Malaysia) by the Malaysian government that they are legally required to provide letter within 7 days if the flight delayed more than 30 minutes. My flight that caused the misconnection was delayed for 2 hours. Until now, they still refuse to provide me with the misconnection letter. God, just a confirmation letter for misconnection, there&#39;s no monetary liability for them, yet they refuse to provide. Don&#39;t fly Scoot, or even Singapore Airlines, period.>>><<<It took 3 hours for us to get a water on scoot>>><<<Try also myairlines>>><<<Scoot airline food is good but other things suck>>><<<I‚Äôm a small person so the cabin size really doesn‚Äôt bother me. My tips is bring cash/card. Otherwise you will be thirsty.<br><br>But overall I think my experience with Scoot is good. You get what you get pay. Cabin crews are all polite to me üéâ>>><<<Asian version of Spirit and Frontier Airlines in the US üòÅüòÅ>>><<<Don&#39;t fly Scoot. Flew with them on 21 December 2022 from Bangkok to Singapore. <br>I paid for extra leg room seats for myself and 12 year old son in the middle row of their B787 Dreamliner.<br>After settling in the flight attendant requested that we both move to a window seat near the exit because a Singapore family needed our seats. <br>I stated to the attendant that my son was only 12 years old and that seemed like no problem.<br>Once seated in the new seats we were then approached by the senior attendant who looked at my son and said &quot; you can&#39;t sit in this seat because you are under 18 years of age&quot;<br>I complained and asked if he could be moved to business class in compensation.<br>The response was &quot; that&#39;s impossible , you can contact Scoot for a refund&quot;<br>Now I know this wasn&#39;t going to happen as the attendant offered no proof of the switch.<br>I am confused why my Australian child sitting in their correct seat  had to swap seats with a Singapore child .<br>My son was forced to sit in a cramped row behind his original seat.<br>Next time I fly I will pay more to keep my blood pressure in order.>>><<<Don&#39;t know why OVER Rated Singapore Air merged with known HORRIBLE/ OBNOXIOUS Scoot , that served JAIL Food and FOCUSES more on selling Duty- Free goods ?>>><<<Instead of charging customer ridiculous price on the refreshments, ended up no one buying them, why wouldn&#39;t airliners charge them at reasonable cost with more customers buying them?>>><<<Koper saya ilang naik.scoot 5 bulan lalu sampai sekarang ga ada kabar.ditelpon diemail, ga.dijawab. sy udah masukin ke media konsumen dan laporkan kemenhub karena scoot sepertinyalepas tangan>>><<<AND MY BROTHER SAID THAT SCOOT IS BETTER THAN SINGAPORE>>><<<Great review. üëè   Just wondering, If your flight was at 0700 why did you get there so early ? Why not get up early at the hotel and then head in ?>>><<<Bro your soundtrack on this flight sounded like spyros the dragons soundtrack lol>>><<<Can you charge your phone? And would also like to know if the front row seats (seats without seats directly in front of them) include tray tables? Thanks>>><<<Sydney to Singapore on Scoot costs $303.00 AU. Sydney to Singapore on Qantas costs $679.00 AU. You get what you pay for.>>><<<fun fact they sell single trip economy ticket to china at 4K SGD in sept 2022 in its normal eonomy class sit>>><<<Is the student offer valid on scoot airline if the the other half of my journey is with Singapore airline??>>><<<I think you are wrong about the chair not reclining, there&#39;s a grey button on the side of the arms rest which gives u a few cms of recline. Great videos love watching them>>><<<Josh you are a legend old chap.>>><<<Still better than ryanair>>><<<The absolute biggest issue with Scoot is that they force you to take off sleeping mask and any headphones during start and landing, 30 minutes before landing. So a possible 4h sleep quickly becomes 2h, which is awful>>><<<in the video it shows you did managed to recline the seat.  It is.normal in any airlines that the last row can&#39;t recline.<br><br>thus makes the reporting inaccurate>>><<<It‚Äôs like 1 hour haha>>><<<My wife and I picked up return flights from Sydney to Vietnam for $501 each. Saved at least $900 compared to another airline we were going to fly on. Yeah 8 hours or so from Sydney to Singapore. Not a big deal.. Take your own blanket, snacks, travel pillow and entertainment... 13 hour lay over in Changi.  (Changi is a mini holiday resort) and then another 3 1/2 hours to Hanoi. Its like Ryan Air for Asia. We travel light. No Check in Baggage. For the price it&#39;s pretty awesome. As long as I get there on time and don&#39;t end up at the bottom of the sea. I wouldn&#39;t consider if for a long haul though.>>><<<nice informative video sir I have question is it allow trustiest visa to go out from Singapore airport ?>>><<<with the money you save you can buy food and a ipad to take with you.>>><<<Flew Scoot in late 2017, Singapore to Manila. My baggage check in baggage was overweight. I was willing to pay for extra baggage allowance  but the ground staff was so nice and friendly and suggested that I put some in my hand-carry bag instead to avoid paying extra.<br><br>That&#39;s excellent customer service and I still remember it up to this day.>>><<<I flew Scoot from Sydney to Singapore. Nice clean efficient plane, baggage allowance was good but that&#39;s it. So you take a book or an iPad or try to sleep. I could even put up with their over-priced food but the problem is the food is terrible. If they are going to rip you off for the food they could at least serve something decent. Apparently Scoot is known for their awful food.>>><<<scoot is a great airline for price>>><<<Don&#39;t expect much from a budget airlines. Lovely airlines but ...but..but....a lot of buts ...>>><<<Save üí∏ I booked a flight and did not see the second leg was scoot üò° l booking with Singapore ..but The second leg was with scoot  NOT Happy>>><<<The ground staff in scoot Airlines is very Bad!!!! They didn&#39;t ask that we are transit from Dubai and also have a formal email that we are transferred from one airline to another. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª>>><<<I flew Scoot from Singapore to Kuching and vice versa.  I am impressed with the service, reliability and price.>>><<<Badddd...baggages of mine and my friends&#39; from wherever the country is....got stuck in Singapore, the baggages are not extended automatically to the destination countries...we re disappointed....and reporting to customer care is useless..no reply>>><<<Scoot are what they are, you know up front what you get for your dollars, its a BUDGET airline FFS.>>><<<I‚Äôve flown Scoot on several occasions now, more recently from Perth to Singapore with a connector to Penang last week. I was able to select my seat but pay for it. I selected seat 44A which did recline and the extra space next to me was great. I arrived in Singapore @ 12am with the next flight departing @ 9am, so I feel your pain. To ease things I booked into the Plaza Lounge (S$80) which was over priced, over crowded, the food was terrible, bar closed and I couldn‚Äôt sleep as one guy was snoring, keeping everyone else awake. At least he got some sleep. The only good thing was the shower which was well worth the wait. Definitely not worth the money. Not sure if it‚Äôs due to Covid (I personally don‚Äôt think so) but the overall Scoot service and onboard catering is terrible. In addition, my booking was duplicated due to a processing glitch and was told by the CS agent that I would incur a  S$50 fee for a refund. Common sense prevailed after a vigorous discussion and getting her to check with a supervisor, I was advised a fee would not be charged but the refund would take 6-8 weeks. I still have another month to wait for a refund. Also, I had to send an email to cancel the duplicated booking a week after they told me it was cancelled. Still no written response to my email. Totally disappointed with their overall performance‚Ä¶. It seems to have really gone downhill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Not a great way to start a relaxing holiday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..>>><<<I had no problem with flying Scoot.<br>I got what I paid for &amp; they delivered.<br>The Dreamliner is modern. &amp; I paid a little more to choose my seat.<br>In the quiet section. I met a married couple &amp; we drank and forgot we were in the quiet section üò±üòÇ<br>&amp; were asked to quiet down. <br>Which was a bit embarrassing for me. I‚Äôm not usually the noisy passenger‚Ä¶.but we were enjoying ourselves. I‚Äôd fly them again. <br>I‚Äôve flown them 4 times.>>><<<I&#39;ve had several scoot flights. All of them were great value e.g. Singapore - Berlin direct flight for 158‚Ç¨ back in 2018. Our seats has always been assigned together. Regarding the food: it&#39;s always expensive in the airplanes. Simply bring your own food. By now, they do have board entertainment which you can access with your phone. Flying with a low cost airline with having so many expectations is ridiculous>>><<<Really,  it&#39;s most bad airline fucking airline>>><<<I flew with Scoot earlier this year, I have no complaints for a budget airline, try one of the others and you will stop complaining.>>><<<I helped my colleagues claim lost baggages when they flew with Scoot. Twice!.>>><<<scoot is called a budget airline for a reason lol>>><<<World bad assssss scoot my foot <br>I lost my mony 60 k in march 2022<br>Poorest service never book your flight on scoot>>><<<Flied Scoot many years ago with my kids.  Booked online and was checking out to make payment when prompted to add on inflight entertainment using own devices.   Accepted add-on then complete the payment.<br>Once on plane, inflight didn&#39;t work. Staff then showed list of compatible devices. Felt cheated. Asked for refund. Negative. Asked to replace with food. Negative. Only given a email address to write in. Wrote in. Help desk from Philippines called. Complained that during booking, not highlighted about list of compatible devices. Help desk could not do anything. Lesson learnt...marketing not connected with operation.>>><<<Scoot is a low cost airline and they do a great job, but you seem to be expecting the services of a full service airline at the price of a budget airline. That is a little ridiculous>>><<<best airport to spend a night at>>><<<Love it when you said, &quot;Scoot, get your shit together!&quot; Great video as always, Josh!>>><<<Just booked a flight from Bangkok to <a href="http://perth.at/">Perth.At</a> $370 it was less than half the price Thaiairways charge at $800.Also Thaiairways don&#39;t offer a flight to Perth now.Thaiairways owe me $1000 after they cancelled my flight in 2020 because of Covide.They won&#39;t give me a refund,just a $2000 option to fly to Sydney.They can fuck off ! Subscribed.>>><<<My Best lowcost flight was a Gulf Air HkK to Bkk leg and i got laid by the Czech Cabin girl that night. We arranged to meet as they had a lay over!!!.. LOL.. Excuse the Pun.>>><<<You‚Äôre really milking it. To all the viewers feel free to skip the first 7 minutes>>><<<That meal they served me was the worse airline meal I ever ate, and I have been traveling for 20yrs!!!>>><<<It‚Äôs a bus.>>><<<Scoot is like wormhole for me. <br>I board, sleep and arrive. Sleeping helps me skip all the bad bits lol.>>><<<Liverpool fan ‚ù§Ô∏è>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wrdaaYBDk&amp;t=282">4:42</a> Can we appreciate that he put a camera inside a trash bin?>>><<<Is scoot airlines still fying in the present times?>>><<<Another reviewer  flew Scoot business class and the food was terrible so you had a lucky escape there, and while he lobed up at business check in so did the economy passengers and thus was allowed. So he got no concessions for flying business class.>>><<<Nicht f√ºr Geld uns gute Worte mit dieser komischen Billig-Airline !!!>>><<<One time in scoot from Singapore to Bangkok they did not mention the flight the &#39;TR&#39; before flight number so we went to immigration and showed our ticket they were not allowing, we stayed and finding the scoot office in the airport, but we did not find it but a nice lady in the airport understood and because of her we called go into Bangkok its was the worst experience ever, this story is not the main Bangkok airport it&#39;s a another airport for low cost airline>>><<<Unethical company and terrible service. They made me pay for everything, they didn&#39;t validate my documents beforehand, and he didn&#39;t let me arbitrarily board my flight.<br>I am a Chilean and Croatian citizen, but I was living in Vietnam for approximately 9 months. I bought a ticket to Greece from Vietnam on Scoot airlines, but they didn&#39;t let me fly since I didn&#39;t have a Croatian passport. Later on the same airline, I wanted to buy a ticket to go to Germany but they did not let me for the same reasons. Finally, without a Croatian passport, I flew through Emirates airlines without problems, since I did have a Croatian citizenship document that Scoot airlines did not accept, despite the fact that the regulations clearly in both mentioned countries said that they accepted the entry of Croatian citizens.<br>They did not validate my documents nor did they bother to find out if the citizen documents would be accepted in the destination country.>>><<<complaining that choosing seat is $11, food is $12 etc‚Ä¶ but do you not realise that singapore airlines etc will charge HUNDREDS more? low cost airlines are giving you the choice to add those things or not rather than being forced to pay more for them!>>><<<There was once I took Scoot from Singapore to Thailand. My family got the seats at the back and we were able to sit all apart to look at the viewüòÇ>>><<<Was told by a local Singaporean recently never to fly Scoot. I believe these locals who have nothing to loose by passing on their knowledge>>><<<That airport is amazing. I&#39;d spend all day there even if I wasn&#39;t flying anywhere.>>><<<Did you notice the Formula 1 things for the Singapore GP where Sebastian Vettel won>>><<<Air Asia is the low cost king üòÑ>>><<<I can buy 9 cup of noodles in the US for the price of 1 on that flight. So just bring your own noodles &amp; a MRE heater bag &amp; your set, LOL.>>><<<Bro Scoot is the best Budget airline I flew that airline every year when we go to Cebu to Singapore then going back>>><<<I flew scootbiz when they were fairly new back in 2012 from Singapore to Gold Coast for SGD 550. The staff were great (and I think wearing the same uniforms) but it was impossible to sleep even with earplugs as everything was so rickety/squeaky. I think it was an ex-SIA A340 or 777. I wouldn&#39;t do it again unless I have no alternatives.>>><<<So I took them once, from Melbourne to Jaipur. Except that a month out from the flight I got an email saying that my ticket was cancelled from Singapore to Jaipur because they no longer were serving that route. the options were a reroute or refund of that leg, which would take 12 weeks i think it was. I&#39;m not sure why airlines take that long to refund your money - possibly they hope you will choose a different option. In the end I just flew to KL from Singapore and took Air Asia to Jaipur. The process of  the reroute took HOURS and HOURS on the phone trying to work it out, and just as long waiting for the call to be answered. <br>I did still fly SCOOT to Singapore though, on the Dreamliner in what they called &#39;Scootbiz&#39; at the time. It was a large seat and meals were included, although I already had paid for the meal. I big $150 to upgrade, which was the lowest they allowed and I was surprised to find I &#39;won&#39; the seat. But I slept and it was comfortable. The cabin crew weren&#39;t that friendly, I remember that. Air Asia, for all its faults, I like in as much as the staff are usually super friendly and welcoming, the same could not be said for SCOOT. I feel like they staffed it by demoting staff who didnt hit KPIs on Singapore Airlines and weren&#39;t happy about it. Great vid as always Josh,.>>><<<At oeats scoot is better than some ungrateful creep. If u are on my flight, and you are tge obly passenger, ill eject myself and leave you to crash to the ground. You deserve it. Idc if hav typo. Read it yourself. Singapore Scoot is better than some traahy american airlines.>>><<<Here&#39;s a soft reminder for Changi Airport Â®ºÂ¶ìÊú∫Âú∫ (no offense this is told by my Singaporean friends)<br>Changi hv swimming pools and there are no security guard at the night time (probably they sneak out). So u might not need to pay for this charged facility and get a shower there>>><<<Quick question - why do you always prefer to sit at the very back?>>><<<singapore to Bali? i think the best is still KLM in terms of price and come with full service..>>><<<Not being able to recline the seat is good as then the person in front can&#39;t recline into you!>>><<<It was like $10US for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice. That is not a bad price AT ALL for a meal in the sky.>>><<<I&#39;ve use scoot and air Asia quite a lot usually because of budget constraints. The staff are pretty good, and they smile a lot too. <br>Actually for food, u can order online when you book the flights, it&#39;s slightly cheaper than when you&#39;re on the flight.>>><<<Ah! Pre COVIDIAN days!<br>Josh: scoot<br>Closed captioning: screwed<br>üòú>>><<<I miss Changi. Hopefully corona soon finish so all airports in the world will be free open soon>>><<<When you bay a seat, you not get a Benz.>>><<<But a budget airline and they buy a 787 dreamliner that doesn&#39;t make sense as it does not matched>>><<<Scoots cheated me. Lied to me. Your staff harassed me!<br>Nisha Sharma, Ms.Emma, then Ms.Nicole Ang,<br> then Ms.Daisy<br><br>@FSsw>>><<<Scoot: We charge S$11 for seat selection.<br>American Airlines: Hold my coffee, we charge $60 or more for seat selection, free seat selection if booking with checked bags.<br><br>Worst part is, SCOOT bans you from bringing your own food. WHAT!?!?>>><<<Singapore is a wonderful place but the Singaporean people don&#39;t take criticism well as they hold a belief that the are superior to Asian nations.>>><<<I flew from Berlin to Singapore on scoot... it was Josh&#39;s experience on steroids. Never gonna try to be cheap again üòÇ>>><<<I flew Scoot in Business class back in 2018. It was an okay flight. Now screen, so I was happy I had my big ipad with me. Tho... When on board, it was really cold, and travelling from one warm country to another, I did not bring a jacket with me into the plane. (From Singapore to Japan) and I was Freezing... So bad for 5 hours. The flight crew could only help me with a cup of warm water which helped a bit, but the plane being icy cold, that was really bad of them not to have blankets... Especially for Business class. The food was averrage, so no complaints. The only think was the heating. Otherwise. Nice crew and really nice view. I don&#39;t hate on them at all. Just think they should have blankets on board for long flights that are over 6 hours. :)>>><<<Lol...I remember falling asleep next to the Scoot checking counter when I was transiting from Changi to Bangkok>>><<<During debarkation  the carpet looked disgusting>>><<<Ive been flying Scoot for about 5 years now (except 2020). I always thought in-flight food and water was more of a priviledge rather than an essential. I frequent the SIN to TSN and back>>><<<How&#39;s Silk Air ???>>><<<Last year i flew to Singapore from Chennai...  Its an average airline though i give 5 üåü  to all the airlines for safe travel>>><<<‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíï>>><<<I took Scoot from Singapore to Taiwan, about 5 hours. The experience was not so bad, at least the seat was quite comfortable, better than other budget flight.<br>So service is good service to me. The air crews leave me alone in the entire journey, proper friendly was not included. How nice!>>><<<Comn>>><<<Scoot is the worst of the lot.. don‚Äôt waste your time and money with them>>><<<Hope you didn&#39;t get a death threat from Scoot for your reviewüòÖ>>><<<Hmmm..... book the cheapest flight and expect first class service. Wake up to the real world.>>><<<If you&#39;ve ever been with scoot, you&#39;ve loved the Singapore Airport because it&#39;s a magical place there>>><<<Did he say low class carrier?>>><<<Man !!love the videos>>><<<I have the same reebok shoes which you are wearing.. üòÜ>>><<<The seats in Scoot...o m g..>>><<<My experience with Scoot:<br>I booked a flight from Clark to Zurich for May 18,2020. This flight got canceled due to Covic-19. I took the voucher since I need to fly to Europe anyway.<br>I try to book the exact same flight for September/October, always get an error that they wont accept the voucher for the flight.<br>It took almost a month until Scoot notified me, that I can not use this voucher (same flight as voucher is originated from) for this flight since it is partly with Singapore Airlines (parent company). This was not announced or in any of Scoot&#39;s rules, when I decided to go for the voucher.<br>My request to then refund the voucher back to my credit card was denied, vouchers can not be refunded and will expire within a year.<br>This is more than cheat on costumers, not talking about customer - company relationship. And this with a parent company Singapore Airlines. Both never ever again.<br>What do you think ?>>><<<Josh please  make a video on silk air....>>><<<We used Scoot to fly from Melbourne to Athens and we had sandwiches, croissants, cakes and many more with us. Also we had 5 bottles of water.<br>Everything in our cabin luggage and no crew member said anything. Also we used out tablet instead the in flight entertainment.<br>We paid $1550 in total for 2 return tickets with 40kg total baggage and 6h stop at Singapore.<br>Second cheapest was Emirates with $1600 each ticket. <br>If anyone want to pay $1600 more just to have meal and tv well....that&#39;s not me.>>><<<Good>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wrdaaYBDk&amp;t=281">4:41</a> why did you throw away ur camera>>><<<Funny indian sitting in front of your seat üòùüòùüòù did you hear him speaking in a funny tone during travel?>>><<<Been flying Scoot for 10 years +...awesome airline.

I am very cautious with budget airlines.  Thank you so much for the video.>>><<<When I asked for water in Scoot in Jan2020, they asked me to buy a water bottle for 2 dollars ü§£ü§£ü§£. <br><br>Although through extreme persuation, they gave me water they use for the noodles and coffee.>>><<<Now you know Singapore suck if they charge low price.

It is basic but the plane is very unlikely to fall for the price you pay.>>><<<Worth it when I paid SGD 580 for Jakarta-Singapore-Berlin return. Also personally I find Scoot‚Äôs food a lot better than many other budget airlines eg. Air Asia, Jetstar so the price is justified.>>><<<Scoot is a much safer airline compared to others in SEA . Would prioritise that over other perks>>><<<Hey josh how much u paid for the flight?>>><<<I am not a fan of Scoot. I don‚Äôt like their policy of outside food is not allowed on flight, plus their food is expensive. Kind of force me spent unreasonable price for the food on flight. Sometimes, the ticket is not the cheap as well. Airasia still offer cheaper ticket most of the time and the food are more affordable. For the seat selection, i think almost all airlines, no matter budget or non-budget, most require you to pay for seat selection. This is budget airline, you can‚Äôt blame them for this.>>><<<What A dreamliner>>><<<I always fly with scoot when i had a chance for holiday trip,  yess they are cheap airline but i rather choose scoot than cebupac airline, scoot is more better they are on time than cebupac airline cheap but always delay,>>><<<i dont understand, scoot is great>>><<<Air Asia is superior and normally cheaper. Great meals at a reasonable price. KL is also a cheaper, nicer, city to sightsee in.>>><<<I totally agreed as this airline is totally overprice. Unless you have no other choice, don‚Äôt choose this airline.>>><<<Airasia is better>>><<<Damn i thought that the Scoot logo in the thumbnail is an egg>>><<<Only time I would fly with Scoot or budget airlines is to go to nearby countries like Bangkok, Malaysia and others. . . . .Singaporean here>>><<<Hey fly scoot is not worst>>><<<The food price is higher than AirAsia>>><<<Trust me I prefer scoot than Turkish Airlines<br>First of all scoot has bigger seats<br>Even though Turkish has tvs they are HORRIBLE<br>Scoot actually has good, edible food<br>Scoot‚Äôs much cheaper<br>Turkish Airline‚Äôs seats are sooo tight<br>And they are so uncomfortable <br><br>The end>>><<<Scoot Hnl to Changing was disgusting. Seats stained and uncleaned. Toilet had dirty, wet floor, no toilet paper or paper towels.  Had to pay for ANY checked baggage. Seats very cramped. Had to pay for a blanket or pillow.

I must add flight attendants very nice.>>><<<2 hrs 45 mins ? head rest looks v comfy .. fare is the ? .. thanks for vlog>>><<<It&#39;s a budget low cost airlines. Don&#39;t compare to full fare airlines. Please be fair in your review.>>><<<Mate, you are the only youtuber that only seems to have negative experiences.  You expect 5 star singapore airlines style service on their budget carrier.  Scoot is cheap for a reason and $11 for seat selection is very reasonable for a LCC.>>><<<I probably fly as much as you but my experiences seem totally different. I see more negatives from your videos than any other airline commentator. High standards or an entitled view of the world? If I was an airline I would be a bit nervous if I knew you were flying with us - think I would rather have One World Flyer or Dennis Bunnick on board. Living in Australia I fly Scoot quite a lot to pick up European flights in Asia. In my experience they are cheaper, more comfortable and definitely more reliable than either Air Asia or Jetstar. Food is not as good as Air Asia but as good as Jetstar. So they are my preferred budget airline for my 7/9 hour trips.

Then they lost my luggage, took 6 days to get it back to me. Never again.>>><<<Singapore&#39;s not a good airport to spend the night.. not enough comfy spaces to sleep..>>><<<As much as I love my country and Singapore Airlines I will never ever fly scoot becos as u clearly seen for yourself unless I have no choice ...it&#39;s the worst of any lcc I have seen...the 787 is just that a 787 with nothing  and service is no where to be seen. The food is exp and horrible and scoot stands for sure cannot operate on time haha...it&#39;s a disgrace to our national carrier the parent company..I understand it&#39;s  lcc but airasia and jetstar just to name 2 are so much better and as I always tell my friends...do your homework ..plan ahead and many times I get great value on legendary carriers such as EVA as TG etc. There&#39;s no need to fly anywhere above 2 hrs in scoot..it&#39;s a disgrace!>>><<<The title &quot;worst&quot; is rather misleading. I have flown on Scoot numerous times between Singapore and various Australian cities. For the price, it&#39;s quite hard to beat. Have flown Singapore to Sydney return for &lt; S$300 (Fly only.

The food on AirAsia is fantastic and they really paid attention to the quality, Nasi Lemak, Nasi Briyani, even their snacks like curry puffs, are simply delicious....and they are cheap when u get them online during your booking. Even shopping for items are great, got myself an RFID compact card/cash holder on one of their flights for a reasonable price. The flight timings are also quite decent although I do remember those early days when they first started, flying times were really awful like way too late at night or too early in the morning. Now, since the fleet has expanded tremendously, they do have a better selection of flight times. For long hauls, they even offer flat beds. Great huh>>><<<Air Asia is still the best LCC in Asia...AA food is delicious and unbeatable.>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot once, though in their &quot;ScootBiz&quot; cabin - seat was good for the price, but the meal (included, and the same as is offered for sale in the rest of the plane) was borderline inedible - I wouldn&#39;t pay for one if it was an option.>>><<<Flying from SIN to Bali, use Garuda or KLM.

I see sooo many horror reviews of Scoot :D>>><<<Try Wizz Air and after that you will absolutely LOVE Scoot!! 6 hrs from Astana (Nur Sultan) to Budapest on Wizz was an absolute pain.>>><<<I think you shouldnt be an Airline reviewer.  Scoot is one of the best if not the best LCC. You are comparing Apples with oranges. Its an LCC for goodness sake lol - you ask for much when what you pay for your ticket is peanuts. You might as well also add that business class of an FSC is way better than Scoot lol. <br><br>What you should actually focus on is the Value for money. Is it worth saving that money to fly on an LCC rather than in economy class of a FSC?>>><<<Their bulky back of seat intimidating next seat. Uncomfort.>>><<<Why not let your viewers on your blogs know what you&#39;re paid for that ticket, whether it was free, discounted or normal fee (economy, premium economy, business and first class on your reviews) <br>That may assist with people&#39;s choices when flying ‚úàÔ∏è>>><<<All seats at the rear bulkhead can&#39;t recline.

Air Asia is the total package. Great crews, great fares, vegetarian food that puts some mainline carriers like SQ to shame. Not targetting Singapore Airlines but when booking their flights to Athens, Berlin et al BEWARE! These SQ flights are operated by Scoot. Bad form esp. if paying SQ fare. Qantas does the same opaque marketing of flights, meaning you could end up on Jetstar. A case of once bitten, twice shy.>>><<<In Paul Lucas&#39; review he mentions that not only is food expensive onboard, they ban you from bringing your own food and drink on board. Is that still true? That&#39;d be a deal breaker for me, LCC or not LCC.>>><<<If u travel with friends or family on scoot. Actually dont have to pay $11 for the seats. It will be automatically assigned together as long as all of them are checked in together. It happens to me quite a number of times! üôÜ>>><<<What I don`t agree with is ? You book a flight aircraft get`s delay 24 hours yet they paying for your Motel or Hotel even know you only pay for your seat on a aircraft.¬† If you get a bus it gets delay 24 hours they wont put you up in motel hotel they laugh at you. Why is people book a flight it gets delay and expect motels hotel even know your paying for a aircraft seat ?>>><<<Yeah low cost but if you add the extras nothing special>>><<<Airasia the best among other<br>Low cost.. you may review Citilink.. good feedback about them>>><<<Scoot.....in my taste...

Or is that a different airline?>>><<<I flu scoot from bali to singapore business class. Its not that bad, i mean its worst compare to full service airlines like emirates but at least their safety has good standard of developed nation airlines.. the service just like any order budget airlines like air asia.>>><<<You should be careful about what you say. I have travelled with Scoot as well and it is a good airline. You said that the seats were comfortable and the crew was good. You have great expectations from a budget airline. Need some extra comfort kindly pay for it.>>><<<So funny I got a sccot add wile watching>>><<<your amount on ads in videos are just sad, not good product ...>>><<<Well done Josh, so brown bag food to save money>>><<<YNWA üôåüèΩ>>><<<Oh my gosh!

Of course, as LLC, I do tone down my ego/expectation.>>><<<They are not even cheap but forbid to bring food>>><<<Flew them last year from SIN-KLU and back...felt cramped but flights were on time, good slots and for less than 1h absolutely acceptable...would fly them again>>><<<i had flown with scoot 2 times..scoot was the worst airlines i have  ever experienced..i wont fly with it ever again!!!!>>><<<Josh..

Scoot is not cheap nowadays for their short haul flight, Jetstar Asia is a lot more attractively priced. But there are always some bargains such as the direct flights to Osaka and Australia.>>><<<i agree with this. Airasia X sell a set of meal+water for RM15. however Scoot sell a set of meal for $17 (that is around RM51 üòÇüòÇüòÇ) . have been flown with them long haul Athens to Singapore. Halal meal is limited (or maybe non). so put aside Scoot and choose premium airlines.>>><<<Air Asia:<br><br>Everything is amazing except for the seat and legroom.<br><br><br>Scoot:<br><br>Absolutely everything is dog shit.>>><<<India has biggest and cheapest mobile data network in the world.>>><<<Fly ti Bali from Singapore with Air Asia,  they operate direct flight from Singapore also.

I found the airline excellent value.I paid for emergency exit and board me first, a very low premium. I did not order food eating a delicious meal in the amazing Singapore airport. I have travelled to 115 countries, and fly constantly, carry on only. Pay for the low cost seat upgrades at booking. No complaints, modern plane, lots of room. Good value.>>><<<You could&#39;ve found the day beds in T3 that are free to use...>>><<<@JoshCahill You said that there was no recline but some of the footage showed your seat reclined>>><<<NOK Air is the best low cost carrier I have used. Baggage is cheap as are flight cost.>>><<<Great content Josh.>>><<<You have to know how low cost carriers work before you take it. If you want to fly tomorrow and buy your ticket today, you pay top fare. if you travel with another friend and you book on the same reference, the chances of sitting together is very high. Prebook your meal, you get certain discount. Prebook your baggage, it will be cheaper then buying it on check-in.  Entertainment??, bring your own laptop.>>><<<Hi Josh. You might want to try Citilink Indonesia. The growing lcc of Garuda Indonesia. They would be a better option than scoot i guess>>><<<Allez Allez Allez <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ynwa">#YNWA</a>... excellent  review Josh!>>><<<Review doesnt start until 6 minutes into the video>>><<<I did try Scoot once from Hong Kong to Singapore with the Dreamliner, very early morning flight at 7am. I feel that the crews were so far nice, seat was comfy! (Your experience gives me a feel that Scoot ~ Ryanair...haha)<br><br>The low cost king in Asia? of course AirAsia! For Europe, I prefer Ryanair (favourite)!!>>><<<Thank you josh wanted to really know about it>>><<<Who is the worst passenger in the history of your channel, SpiceJet ,Nepal air,or Egypt airline lady>>><<<Hi Josh<br>I live in R.P as an expat and fly to Perth,  Australia normally twice a year. As I fund all my own travels i mostly use LCC as there are so many choices. If I was to choose the most reliable LCC i&#39;d likely say Air Asia. I&#39;ve had the least delays and never yet had a flight schedule change. I use 5J alot as I&#39;m a sucker for cheaper prices but i must say they are the most unreliable LCC. Consistently changes to schedules and always delaying flights. I can&#39;t recall the last time i was not delayed. In saying that they have provided me very cheap fares given you book ahead of time and with there famous 1 piso fare promotion. I used them recently to Guam,  similar flight time between SIN and MNL for $75USD roundtrip. That is an absolute bargain. Jetstar Asia i find decent but once again I dont use them as much as I once did since they no longer operate SIN-PER. Like Cebu Pacific, Jetstar Asia have a tendency to reschedule flights which is a hassle. As in customer service and on time departures 3K are sound. Finally Scoot, I have had my fair share of schedule changes with them and you make an excellent point, their flight timings are always early morning or late night which makes connections often prolonged.  Singapore Changi I agree is an excellent airport to be stuck at. On my last long lay over i walked the entire T3 to T1 to T2 airside and noted the best sleeping areas for future trips. As long as you have a pillow Changi provide some decent seats and benches for resting. One last mention on Scoot, In January of 2018 my flight was retimed out of PER meaning my 2 hr connection in SIN was cut. My original connection was a red eye leaving Singapore about 1am. The next available flight was not until around 4pm. I know for a fact that the majority of LCC would simply rebook you on the next flight without much in terms of compensation. Scoot was very generous and I had a free stay at the Crowne Plaza T1 with buffet meals included. I was very surprised they were so generous. To sum it up,  you simply get what you pay for. Personally flying sectors of 5 hrs or less I can&#39;t justify the full service costs. SQ is my favourite carrier but still the 5 hr rule applies. Exception: Expiring SQ Krisflyer miles which I&#39;ll consume. Safe travels to all. Michael>>><<<11$ that&#39;s pretty cheap if we compare to Canadian airlines>>><<<Is it the airline that doesn‚Äôt allow you to bring your own food or drink on board?

Thank you.>>><<<Congrats on the 199k.>>><<<Hey Josh, YNWA!>>><<<Try Jetstar>>><<<So called low cost airlines r actually not very low, ticket is little Cheaper but the Stress they give is huge.>>><<<Hey Josh.   Great video but here is my take on a couple of things.  1.Scoot is a budget brand of Singapore Airlines and I feel that they are just using Singapore Airlines brand to charge at a higher price. <br>2. As a proud Singaporean myself, $15 for food on a plane is not steep but a total rip off.<br>3. U are quite lucky that the plane landed early as i have never had a great experience.  4/5 times they had delays.<br>4. The service from the crew also feels like a crew that is higher on budget.  <br>5.  Lastly ur question on who is the king of budget airline.  I would say Air Asia is still the best hands down.  From the ground crew all the way to the flight crew service, cost, flight timings, no issues at all.   Sorry for taking up too much of ur time to but in my thoughts but once again, thanks for the great video>>><<<Rating cleaners is so nice!

Worst thing yet to come -- the terminal CLOSED (never knew such a thing exists) at night and so I was awake the whole night near the car parking basement. <br><br>You&#39;re definitely lucky to be waiting at Changi Airport! :)>>><<<Liverpool yakü§ßü§ßü§¢ü§ï>>><<<Your very own version of ‚ÄúThe Terminal‚Äù üòÖ>>><<<Loved the video, only complaint is that you support Liverpool not a big fan of that part üò≠üò≠>>><<<Looks like every airport turned into a home for yaüòÇüëçüèª>>><<<I would prefer easyjet than Scoot<br>Anyway another good vid Josh:)>>><<<My back would be killing me after a flight with a no recline seat!

I&#39;d woken up early in the morning, gone to the airport, waited all the way until boarding and it was then that someone from Scoot held an ipad walking around to inform us that the flight departure had been delayed by over 12 hours due to a typhoon. My cousin was informed by SQ of this delay the night before and stayed comfortably at home until the subsequent night departure. This blew my mind considering that SQ fully owns Scoot.>>><<<airasia the best budget flight in the world>>><<<Please review thai airways.. I am waiting for your review, then I will book my tickets on it.

For Jetstar and Air Asia, you can&#39;t choose your seats either. If you want you get a window/aisle seat, you can go to the desk and ask them if you can have that seat. Or when you board the airplane, just let the attendant know. If there is any available, they will definitely swap for you.<br>Meals wise, the price is pretty much the same as Jetstar and Air Asia. But their food, to be honest, taste great :)<br>Their seats are actually more spacious and comfortable compared to Air Asia, in my opinion.I love their friendly staffs too!  However, you are right that the price of the flight is not cheap. It&#39;s at least 50sgd more than Jetstar/Air Asia.<br>I used to fly scoot a lot, but changed to other airlines instead, because I don&#39;t think I am willing to pay the extra 50bucks just for a little more comfort. Moreover, sometimes the international airlines (Eg. Cathay/MH/SQ) have the similar prices for the same routes, so I take them instead>>><<<I WAS JUST THERE>>><<<Love from bangladeshüáßüá©>>><<<AirAsia X the best LCC>>><<<Mostly always fly the low cost carriers off this little rock that is Jersey. Not that there is much choice to be fair. I do swap between Easyjet and Flybe and have never found an issue with either. Yes the extra for luggage ect but they are normally far cheaper than BA. Not always, have scored cheaper flight with BA, but to be fair, now they are not a full service airline in Economy on short haul, there is no difference between them. But it&#39;s hard to fight the low cost airlines, i&#39;m flying from Jersey to Edinburgh to see family for Christmas for ¬£9.99 each way including carry-on.  You can&#39;t really complain about anything for that price. Choosing a seat for a 2hour flight is not an issue either. <br>Will be interesting to see how Flybe evolve now they have been bought over by Virgin.>>><<<Josh: If you flight Scoot, you either try to save a lot of money or there&#39;s no other choice<br><b>Lion Air: hold my beer</b>>>><<<My concern with Scoot isn&#39;t so much that you have to pay for things but that the condition of the cabin is just poor. In the few times I&#39;ve flown them, their seats were dirty and there was trash in the pockets. I&#39;m not expecting the plane to be completely dirt free but it was just horrendous.>>><<<Doesn&#39;t Scoot also not allow for customers to bring their own food on board?  Unless they changed their policy.>>><<<A young member of our family travelled with an infant from Perth to Sydney with Tigerair Australia, the LCC of Virgin, then Sydney to Singapore with Scoot.  The Tigerair plane was small and cramped but the cabin crew were very kind and helpful with the little one.  On Scoot, the opposite.  Excellent plane but the cabin crew were absolutely unhelpful.  The little fellow was crying and she was getting blamed, she eventually fled with him to the toilet and sat there with him until he went to sleep then returned to her seat and held him, asleep, all the way to Singapore.  Scoot is a technically competent airline, safe and reliable but for international LCC travel from Australia my choice would be Jetstar or Air Asia.  And on both of these airlines if you pre-pay luggage and a meal you get almost what you get on a full service airline.>>><<<YNWA Josh‚ù§Ô∏è>>><<<Me: Tries to skip Cahills advert <br><br><br><br>YouTube: Gives me and advert <br><br><br><br>YouTube: my powers have doubled since the last time we fought>>><<<3 years ago QF reintroduced  Perth to Singapore flights after a short absence,  that was great but the downside was that they stuck a 737 on the route.  So for me it was 5 hrs stuck in a QF 737 , full service yes but definitely not international quality vs Scoot 787.   I actually preferred Scoot!!   Anyway QF have come to their senses and they now use A330&#39;s>>><<<I actually flew Scoot for Berlin to Singapore and didnt see that you cant bring your own food on this long trip. So whils I was eating my sandwich that I boughr, the FA strongly warned me to eat it fast and what I did was wrong, embarassing me among my felllow passengers.

I avoid Scoot.  I even booked a Thai Airways to BKK and then onto SIN on SQ.  Avoid Scoot if you can.>>><<<Some people say that Asian low cost airlines are better than European and American low cost ones>>><<<Josh, Tiger merged with Scoot in 2017, so they&#39;re really no alternative.<br>What your review ignored is that there are two groups of people when it comes to LCC: Those that book checked luggage, food &amp; seat assignment at time of booking and those that will simply do without these services; basically next to nobody pays them those prices listed in the menu. Scoot days bringing your own food is forbidden but with so few staff that seems rather difficult to enforce.<br><br>Fun fact #1: Even if you book in what they refer to as &quot;Business class&quot; on their long-haul overnight trips to/from Athens or Berlin - I believe Premium Economy is more accurate for what you get - you will still have to pay if you want a pillow or blanket!<br><br>Fun fact #2: There was the case of a German NGO guy who saw those food prices after having booked a ticket and contacted Scoot and told them he would go on a hunger strike in protest. He then had to take the threat back (I believe Scoot told him they wouldn&#39;t honor the ticket if he carried out the threat) but come day of the trip, what did he do? Just had water, which was seen as the same thing. End of story: He&#39;s found himself blacklisted for life from Scoot/Tiger (if you go on their website the list something like 25 reasons that will get you banned - and making threats, even this type, which is mostly harming yourself - is one of them).>>><<<I was driving from Germany to The Netherlands when I saw you uploading the video.

In comparison to Air Asia X, they have better seats and I had really good sleep as it was an overnight flight on a 7-8 hours flight, and the food wasn‚Äôt bad at all. However, I still feel that Air Asia X have better service and the price you pay is still worth it, though the seats are a bit cramped. I would go for Air Asia for the price but would still fly Scoot if there are no better in terms of the cost.>>><<<They charge $5 for a glass of water !>>><<<Great video josh>>><<<Low cost king for me is Indigo and AirAsia. Josh you will agree for sure. For Indigo, it is mostly on time. Flew them from Chennai to Spore. Quite good. Service is consistent. Timing is better than AirAsia. For AirAsia, service is okay and food is damn good however the full price including the add ons can be expensive for my case.>>><<<Huge fun>>><<<Wow Josh your video clips are really amazing!

They‚Äôre better than you think.>>><<<I would say it&#39;s Air Asia! The best!. Haven&#39;t flown with scoot but I guess they are like SpiceJet of India!>>><<<I&#39;ve flown scoot a few times, from Aus to SIN and v.v. at the right price they are fantastic (I&#39;m talking $150 AUD one way) once the fares move into the 250-400+ range one way the value quickly decreases. One other positive is they ans AirAsia are pretty good for last minute fares compared to a full service last minute.>>><<<I would&#39;nt touch Scoot if it was free.>>><<<Scoot is just to much, I once flew them from Bangkok to Taipei and they did not even serve free glass of water. That‚Äôs something which pissed me and there prices are not so cheap compared to other full service carriers on the same route overall not gonna fly Scoot.>>><<<Good>>><<<I would never fly them>>><<<i think the flight was quite alright. the only issue was the boarding process>>><<<Josh, I like that you fly all the different classes on the airlines and aren&#39;t afraid to admit when you have a positive experience in economy or a negative experience in business or first class.  It gives me a much better picture of what different airlines are like.<br>I suffer from spinal spondylosis and am confined to a wheelchair.  I recently had a heart attack, but doctors tell me I may return to the air in the spring.  Japan and Singapore are on my bucket list of places to visit(my dad is retired Navy, and he especially loved Singapore; he tells me it&#39;s so beautiful there).  Would you be able to recommend any airlines that are kind to the physically handicapped?  I belong to Delta&#39;s Sky Rewards, so I tend to be partial to someone who partners with Delta, as Delta takes very good care of me.  Don&#39;t know if that makes a difference or not.  Your wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

I can&#39;t help thinking of people doing rock/paper /scissors, for a seat swap!!..... Hahahahaha!!....... üëç.>>><<<Im very confused as to why you are bitching about a LOW COST carrier? The main premise of scoot is to get you from point A to B. Thats it. You decide if you want anything else as YOU decided to fly a low cost airline. Of course all the extras are way overpriced as thats how they make money. If you want food, drinks and entertainment fly a main airline. Simple. Completely unnecessary video.>>><<<I&#39;d rather fly Air Koryo in an old Soviet jet that&#39;s not far from dropping out of the sky than fly Scoot ...

There is barely a $30 difference in a flight I&#39;m pricing from Phuket to Bali on the same day in the morning between these two carriers. The only difference is the Singapore Airlines price upfront is the total cost and the Scoot initial price is a low cost teaser fare, that is never the final price.>>><<<Did the booking page say it wasa Pok√©mon livery plane or cookie box üç™>>><<<It&#39;s pretty silly to review a budget airline flight.

I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.<br><br>In summary, AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.>>><<<I‚Äôve taken Scoot, both regional and long haul.  Regional is to Penang and Bangkok, and that‚Äôs about the limit of my endurance for a 28‚Äù seat pitch.  If we‚Äôre checking in luggage, a mainline flight is preferable (Sing or Thai, if it‚Äôs to Bangkok).  Because with the luggage fees added in, it‚Äôs often really close in price.  On long-haul, it was Narita to Bangkok (Don Meuang at the time) and we did Scoot business.  Far more comfortable and it included a meal and something to drink.  The seat was more like a mainline premium economy seat than a true business class seat, but as it was a daytime flight, that was fine.  We‚Äôll be doing Scoot Biz from Narita to Sing in November.  The flight was significantly lower in price than any mainline airline.<br><br>It‚Äôs an LCC, so I set my expectations accordingly.  Are they great?  No.  But they (generally) get me to where I‚Äôm going with a minimum of inconvience.>>><<<I&#39;m considering Scoot to fly MEL-SIN in October.

Staff are not allowed to interact with passengers in this manner on the airside for security purposes.>>><<<Great video, Jayden!  Boy, that didn‚Äôt look like a great value. The meal you ordered looked pretty terrible and I can‚Äôt believe they charge to use the power socket. Also, the legroom on the second flight was terrible. I‚Äôve heard you also can‚Äôt bring your own food onboard. Is that true?  I can see why you‚Äôd want to avoid them in the future.>>><<<Jayden live in Tuen Munüò≥I thought u just drive your car when u go outüòØ>>><<<T3 because Scoot is a Singapore Airlines subsidiary?>>><<<Scoot is a low cost airline, subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. For a low cost airline, I find the service pretty good. Sometimes, the crew will also host fun activities on board the longer flights (such as Guess the Country Flag on a flight from SIN - KIX) to entertain the passengers on board. For the price of food, it is towards the expensive side (S$4 for a canned drink in Singapore will cost at most S$2 instead). So it makes more sense to fly Scoot to a regional destination as it is more ÂàíÁÆó compared to flying SQ.>>><<<What a girly voice>>><<<üõ´üèÉüõ´üèÉüõ´üòÇü§§ü§§üôå‚ù§üíû‚ù§üíã>>><<<Hi Jayden üòâ. In my opinion, Scoots inflight pricing is a little overpriced (dont know if they have made price changes since) compared to its competition, Jet Star Asia, also based in SG(not the OZ based Jetstar... of course u knew that its different)... between Scoot and the previous Tiger Air .... id still prefer Tiger for in flight pricing) Other than that, the idea of Scoot is good . So Jetstar Asia is my go to when fliying from SG to Iindonesia(in my case)... Also, Scoot have funny rules like not being able to bring outside snacks.. ü§î Dont know if they tweak that since.>>><<<Good share‚ù§>>><<<How much did they charge to use the rest room? ü§î>>><<<If I booked on Singapore and got Scoot I&#39;d be pissed>>><<<I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s appropriate to request a specific flight ü§£but could you please do a review on Qantas A330 Sydney -&gt; Haneda.

Your reviews are always so informative and helpful.<br>Honestly, as a Singaporean, having the same sentiment as u, if I can fly by other airlines, I will. If I have to take Scoot, the flight will not be more than 2 hours for me or no other choice (which I really doubt).<br>Scoot&#39;s standard has dropped quite drastically ever since they &#39;merged&#39; with Tiger Airways and has been dropping.>>><<<nice -trip report :) :) cant wait to back in HK after 3 year of covid in December :)>>><<<Thanks for another report.

I&#39;m certain they stuffed our meals up...$53 AUD for 2 rolls w drink and small chicken meal...The flight attendant wasn&#39;t going to budge when I questioned I&#39;m sure there more.... Return home last Thursday we took our own snacks, as did quite a few others on all flights üòÄ...Not sure if we&#39;ll use them next time, probably Vietjet direct Brisbane to Saigon or Singapore Airlines....Have also flown Air Asia X 5 times and their meals are way better for similar price ü§ô‚úàÔ∏èüåÖ‚ú®üê¨>>><<<In my opinion, as a Hongkonger, the new territories light rail is pretty underrated and not as well known, partly because it is situated far away from the city centre.<br>I find them pretty convenient to travel on between places in that area :)>>><<<I terracing that u dared fly scoot Jayden üòÇ<br>Oh god u used an unfriendly skies pillow üôÄ<br>You should have eaten at hungry jack‚Äôs>>><<<what time can you speak Chinese>>><<<Scoot is a great airline with great staff but the food has always been very ordinary.

You are a hero Didi for taking this long flight but hey as you said good value. I reckon it will be less painful since I am a shorty at 1.7m... food u are right the worst food when compared to other lcc. But the wink from the ground crew was on point üòä... What happened to your hair üòÇ and I love that watch .. always seen in your videos! Wonder where you got it from?... Def the a321neo would be ok for a short flight to Penang and I love the cute character on the winglet! No power supply yes it&#39;s a bumper.. why pay for power.. it&#39;s nuts!

Congrats on surviving xD When I flew them from Honolulu to Osaka they were very insistant on no outside food and drink to force you to buy their gruel... I just slept instead haha.

Nice to see your bright smile and bubbly personality coming through, they add excitement to every video. Scoot is a great deal on price, but oh, that awful-looking minestrone...wouldn&#39;t have bothered, better to bring your own food. I read somewhere - &quot;Anyone who says they&#39;ve never paid for air, never bought a bag of potato chips.&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£ It&#39;s always true there&#39;s more air than chips in those bags. You should try to make a point of visiting the US just to fly our low-cost carriers, ex: Spirit and Southwest, to see how they compare. I fly Southwest often, but compared to Scoot, it&#39;s really not low cost. I hear Spirit is &quot;build-your-own&quot; ticket, but I don&#39;t need to save money that badly. Thanks for a great video!>>><<<Well well.<br>Kimchi cup üçú noodles.  Wonder what that smells like, lol.

I&#39;d rather they chill until you actually need something instead of constantly walking around doing nothing.>>><<<Never fly with these dodgy grubs>>><<<This airline is an absolute scammer, crap food, low service, no responsibility for damaged belongings as they crushed our pram during our flight from Phuket to Sydney and took no responsibility blaming us for not purchasing insurance, you pay less and end up paying more than a standard flight in the end, unprofessional and dodgy as fark>>><<<This are the business class seats from the 1990th üòä Had the pleasure to fly this seats on LH to Buenos Aires, Hongkong, Sao Paulo and Tokio ‚Ä¶.

The seats are already uncomfortable enough and this isnt just a 2h flight most of the time. Scoot also flies Athens to Singapore for example and thats like a 10+h flight. That would be an unbearable experience for all involved including the large gentleman/lady>>><<<They lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate. I curse them immidiate bankrupt>>><<<I looked at the prices for this scoot business class Manila to Bangkok. Against Philippines airlines business class. And the Philippines airlines  was a far better price and the business class is a real business class prices for this coming November  Philippines 58000 + pesos scoot 70000 + pesos. No brainier.>>><<<Isn‚Äôt the great legroom in bulkhead available only in the middle row in Scoot Plus?  And only on some of the 787-8? I noticed that you can‚Äôt stretch in bulkhead if you are in AB or HK..>>><<<It‚Äôs ECONOMY PLUS lol not business>>><<<I don‚Äôt know about you guys but everytime I fly scoot, it‚Äôs not bad at all. Just the delay times üòÖ but I always got insurance for it :)>>><<<Was your tummy okay, Joshie? ‚ù§>>><<<I had a misconnection with Singapore Airlines&#39; budget carrier Scoot last month due to delay. No big deal. But when I asked for a confirmation letter from Scoot for my insurance claim, they refused to give it even when the governing laws (I&#39;m flying from Malaysia) by the Malaysian government that they are legally required to provide letter within 7 days if the flight delayed more than 30 minutes. My flight that caused the misconnection was delayed for 2 hours. Until now, they still refuse to provide me with the misconnection letter. God, just a confirmation letter for misconnection, there&#39;s no monetary liability for them, yet they refuse to provide. Don&#39;t fly Scoot, or even Singapore Airlines, period.>>><<<There is no screen with video or entertainment ??>>><<<Koper saya ilang naik.scoot 5 bulan lalu sampai sekarang ga ada kabar.ditelpon diemail, ga.dijawab. sy udah masukin ke media konsumen dan laporkan kemenhub karena scoot sepertinyalepas tangan>>><<<Very strong contrast between TR &amp; SQ in the same family. üòë>>><<<No sound in most parts just small voice over clips here and there>>><<<Crew chillin around on a nearly empty flight.

Will never fly with Scootüò° forever. üëé>>><<<If his is a mushroom... yeah i want it>>><<<Just took a SQ economy flight to Hong Kong and returned on a codeshare Scoot flight. The crew on SQ are always attentive regardless of the class I&#39;m flying, whereas the crew on my Scoot flight was just doing their job. Didn&#39;t even get a smile or goodbye on my way out. Guess you get what you pay for.>>><<<I can&#39;t be the only one who fast forwards to check out the meal..>>><<<I just flew Sydney to Singapore to berlin via scoot economy. Worst flight. Super uncomfortable, no water even in economy, a lot of people including myself didn&#39;t know you needed to bring your own food and drinks  then when going through the boarding gate security in Singapore the water and food I brought along was confiscated. So I had a 14 hour flight with out and water or food.>>><<<I thinl thats fair for obese peiple to have to but two tickets>>><<<not many people really review this airline, just SQ. interesting to view haha>>><<<In my opinion, it still worth to fly this budget airline with B787. Why ? As long as WiFi services provide in the flight, I still can enjoy entertainment from my iPad like general commercial carrier does. I may not put high expectations on food since it is budget airline , but I rather recommend them distribute fast food instead local budget food store. üôÇ <br>Many of you know, B787 is the most modern and safe aircraft in the world. It can get rid off unpredictable turbulence event happen during journey, the wing flow can swing like a bird compare to other aircraft give constant momentum of air flow can help airline company save money on fuel consumption.  Of course, you still can enjoy business class or first class on the commercial carrier if you have enough money to do so. It just an option for those people wish to take budget airline for their travel when they have budget constraints.>>><<<pair of spoilt pansy&#39;s got it. flights empty>>><<<i recently flew gatwick to bangkok with scoot in economy.. and can best describe it as a discomfort endurance test, the crew were ok but 12 hrs is a long flight especially when you&#39;re sat waiting to take off and you&#39;re delayed by an hr and a half! no food or even drinking water, no power outlets, no entertainment.. nothing unless you pay extra! fortunately i came prepared but being a first time scoot flyer i don&#39;t think i will use them again, and as this vid has shown.. business class isn&#39;t much better!>>><<<This review helped me so much! As a ,&quot;fat&quot; person I would rather pay ¬£1000 on a luxury liner then buy 2 seats! You want us to buy extra seats but your bathroom won&#39;t accommodate us. Thanks again for the review>>><<<That VPN route to better pricing sure as heck didn&#39;t work for me  one way Singapore to Sydney and I was using a Singapore server. Not guaranteed I guess.<br>Did you notice a little button for calling an attendant ? A meal was included and they delivered it. Continual fawning was not included.>>><<<Thanks for the video!  I suspect that you dislike the fragrance of the Chinese shiitake mushrooms. It is probably an acquired taste for you since I don&#39;t find it in western cuisine, but it is common in Singapore :) Even as a Singaporean, I dislike it when i was younger, so I could totally relate to you when you said it doesn&#39;t taste like mushrooms but &quot;something&quot; else. Usually, we will eat that dish with dark soya sauce and small chilies, seems like it was not provided though. Cheers>>><<<I don&#39;t know how but my earphones got Better after ending this video>>><<<How could they put these shitty seats in a brand new 787, when Air Asia has had lie flat beds for years now?>>><<<Ad after ad>>><<<Josh you are too funny>>><<<I flew scoot business a few years ago.

I have flown Scoot but in their early days with hand-me-down 777s from SQ.  Their service was reasonably good and the crew were attentive.>>><<<As a travel agent, when they first stepped into the European market, I was at their promotion stand on the ITB))(the big international travel and tourism fair in Berlin). They guy handed us pamphlets and we talked about what we as agents and our customers expect of an airline and they failed in almost every discussion point. At one point even the brand representative laughed with us. What a weird airline, I actually didn&#39;t think they would stay longer than this weird air France? Hipster youth airline. But hey, here we are today.

Related to singapore is free...>>><<<We flew ScootBiz back in October 2017 Melbourne-Singapore and back, the flight to Singapore was ok, no priority boarding in Melbourne although it said it was included, on board they got the already ordered food wrong, staff were older and very helpful, also on the way back , no priority boarding, long lines at the gate,  had a younger group of hostesses ,and they were hopeless, not only wrong sort of food , (we had already booked and paid for) but we both received an ice-cream instead of a meal to start with!  no apology  when asked why, and where were our ordered meals, staff never came around to check on us, we had 1A &amp; 1B . We decided that the fares were not as cheap as they think they are, and to fly Singapore  next time and pay more for what we want(in Business class), sadly we don&#39;t look like getting back to Singapore anytime soon(we are locked down again in Melbourne Australia)  Philltheflyer>>><<<I‚Äôve flown Scoot several times in both classes on busy &amp; less than at times busy sectors. The crew are never overly attentive or engaging. They always rush even on a couple of occasions running through the passenger cabin without any valid reasons. Certainly a stark contrast to SQ, as you well know.>>><<<I think you should try out wow air. Not sure if they still fly but if they do you should review them>>><<<Never again on scoot ‚Ä¶ stewardess more like salesmen , trying to sell u water ‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt find my business reservation put in economy , refused to refund the difference , couldn‚Äôt then even find my booking ,had to go to intermetary to get refunded , luckily I had my receipt to show the mediation . When it goes wrong their mistake , they won‚Äôt help you . Likewise they overbook their flights and close tge checkin early leaving you stranded despite being in the queue they claim yiu don‚Äôt checkin on time ‚Ä¶. Yeah no need to buy trouble from this airline ‚Ä¶.>>><<<Have watched many of your videos &amp; you always seem to dred having someone sitting next to you without some kind of divider.  Even on short flights.<br>You have no problem engaging the crews but almost seem phobic about someone being near you on a passenger aircraft of all things.>>><<<Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end.

No it‚Äôs not on a Dreamliner BUT having lounge access, priority boarding, a delicious meal, attentive cabin crew far outweighs flying on a Dreamliner for me.  üòâ>>><<<IMHO, extra wide passengers should be required to purchase two seats. No one in their right mind wants to have someone‚Äôs fat encroaching their personal space.  ü§®>>><<<Discrimination laws aside, as a long-haul flight attendant (last century) I have witnessed too many folk having their flights/holidays ruined by an obese person trying to fit into a regular Y/C seat &amp; &#39;overflowing&#39; onto their seat neighbours. I agree that they need to purchase 2 seats or travel in a premium class for their own comfort &amp; consideration of others. The safety factor also needs to be considered, obese folk are more difficult to evacuate in the event of emergency especially if they have requested an emergency row seat for the extra room (which they are usually denied anyway). I don&#39;t wish to sound discriminatory but it is what it is...>>><<<Were you flying private 787? Why I saw no other passengers.>>><<<Please check Bulgaria Air, it&#39;s so bad quality for much money! Greetings from Bulgaria! :)>>><<<That might be your best flight review yet üòÇüòÖ thanks for having me ! Fun flight it was üëç>>><<<As a medical undergraduate and a volunteer working at the National COVID center, staying hydrated is of utmost importance. Infact, what we give as advices for home based care patients are to have adequate bed rest (with awake repositioning for each half an hour) and STAYING HYDRATED (2.5 - 3.5 L / day unless you have CKD or any renal dysfunction). So staying hydrated is even better these days. Great review Josh. Love from Sri Lanka üá±üá∞>>><<<Naize.>>><<<I don&#39;t think it&#39;s discrimination if you&#39;re too fat and take up two seats... that&#39;s just how it is. Those extra extra large people should buy 2 tickets for both of their seats that their fat spills onto.I don&#39;t want someone&#39;s fat rolls touching me while I paid full price for my seat, just because I&#39;m fit and take care of myself lol. Yuck.<br><br>However, with that said, I think MOST fat people can fit in 1 seat just fine. It&#39;s the REALLY fat people that you have to worry about, and honestly, I don&#39;t think those folks mind paying for 2 because they understand that their size can intrude others&#39; personal space.>>><<<what is with your hand in your logo>>><<<Man wasting others time>>><<<Biden gift of 9/11 Anniversary is 3 lacks brave  Afgans Soldiers Partner Interpreters  who cant fought Talibans a  US citizenship>>><<<Great video,totally fair as usual.Really looking forward to seeing the Afganni crew again>>><<<The new Scamhansa??>>><<<Had the same idea. Thank you.>>><<<Great video did you here from the airline from the feedback you mentioned ?>>><<<There should be a toilet in front left side of the plane. That toilet should be marginally bigger as it used to be reserved for ScootPlus customers. Once I was sorta told off by the crew for using the toilet, before the crew probably embarrassed himself afterwards when I stepped back to my ScootPlus seat in row 1. <br><br>On another point about service by the Scooties (as the cabin crew are called), I do notice that there aren‚Äôt much service at all even in ScootPlus. This is probably due to the nature that the food and drinks in ScootPlus is ‚Äòrationed‚Äô, you won‚Äôt get more than the one serving of drink that is bundled with your meal. Perhaps Scoot could be more generous to allow additional drink service for ScootPlus passengers, thereby creating ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effect for better customer satisfaction.>>><<<Scoot is bloody awful. There are better options and very little price difference when flying a full service airline after you calculate all the &#39;add-ons&#39; and &#39;don&#39;t gets&#39; with Scoot. It&#39;s not cheap...just nasty.>>><<<Try congo airways>>><<<Your right Josh, with Scoot a &quot;Guest of Size&quot; who are unable to put both arm rests down, must buy two seats together or pay for the Premium Cabin. <br>Great to see you flying with one of your supporters, well done Josh and Adrian.<br>Cant wait to see the Afghan Angels, incredible crew, I hope they fly again soon.>>><<<Great video josh, was extremely surprised tbh !>>><<<Does Scoot still play Enjoy The Silence as boarding music?>>><<<Props to Adrian for taking the hit for us Patrons! No seriously, you did a great job üëèüëè and as always thanks Josh for keeping us all informed ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç‚úàÔ∏è>>><<<Looks like you had a retort meal Josh.>>><<<Well electricity does cost money to generate but something like a plane, train,bus or ship is generating it anyhow  as a byproduct so it does seem very strange to charge passengers for it and the electrical drain for charging phones,etc would be very small not like you are plugging in a fan heater or a toaster!>>><<<Sound was not great on this one.

May I ask you if you wanna sit next to a person which is taking half of your seat? For me this would be a desaster and would make me angry to this person. Also the airline is bruning (approx) 2x more fuel than a normal person.>>><<<So great to have one of your Pateron supporters on board with you and chatting like old friends. Adrian and Josh both looked like they had fun (even with hiccups in train strikes etc.) I always like watching Josh, as much for his airline review but more for his genuine and fun personality. <br><br>Scoot looked like a nice airline and a cool touch with the refreshing welcome drink. I love their motto ‚ÄúSit back, relax, escape the ordinary.‚Äù It works as a good motto for life. Shame about the food, it didn‚Äôt look appetising and sorry it gave you a bit of a stomach pain. <br><br>I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me but Josh seems to stay young. I watched a video from 4 years ago and he looked exactly the same!! In 4 years I look so old by comparison! Wouldn‚Äôt mind a video on his diet or health regime at some point hahahah! <br><br>Seriously though, great job and another well spent time on YouTube! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüôå>>><<<That Afghanistan video sounds amazing. Really looking forward to that.>>><<<Scoot really shot themselves in the foot by combining both flights. Now there&#39;s a travel bubble between Singapore &amp; Germany and fully vaccinated passengers no longer have to quarantine in SIN on arrival <b>except</b> this Scoot flight from Berlin, because it stops in ATH. Obviously, people will take the fully greenlighted Singapore Air &amp; Lufthansa flights from FRA &amp; MUC and not this one. I wonder if Scoot will change anything or continue to miss out on the travel bubble traffic. <br><br>As for you &amp; your &quot;chatty&quot; friend booking them in biz - why, oh why? Economy sells for less than half and is perfectly fine for that 2.5 hrs flight.>>><<<I flew it Mel BKK a couple of years ago and hated it. Terrible food. Just microwaved mush. Crew otherwise disappeared until the seatbelt light came on when they would charge through waking everyone up regardless of whether they had their belt on.<br>The other way, I flew Malindo premium and it was great.>>><<<Please Visit Bangladesh To DubaiüôÇ>>><<<Beats me why countries give away their fifth freedom rights.>>><<<It‚Äôs a budget airline.

Are you planning to make one? Cheers, great work!>>><<<How is that business class?>>><<<Really convinced by Scoot! Flew the route in Scoot Plus two weeks ago by myself with a private Jet feeling included. Would love to go on a longer flight to Singapore with them one day! :)>>><<<I request you to update how to fly abroad in this pandemic happens.<br>I also want to fly away without being made me stay in small room for 2weeks>>><<<How many passengers were on board?! less than20?>>><<<Granted, this is a low cost carrier, BUT. 200 euros for a two and a half hour flight in Europe, on a widebody, and not in a standard European 3-3 business class on a narrow body is not bad at all. I would choose this over any European legacy carrier any day of the week for a short hop intra-European.>>><<<Scoot has always been Rubbish>>><<<My Scoot flying experience remains to be one of the worst I‚Äôve had and I do a bit of flying because of my job. The airline seems to be intent on maximizing revenue per passenger.  The flight crew is a terrible batch of very possibly Singapore Airline rejects.>>><<<Shorts are bad for travelling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBlRmAAp6J8">https://youtu.be/uBlRmAAp6J8</a>>>><<<Not expecting anything of quality in a no frills, but you get too little for what you pay compared to lccs from neighboring countries. Its due to singapore having expensive labor compared to elsewhere in the region.<br><br>For intra europe flights, I&#39;d rather take ryanair and pay 5 times less>>><<<So someone basically sitting on your lap the whole flight because they are morbidly overweight does not violate any laws? I am glad somebody had the courage to stand up for us normal passengers who have to endure hours of inconvenience because someone has no self-control.>>><<<Always handsome<br>üíùüíùüíù<br>‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br>üíùüíùüíù>>><<<Hi josh , Another great flight review .

I‚Äôm already looking forward to you next trip report üëç>>><<<Nice content>>><<<Love the content Josh keep it up>>><<<I cannot address the legalities, I have no legal training, but as a fat person myself, I recognise that there are limits, the comfort of my neighbour needs to be considered.  However, they should give some idea of size limits if they are going to insist on two seats for fat people.  So what is the maximum waist size they will accommodate?  They should tell me how much weight I need to lose to travel with them!  <br>Thank you for the video.>>><<<I did not know Scoot was flying there>>><<<Usually with food if is smells funny I wont eat it>>><<<Never in my life even having an Asian mother or visiting most South East Asian countries including Singapore have I ever heard of Oriental Treasure Rice. I know of 8 treasure rice which is a gluttonous rice and coconut milk based Asian rice pudding dessert which is actually very yummy but not Oriental Treasure rice. Looks like its got shitake mushrooms, lap cheong (pork sausage), chicken, soya sauce and rice. To be honest I&#39;d give that a pass and have the sweeter Treasure rice dessert anytime.>>><<<Can I have the mushrooms please, Josh?>>><<<14th in line.üôÇ>>><<<Hello dear.   94üëçüëçü•Äü•Äüíùüíùüíù>>><<<I&#39;ve heard, that Nonstop Dan had an awful experience with Scoot and will never fly with them.

Turned out they would only accept a credit card not a Visa/Mastercard debit card.>>><<<Everyone is particularly bashing Scoot. You probably have an extremely high standard. You can&#39;t approach full service and LCC with the same standards. Fly Scoot and compare against Spirit. Then you might not complain so much. Or against Jetblue... Jetblue is at least a higher quality LCC. What you&#39;re willing to fork out, that&#39;s exactly what you get.>>><<<You wont catch me on any Boeing Dreamliner or MAX regardless of which airline are operating them, after the Chief Safety Engineer of Boeing for 30yrs(now retired) said that those aircraft are not safe because of shortcuts in manufacture which can lead to catastrophic failure &amp; recommend people NOT to fly in those aircraft!...yes many airlines still use those planes, does that make them safe? personally i would trust the Chief Safety Engineer whose calls to fix the problems went unheeded!>>><<<Terminal 1 is such a mess, head over to Terminal 3 and you will appreciate the large open floor space with multitudes of working spaces and shops that sell food &amp; beverage !>>><<<Another issue with Scoot is that there is no flight connection.  You need to wait to collect your luggage from the previous flight and recheck in again in the next flight.  Make sure you have at least 3-4 hours layover plus your visa to Singapore. If your are not fast enough you may miss the next flight. This is a hidden feature when flying with Scoot.  After considerations, i gave up and booked regular flights.  Its is not too expensive at all. Also Scoot charged every little things onboard and with minimum services.  This is the same principle used by Air Asia and Vietjetair.>>><<<scoot i think got mix reviews ah, sometimes i see always flight delay. i never taken before>>><<<Thanks for sharing! No issues with there being no TV/screen on board but any adapters or USB charger slots available on board?>>><<<Do NOT fly Scoot if you value yourself. This airline lost my trench coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and refused to compensate for the loss. What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating the same BS again and again.>>><<<Amax in spore has already gone down hill for the last 20 year ++ visa/master is the play safe way..>>><<<There‚Äôs actually a lot of seats area in Singapore airport, very comfortable to work. Maybe you missed it. There should be a water dispenser after the security check. The reason to makes the security check at the gate are so that everyone got more time to shop and enjoy the facilities that Changi Airport can offer. That‚Äôs totally make sense. If you‚Äôre flying a normal airline, you won‚Äôt need to buy water as you could just get it from the cabin crew, and if you are flying with a budget airlines, they depend you to purchase water and food onboard for profit. So it totally make sense ya?>>><<<Welcome to the Philippines!!>>><<<Airasia is better than scoot. But sia&#39;s full service is one of the best in the world.<br><br>SIA - top two airlines in the world.

We hope to dedicate a video in order to solve the problems that occur in many airlines in America, Canada, Europe and various countries, when a person is very advised and influences the person on his side. Here is the problem. The people who advise must pay the amount for two seats so that they do not crowd others. We are facing this problem. This problem must be solved In fact, all companies think only for the sake of money, not for the sake of human comfort, and this is what we see, and this is considered a big mistake, and planes that transport passengers must be well maintained for the safety of aviation and for the safety of society. Many accidents have occurred and the reason is a lack of maintenance, and this is considered very important. The danger of companies only thinking about how to collect money. They did not look at the safety of society. They did not look at the safety of the plane, especially the maintenance. Maintenance is important, especially the engines and all the equipment. During my trip in America, the flying was very not good in terms of food and in terms of cleanliness. An international law must be put in place in terms of cleanliness and in terms of treatment as well as maintenance. The plane is for the safety of people>>><<<can you do ZipAir>>><<<i saw some post on reddit complaining about this flight and how obnoxious and invasive samchui was>>><<<This is very hard job. üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ   üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä  ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§>>><<<I want to go to SG but I&#39;m afraid to fly because of turbulent üòìüòì>>><<<ŸÖŸÜÿ™ÿ∏ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸäŸÖŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß  <br> ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÜÿßŸáŸÑÿßÿß ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ <br> ÿ™ÿßÿÆÿ±ÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿßŸà ŸäŸÖŸÉŸà ÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanik>>><<<ŸÖŸÜÿ™ÿ∏ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸäŸÖŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß  <br> ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÜÿßŸáŸÑÿßÿß ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ <br> ÿ™ÿßÿÆÿ±ÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿßŸà ŸäŸÖŸÉŸà ÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanikŸäŸÑÿß ÿ™ŸÖÿßŸÖ ŸÜÿπŸÖ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿßŸäŸä ŸàŸäŸÜŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ <br>ŸÑŸä ÿßÿ™ÿ±ŸÉ ŸàŸäŸÜŸÉ ŸÉÿßŸÅŸä ÿÆŸÑÿßÿµ ÿßÿ™ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ®ÿßŸäŸÑ ÿπŸÜÿØŸÉ ŸäŸÖŸÉŸà  ŸäŸÑÿß ÿßÿ∞ÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸÑŸä ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ™ÿßÿÆÿ±ÿ™ yala adha wasalat li takhart yla tamaam naeam yala ayi wink ant yimuk ylan wasalat li atruk wiink kafi khalas atruk almubayil eindak yumak>>><<<ŸÖŸÜÿ™ÿ∏ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸäŸÖŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß <br> ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÜÿßŸáŸÑÿßÿß ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™  <br> ÿ™ÿßÿÆÿ±ÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿßŸà ŸäŸÖŸÉŸà ÿ≥ÿßÿπŸá ÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ yalan mu ntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuliyal aalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamak matanikŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±Ÿá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿπÿ¨ŸÑÿ™ ÿßÿ±Ÿàÿ≠ ÿßŸÜÿß ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß ŸÑŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉŸàŸäÿßŸÖÿ™ÿßŸÜŸäŸÉyulawsalat sayaaruh aistaejalat aruh ana shukran lak yulawasalt yamkuyamtanik>>><<<ŸÖŸÜÿ™ÿ∏ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿß<br> ŸÑŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™yalan muntaziruk ana wasalat yla yulawasalt ana yla lilbaytŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ÿ≥ÿßÿπŸá ÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑ ŸàŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±Ÿá ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß ŸÑŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿπÿ¨ŸÑŸá ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸäŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±Ÿá yulawsalat albayt saeah taeal wyn alsayaaruh shukran lak ylan mustaejiluh tanik yla yla bisayar>>><<<ŸÖŸÜÿ™ÿ∏ÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿß ŸäŸÖŸÉ ŸäŸÑÿß ÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ÿß  <br> ŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ ÿßŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÜÿßŸáŸÑÿßÿß ŸäŸÑÿßŸàÿµŸÑÿ™ <br> ÿ™ÿßÿÆÿ±ÿ™ ŸäŸÑÿßŸà ŸäŸÖŸÉŸà ÿµŸÑÿ™ ŸäŸÖŸÉ yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanik>>><<<I‚Äôve seen that exact plane on Flightradar24>>><<<Try flying Ryanair Wizz air and Cebu pacific and Zipair>>><<<This is so refreshing seeing how it really work>>><<<What about Vietnam airline?>>><<<If I were on that flight I would be keeping everything that Sam served me for souvenirs !!

Water has always been free and the water they give you is such a small amount for 4 US dollars that your still thirsty afterwards. Their food was horrible too. And of course the crew members were very rude. They had a rude attitude and if you&#39;d press the flight attendant light they would take ages to come. Honestly , I would never fly it again and I wish I knew before flying because that was suppose to be one of the best trips of my life.>>><<<Sam, you somehow convinced me to book with Scoot in my next flight ‚úàÔ∏è.

I flew Sin-Syd  in early March 23 and got a seat totally torn and pasted with masking tape. No fault of the crew - but no service recovery other than a blanket.

Quality service, Equipment>>><<<I flew on Scoot from Sydney to Singapore. Their service levels were on par or better than a full service carrier. One of the crew saw that my 8 year old daughter was fascinated by what they were doing, so they asked if they could take her out to the galley and give her a bit of a tour. After 30 minutes went by, I got up to go and find her only to discover 4 of the crew doing her hair to match theirs before they got her to help out as though she was part of the team. Next minute, she‚Äôs walking down the aisle being helpful! She was so happy and the crew were genuinely spectacular. That was years ago now and she still talks about it.>>><<<You are inspirational Sam. I would just love to try being cabin crew for a day. I think being cabin crew on a low cost airline is much more demanding than full service.>>><<<what an idea... a good way to give people some new experience in aviation industryüëçüëçüëç>>><<<Sam, what can  I say but &quot;good on you&quot;, for putting yourself out there on the receiving end.

Respect for the Scoot team, they are working hard.>>><<<Last month was the first time I travel abroad in my life out of Malaysia (because I&#39;m no rich people), when I flew to Melbourne using Scoot. It will always hold a special place in my heart because it was really the first time in my life to flew inside other airlines aside from Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia. Here&#39;s to flying more.>>><<<I enjoyed this video Sam‚Ä¶>>><<<That was a great addition Sam,  but my only trouble budget airlines shouldn‚Äôt ask passengers to pay for the food service it should be provided and delivered to the passenger‚Äôs seat but this is a budget airline for short haul flights, Scoot is different and the crew is wonderful including the senior staff. Congratulations Sam you did well. <br>You need to work on your landings though. Namaste brother.>>><<<Hey Sam, awesome flight and loved the flight attendant Ms. Bubu bless her heart.  And do you think at some point you may pursue the commercial pilot&#39;s license after sampling the 787 via their flight simulator?  Very very nice.  Please keep coming out with more vlogs!!>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyLAXLife">https://www.youtube.com/@MyLAXLife</a>>>><<<We&#39;re flying Scoot in a few months time from Australia to Singapore. I read complaints online but most seem quite minor. Cost of water which does seem excessive. Also, cost of charging devices, Food quality.  Anyway, It is a budget airline with good aircraft, so I think we&#39;ll survive. üòÅ>>><<<Excellent Sam. A flight attendant‚Äôs life seems so glamorous, but here we see it‚Äôs hard work, and I‚Äôve much better insight. Thank you.>>><<<He is doing it for a low-cost airline>>><<<When are u coming back to Trinity and give us a speech.‚ù§>>><<<Bubu is a pro and great teacher>>><<<I‚Äôm sure flying with Sam Chui would be fun.<br><br>However this makes total sense!  It‚Äôs Scoot!  Flew them last year Singapore-Macau round trip.  As a subsidiary of the normally excellent and full service Singapore Airlines, Scoot couldn‚Äôt be more the polar opposite.  We had only about 25-30 passengers when I flew last spring under tight Covid restrictions.  As there is only one class‚Ä¶economy on these flights, I paid a little extra to get an aisle seat on an emergency row.  I do this regularly on Air √Åsia.  Upon entering the aircraft in Singapore, I noticed something strange immediately.  Many people crammed in the back of the aircraft.  Why?  <br>I sat down in my seat and buckled up.  However it wasn‚Äôt until after the aircraft began to taxi, I realized the reasons.  I wasn‚Äôt seated in an Economy Plus seat!  But why?  I had paid for it.  <br><br>I inquired with the flight attendant.  Turns out they had switched aircraft type after I bought my ticket since Covid meant fewer passengers.  The passengers crammed in the back?  Those seats no longer existed on the smaller aircraft!  They had not bothered to adjust any seating.<br><br>Finally they moved me to a Economy Plus seat after the meal, but it took way to long and they seemed to be arguing about whether to even do that!<br><br>As directed, I filed a complaint online with the airline, but they never bothered to even respond.  <br><br>Another thing, Scoot operates completely independent of Singapore Air.  When connecting, don‚Äôt expect Singapore Air to help in any way.  It‚Äôs like Scoot is kryptonite.<br><br>Arriving in Macau, we found out that seating was important in regards to Covid protocols!  We were immediately isolated and tested and one passenger had Covid.  So there was added scrutiny around seating assignments.  Then we started our crazy two weeks of hotel quarantine!<br><br>But Scoot?  It was virtually the only way in or out of Macau at the time without quarantining in yet another country first.  <br><br>Glad Sam enjoyed his flight, but I won‚Äôt be joining him.  But it is like cheap SCOOT to promote their airline by hiring Sam for one day!>>><<<Another awesome video Sam, Thank you!>>><<<You&#39;re really funny Sam. I enjoy your Vlogs so much. It&#39;s a complete entertainment package.>>><<<So cool of scoot to allow you to experience this. üòÇ>>><<<I appreciate for your video. I know that every work is not easy but I dont expect flight attendants this more difficult. Thank you for your work to all flight attendants. To remind all passengers, we are guests to their house once on a plane. So be patients, polite, and kind to the house owners and guests on the plane that like you. Don&#39;t forget be safe and use seat belt once required.>>><<<A good one, Sam. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you want to become a licensed pilot one day. Ah, but you can‚Äôt be bothered with too much work. üòî>>><<<MY REVIEW:<br>Hi Sam. I met you at Clutter Park last time you were  there.  This video is incredible. THE audio is loud, and level and clear and perfect from start to finish.  Everyone has excellent audio.  The multiple cameras was great.  From the cams in the kitchen to inside and outside the simulator.  Cams in the cockpit watching the crew and cams watching the runway and landing and controls. Cams in the cabin with many different angles. Incredible editing and transitions. The flight crew speaking with you like you were a co-worker and friend. This was like a Hollywood production. I loved the humanity of it all. I felt connected to the staff and the flight.  The feelings and emotions you expressed while working- from fun to tired, to sore back.. Very human and real.  With a live shoot like this, there is no way to script this, but it was perfect from start to finish.  THE PR  gained from this video will be powerful.  Anyone watching this video would want to fly Singapore.  You made them proud. The warmth and kindness and stunning beauty of the staff really comes through.  I felt appreciation and a connection to all the flight crew.  This was impressive and professional.... Nothing self serving or ego about this- Just darn good production and a video of perfection.  Now I understand why doors open for you and you are given the access you get. Thanks for sharing this with the viewers... thank you Flight crew and Singapore airlines...>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxGs3uBGk8c&amp;t=191">03:11</a> cute couple... when is the wedding? üòÄ>>><<<‚ù§‚ù§ great video üòäüòä>>><<<This was awesome!

I hope I can fly this route with scoot soon.>>><<<What was the duration of the flight??>>><<<Nice job Felix!>>><<<Come to yangon>>><<<I realize that Scoot is the low cost off shoot of Singapore Airlines.  That so-called ‚ÄúBusiness Class‚Äù looks nothing more than Premium Economy with the meal to match.  Speaking of which, if one didn‚Äôt like fish, what was the other option if any?  There‚Äôs probably a good 40 year difference in our ages so at this stage of the game, low cost carriers/Business Class that‚Äôs not exactly that would not be for me.  Nevertheless, I enjoy your videos.  Keep up the good work!>>><<<Go to malaysia im there>>><<<Finally!

I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.<br><br>In summary, AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot from SIN to ATH, and it was very pleasant. Not torturous at all. Also not a huge amount of legroom, but it was okay. As I was on an SQ codehare ticket, I had free meals, and was allowed to keep the blanket as a souvenir. Scoot is my favourite low cost airline.>>><<<Experienced Scoot flights Manila to SG to Gold Coast AU ages ago on a return trip, then Singapore to Manila last January, all nice.>>><<<Brilliant video mate>>><<<Great video!

Just two questions: which hotel did you stay in Singapore and what area? Also, did scoot offer you an upgrade to scoot plus via email or when checking in, and if so how much extra was the upgrade?  That was an expensivie return flight to Aus!  Probably could have bought a return ticket with Qantas for that much,and gained QFF points as well..Jetstar also flies from Melbourne to Singapore ( since scoot don‚Äôt fly there), perhaps worth a try next time?>>><<<Great video. Interestingly, the online prices ( as add ons ) for the meals shown on your Scoot Cafe menu are AUD$19.00 I don&#39;t think SGD$12.00 converts to AUD$19.00 Something is out of whack or they have a currency conversion that rivals PayPal&#39;s<br>Did you use the fancy new check in kiosks at Changi ?>>><<<Does this kind of turbulance only shake ? or do they also drop? i&#39;m afraid of the dropping feeling. had once sudden drop when i took jetstar>>><<<Hey, may I know how&#39;s the leg room of it?>>><<<Nice one! Thanks for sharing. I am very keen to try Scoot between Sydney and Singapore. Hopefully sometime next year. So many places to visit, just not enough holidays away from work!<br>It is a bit annoying when they control the tint on the windows!>>><<<I Have not flew whit Scoot yet.Changi is World best Air Port is my Opiniun.Great work>>><<<Nice vid bro!>>><<<You chose well, flying on the day service. I cannot imagine doing this on a red eye. Yes, Scoot charges you for EVERYTHING except the air you breathe. Personally, I think the best value LCC is still Air Asia because you&#39;re paying everything in MYR which is so damn cheap, especially your meals. Hahahaha... I am glad the crew were jovial. Nothing better than that to set the tone. I love bumpy flights, and seated at the end tip - your experience is actually multiplied with the plane bending etc. Its fun! It looks like the airline has grown kinder the lay-overs... It used to be 24hrs. The fact that they get 2 nites now must be such a relief. Great video as always!>>>
