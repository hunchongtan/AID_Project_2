hav question who fly route berlin bkk stop in athen 1hr just stay in the same airplane no need to get off right are there many late amp cancelation happened frequently i really not sure but price for the other airline are super crazy ,Other,YouTube
no way to travel ,Other,YouTube
flew with scoot from sydney to sg never again lmao i think i can still handle sg tokyo or sg hk but that 7 30 hrs red eye flight was simply the most tiring leg of flight i ever took,Other,YouTube
they are not even a budget airline once you add in luggage it is cheaper to fly a normal airline just a totally pointless exercise as far as i can see basically a scam ,Other,YouTube
this is just dehumanising ,Other,YouTube
video is great not recommended this airline specially long tirp ,Other,YouTube
honestly the other airlines are not too much better same 3 3 3 configuration only major difference is in flight entertainment and a mediocre tv dinner,Other,YouTube
seems kinda rough for that long of a flight ,Other,YouTube
what on earth is economy class ,Other,YouTube
definitely not for me ,Other,YouTube
this just highlights how much other airlines overcharge you compared to the cost of the plane maintenance fuel staff etc removing inflight entertainment meals etc is not a huge saving yet there is a huge difference in ticket price ,Other,YouTube
just fyi electricity on a plane is not free in the 787 there are separate generators that consume jet fuel to make electricity a regular plane has a generator section connected to the engines that takes more fuel to make electricity also the electronics to convert that energy into usable passenger adds weight making the plane less fuel efficient that said still a rip off omg never ever heard of an airline that charges for electricity heck even southwest does not do that oh wait they do not have it at all lol good video ,Other,YouTube
how much is it to use the bathroom and is there number 2 surcharge ,Other,YouTube
not even entertainment bruh,Other,YouTube
if i really had to go places and paying anything extra for a proper flight would harm my financial stability or prohibit me from doing other stuff i want to do at my destination i would consider it but other than that that is just no form of flying i do not quite unterstand why low cost carriers are always so keen on showing the world that they are shitty eurowings is low cost too but they at least have a primitive ife on a plane setting you back 200 million dollars there is no reason to save the 50k they would have to pay for ife make people pay a few bucks to use it or even 3 sgd per film if you want but at least offer it this cabin looks like from 40 years ago there is nothing wrong with cutting costs as an airline in order to offer cheap tickets but why not make an effort to make things as comfortable as possible without spending lots of money cramp them seats in there make me pay for food and ife make me pay for the electricity if you feel the need but at least offer smth and dim the lights color these seats in a way i sent get eye cancer ,Other,YouTube
would have been good if you told us the price of a comparable flight with a better carrier as i do not fly there otherwise amazing vid ,Other,YouTube
honestly i think this video would attract many more casual viewers if it was called something more catchy like the longest low cost flight in the world then the rest of the video title great video otherwise ,Other,YouTube
worst looking cabin food ever unless im dying from hunger their flghts notoriously famous for delays too again unless its a mega sale fare or only airline to fly that desti ,Other,YouTube
it is the unscheduled delays and cancellations that make scoot a gamble,Other,YouTube
im not impressed livestock transport flight ,Other,YouTube
not all heroes wear capes some document long haul budget flights for the bros ,Other,YouTube
without ife is one thing without ife amp power to charge my devices is whole other thing need to bring a few power bank to live thru that,Other,YouTube
i avoid airlines that offer low fares then remove amenities like power ports for the sake of recovering revenue also no in flight entertainment come on also noted and agree other low cost carrier air asia has surprisingly decent food options in their santan line uncle chin is chicken rice is a personal favorite ,Other,YouTube
no i would not ,Other,YouTube
book singapore airlines instead they own scoot ,Other,YouTube
i would not ,Other,YouTube
stupid airline charges for power,Other,YouTube
worst food they changed my flight schedule without proper notification and the ticket priced also not cheap they also charged me for extra 5 kilos of luggage that i did not even brought with me athens singapore manila and returned 2022  ,Other,YouTube
scoot sucks even 4 hours singapore to manila and back recently connecting flights booked unwittingly by singapore air from south africa not cheap either both flights were late staff were inexperienced adolescents treated like sheep uncomfortable food was rubbish horrible experience as part of a long haul singapore has hand in this damaging their brand for sure ,Other,YouTube
just went on a flight from sin to ool gold coast australia but now they are suspending the route so sad ,Other,YouTube
i tried 7 hours on scoot from tokyo to singapore on business class thinking there will be entertainment there was 1 microwaved meal 1 bottled 300ml water and bigger seat not even wine if you want to purchase i ended up staring into blank and forcing myself to sleep starving  gt lt will do it again but with my own entertainment alot of food and a bottle of wine ,Other,YouTube
ye,Other,YouTube
i have tried jetstar from melbourne to bangkok approximately 9 10 hrs basic eco without food or drinks the worst experience ever mostly from the other passengers i was not aware that cheap price would come with lower quality people no manner loud noise walking around like they are visiting the zoo never do low cost long haul flight again ,Other,YouTube
that kinda felt like always being at mercy i mean i am okay with having no food movies and blankets but that feeling like being looked upon as peasants having to pay for anything you touch is unsettling and on a long haul flight having no leg space and no reclining seat i know there are people who hardly care about such things and i really envy them but its dreadful for me on the other hand its perfect for a short journey say about 4 hours ,Other,YouTube
please do vietjet is international economy ,Other,YouTube
idc how uncomfortable this is need this to japan from the central us getting there cheap is so worth it or any asian country really because even in japan you get a good deal for the us dollar,Other,YouTube
just a little aside 2 litres of water a day is a myth you need 2 litres of any liquid and that includes water contained in food as well as dehydrating drinks such as coffee ,Other,YouTube
those meals looked like dog food,Other,YouTube
the point about water is valid to a degree are you sure there was no way of asking for tap water i know for a fact you can do this on other budget airlines also water bottles exist,Other,YouTube
so your main complain is a 333 ml water bottle at 3euros ,Other,YouTube
was not this channel about silent reviews with captions and steadi cam style shots i liked the style better this is way too in your face ,Other,YouTube
next level of payment for seat for toilet for food delivery you pay for food but not for delivery for smile ,Other,YouTube
i feel the not so good quality of nasi lemak was there just to irritate the malaysians xd joke only dun take it too srsly,Other,YouTube

weird concept if you book everything you are over 1000eur in may singapore airlines charges 876 for the same dates ,Other,YouTube
just no ,Other,YouTube
pay to use power source omg getoutathere,Other,YouTube
tbh i do not see too much of a problem in the lack of in flight entertainment but the lack of wi fi is bad and water just water howdys from a person with kidney issues ,Other,YouTube
not on your life great vids  ,Other,YouTube
maybe i will try to fly with scootbut really not on such a long flight do they want extra money for using their toilets too and won t ever fly from this airport catastrophy the first berlin airport that is not in berlin that no one ever needed that costed much much more than it should have cost ,Other,YouTube
it was the cheap passengers that wanted the lowest fare for creation of no thrill airlines of course you have to pay for expensive foods if you paid cheap tickets we have plenty of cattle class airlines in the u s spirit frontier southwest i do not feel sorry for poor people suffering ,Other,YouTube
having no ife is not such a big deal back in the day ife on a b747 meant a movie projected onto a bulkhead screen so only some passengers got a good viewing angle and the audio was piped through tubes to headphones amp quality of the audio was atrocious and you could listen to radio shows etc through a menu system so most people brought books to read ,Other,YouTube
i honestly strongly disagree on classifying scoot as low cost or even ultra low cost same exact thing with nearby jetstar the biggest supporting fact to this is that those two low cost long haul carriers are still in business while norwegian has gone backrupt those two airlines scoot amp jetstar which are always mentioned as example of low cost long haul thanks to the 787 appear to be low cost because the main comparison is to their parent companies they are the eurowings of asia oceania pretty much they are not low cost they are lower cost compared to very high prices of their mainline high standard full service parent airlines singapore airlines qantas and lufthansa ,Other,YouTube
does not scoot ban from taking outside food source  ,Other,YouTube
depends can you bring food onboard ,Other,YouTube
i think i would go for max 3 4 hours maybe 5 but thats really maybe would have to be such a huge price difference or other flight would be with long layover and etc 12 hours in low cost never otherwise nice video i like this series ,Other,YouTube
i would never do it but i watched the video anyway ,Other,YouTube
what a shameee these airlines should bankrupt i hate low cost carriers they changes the way of flying ,Other,YouTube
scoot apparently does not allow you to eat your own food onboard which is mind blowing to me ,Other,YouTube
what next charge extra for using the restroom ,Other,YouTube
on december 2022 i have ever tried flying scoot 787 8 9v ofe from osaka kansai to singapore changi for 7 hours and i even sat at the same seat as you 33k sadly it is a different plane but the flight did not feel good i was so bored during the flight and thirsty as well ,Other,YouTube

flied scoot many years ago with my kids booked online and was checking out to make payment when prompted to add on inflight entertainment using own devices accepted add on then complete the payment once on plane inflight did not work staff then showed list of compatible devices felt cheated asked for refund negative asked to replace with food negative only given a email address to write in wrote in help desk from philippines called complained that during booking not highlighted about list of compatible devices help desk could not do anything lesson learnt marketing not connected with operation ,Other,YouTube

hey fly scoot is not worst,Other,YouTube
the title worst is rather misleading i have flown on scoot numerous times between singapore and various australian cities for the price it is quite hard to beat have flown singapore to sydney return for lt sdollar300 fly only no bag before i think your expectations are at the wrong level which will obviously lead to disappointment ,Other,YouTube

i flew scoot biz mel sin dmk once that was truly awful ,Other,YouTube
try jetstar josh they are also really good at fleecing passengers,Other,YouTube
i have flown scoot a few times from aus to sin and v v at the right price they are fantastic i am talking dollar150 aud one way once the fares move into the 250 400 range one way the value quickly decreases one other positive is they ans airasia are pretty good for last minute fares compared to a full service last minute ,Other,YouTube
im very confused as to why you are bitching about a low cost carrier the main premise of scoot is to get you from point a to b thats it you decide if you want anything else as you decided to fly a low cost airline of course all the extras are way overpriced as thats how they make money if you want food drinks and entertainment fly a main airline simple completely unnecessary video ,Other,YouTube
no josh no not liverpool bro haha,Other,YouTube

i recently flew gatwick to bangkok with scoot in economy and can best describe it as a discomfort endurance test the crew were ok but 12 hrs is a long flight especially when you are sat waiting to take off and you are delayed by an hr and a half no food or even drinking water no power outlets no entertainment nothing unless you pay extra fortunately i came prepared but being a first time scoot flyer i do not think i will use them again and as this vid has shown business class is not much better ,Other,YouTube

i might be in the minority here but i have flown ana and ua 787s and i can not notice a difference in the noise level or the pressure the only thing i did notice was that the wing flex was insane and that the tips looked like they are above the cabin roof i was sitting in business and businessfirst if that makes a difference with the the noise much rather prefer a 777 300er or the old school 747 400 which i am sitting in right now in upper deck than a 787,Other,Reddit
