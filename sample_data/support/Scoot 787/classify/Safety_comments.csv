scoot lost my armani coat which was in the checked in luggage and they refused to compensate for the loss i followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why  what is even worse is that scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating you should do this and you should do that again and again for more than a month i have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter but no one was available  in summary avoid scoot at all cost if you value your time and money ,Safety,YouTube

i took scoot on a fifth freedom flight from berlin to athens one year ago which obviously was not such a bad experience compared to the other options you have on this route but i seriously can not imagine to be onboard their boeing 787 for 13 hours so thanks that you sacrificed yourself for me  ,Safety,YouTube
back in february 2020 just before covid hit my parents and i were on vacation in indonesia we were checking flight offers from berlin still txl back then to denpasar and were actually considering scoot for a moment i watched a trip report on their 787 too i think it might have even been on this channel we decided against it eventually especially because my mom would not agree to spending 12 hours without entertainment when we finally went to indonesia again over christmas 2022 almost 3 years later we still decided for full service airlines instead it is worth the extra money to us xd the longest low cost flight i had so far was on easyjet from berlin ber to sharm el sheik in egypt around 4 hours of flight time time the return flight obviously yea that was painful enough i think the longest i would agree to would be 6 hours,Safety,YouTube

i am actually so glad that you guys did a brutally honest episode on scoot as a not so rich singaporean i frequently fly on scoot to visit my family in china since they were the only airline that operated direct flights to those cities in china which basically means i frequently fly 8 5 hours on their 787 and 5 5 hours on their a320 which is very painful it is definitely not ideal but its like the only thing i can afford ,Safety,YouTube
i flew scoot from berlin to athens last year good enough for the 3 hours but i do not think i would want to fly the entire way to singapore with them,Safety,YouTube
actually i don t really need ife or food for 12h i can use my tablet computer to entertain myself and bring a few snacks with me to keep me from starving my major issue with scoot is about the legroom being 190cm tall there is no way to stay on this plane for longhaul what i really love is the silence area every airline should introduce an area where no small children or drunk douchebags are allowed ,Safety,YouTube

hi josh i live in r p as an expat and fly to perth australia normally twice a year as i fund all my own travels i mostly use lcc as there are so many choices if i was to choose the most reliable lcc i would likely say air asia i have had the least delays and never yet had a flight schedule change i use 5j alot as i am a sucker for cheaper prices but i must say they are the most unreliable lcc consistently changes to schedules and always delaying flights i can not recall the last time i was not delayed in saying that they have provided me very cheap fares given you book ahead of time and with there famous 1 piso fare promotion i used them recently to guam similar flight time between sin and mnl for dollar75usd roundtrip that is an absolute bargain jetstar asia i find decent but once again i do not use them as much as i once did since they no longer operate sin per like cebu pacific jetstar asia have a tendency to reschedule flights which is a hassle as in customer service and on time departures 3k are sound finally scoot i have had my fair share of schedule changes with them and you make an excellent point their flight timings are always early morning or late night which makes connections often prolonged singapore changi i agree is an excellent airport to be stuck at on my last long lay over i walked the entire t3 to t1 to t2 airside and noted the best sleeping areas for future trips as long as you have a pillow changi provide some decent seats and benches for resting one last mention on scoot in january of 2018 my flight was retimed out of per meaning my 2 hr connection in sin was cut my original connection was a red eye leaving singapore about 1am the next available flight was not until around 4pm i know for a fact that the majority of lcc would simply rebook you on the next flight without much in terms of compensation scoot was very generous and i had a free stay at the crowne plaza t1 with buffet meals included i was very surprised they were so generous to sum it up you simply get what you pay for personally flying sectors of 5 hrs or less i can not justify the full service costs sq is my favourite carrier but still the 5 hr rule applies exception expiring sq krisflyer miles which i will consume safe travels to all michael,Safety,YouTube

josh tiger merged with scoot in 2017 so they are really no alternative what your review ignored is that there are two groups of people when it comes to lcc those that book checked luggage food amp seat assignment at time of booking and those that will simply do without these services basically next to nobody pays them those prices listed in the menu scoot days bringing your own food is forbidden but with so few staff that seems rather difficult to enforce fun fact 1 even if you book in what they refer to as business class on their long haul overnight trips to from athens or berlin i believe premium economy is more accurate for what you get you will still have to pay if you want a pillow or blanket fun fact 2 there was the case of a german ngo guy who saw those food prices after having booked a ticket and contacted scoot and told them he would go on a hunger strike in protest he then had to take the threat back i believe scoot told him they would not honor the ticket if he carried out the threat but come day of the trip what did he do just had water which was seen as the same thing end of story he is found himself blacklisted for life from scoot tiger if you go on their website the list something like 25 reasons that will get you banned and making threats even this type which is mostly harming yourself is one of them ,Safety,YouTube

i terracing that u dared fly scoot jayden oh god u used an unfriendly skies pillow you should have eaten at hungry jack is,Safety,YouTube
scoot is a great airline with great staff but the food has always been very ordinary although i like your videos i do hope you get refused boarding one day as you continually break the rule with your overweight cabin baggage you obviously knew it was too much but went ahead anyway just irresponsible ,Safety,YouTube
well after watching your scoot trip i def wont ever fly with them just because they are a cheap carrier that doesnt mean they have to ignore their chores like gathering up rubbish and at least a free water and to remember cutlery if you ordered a meal that was terrible on their behalf omg what was wrong with the black cats face eyes poor thing hope you had fun with your family,Safety,YouTube
it was t1 and not t3 you were at was not it ,Safety,YouTube
coat hook ,Safety,YouTube
hi jayden thank you for the video on scoot not for me neither only if it was an emergency food did not look very good ah well i suppose that what you get on low budget airlines yes you thought they would have given out water ,Safety,YouTube
lol i used to accidentally find airline pillows in my luggage i have not flown red eye in economy in a very time and i will finally do it to europe in december ycl the entire way ,Safety,YouTube
oh god scoot congrats on surviving xd when i flew them from honolulu to osaka they were very insistant on no outside food and drink to force you to buy their gruel i just slept instead haha and they also only had immigration customs cards in chinese for some reason ,Safety,YouTube
inside the flight vlog i noticed that you looked through the meals at least they noticed that they have the allergens advice i assume that most of the meals contain at least gluten however there is no seat pockets but from the singapore hong kong flight you are transiting from a stormy singapore to a sunny hong kong city ,Safety,YouTube
good flight review on scoot very nice jayden ,Safety,YouTube

who cares if the crew are not around talking to the passengers i would rather they chill until you actually need something instead of constantly walking around doing nothing ,Safety,YouTube
heck scoot plus is way better than singapore airlines economy seat ,Safety,YouTube
bro this is a long haul flight ultra low cost airline the seats are already uncomfortable enough and this isnt just a 2h flight most of the time scoot also flies athens to singapore for example and thats like a 10 h flight that would be an unbearable experience for all involved including the large gentleman lady,Safety,YouTube
i looked at the prices for this scoot business class manila to bangkok against philippines airlines business class and the philippines airlines was a far better price and the business class is a real business class prices for this coming november philippines 58000 pesos scoot 70000 pesos no brainier ,Safety,YouTube
there is no screen with video or entertainment ,Safety,YouTube
i thinl thats fair for obese peiple to have to but two tickets,Safety,YouTube
in my opinion it still worth to fly this budget airline with b787 why as long as wifi services provide in the flight i still can enjoy entertainment from my ipad like general commercial carrier does i may not put high expectations on food since it is budget airline but i rather recommend them distribute fast food instead local budget food store  many of you know b787 is the most modern and safe aircraft in the world it can get rid off unpredictable turbulence event happen during journey the wing flow can swing like a bird compare to other aircraft give constant momentum of air flow can help airline company save money on fuel consumption of course you still can enjoy business class or first class on the commercial carrier if you have enough money to do so it just an option for those people wish to take budget airline for their travel when they have budget constraints ,Safety,YouTube
that vpn route to better pricing sure as heck did not work for me one way singapore to sydney and i was using a singapore server not guaranteed i guess did you notice a little button for calling an attendant a meal was included and they delivered it continual fawning was not included ,Safety,YouTube
i flew scoot business a few years ago the flight attendant told me i was not allowed to sleep through meal service on a red eye flight ,Safety,YouTube
you are wrong fat people should not sit in half of my seat ,Safety,YouTube

scoot from singapore down to australia is a great option so cheap usually ,Safety,YouTube
awesome video josh i actually travelled on their dreamliner from my hometown to singapore i had a very bad experience but i made up my mind that i am travelling in a budget airline  ,Safety,YouTube
as a travel agent when they first stepped into the european market i was at their promotion stand on the itb the big international travel and tourism fair in berlin they guy handed us pamphlets and we talked about what we as agents and our customers expect of an airline and they failed in almost every discussion point at one point even the brand representative laughed with us what a weird airline i actually did not think they would stay longer than this weird air france hipster youth airline but hey here we are today xd,Safety,YouTube
the french being more on strike than others is a myth in these last few years lufthansa has been much more on strike than air france and it also works for dbhan against sncf ,Safety,YouTube
we flew scootbiz back in october 2017 melbourne singapore and back the flight to singapore was ok no priority boarding in melbourne although it said it was included on board they got the already ordered food wrong staff were older and very helpful also on the way back no priority boarding long lines at the gate had a younger group of hostesses and they were hopeless not only wrong sort of food we had already booked and paid for but we both received an ice cream instead of a meal to start with no apology when asked why and where were our ordered meals staff never came around to check on us we had 1a amp 1b we decided that the fares were not as cheap as they think they are and to fly singapore next time and pay more for what we want in business class sadly we do not look like getting back to singapore anytime soon we are locked down again in melbourne australia philltheflyer,Safety,YouTube
i think you should try out wow air not sure if they still fly but if they do you should review them,Safety,YouTube
have watched many of your videos amp you always seem to dred having someone sitting next to you without some kind of divider even on short flights you have no problem engaging the crews but almost seem phobic about someone being near you on a passenger aircraft of all things ,Safety,YouTube
imho extra wide passengers should be required to purchase two seats no one in their right mind wants to have someone is fat encroaching their personal space ,Safety,YouTube
were you flying private 787 why i saw no other passengers ,Safety,YouTube
naize ,Safety,YouTube
scoot is bloody awful there are better options and very little price difference when flying a full service airline after you calculate all the add ons and wouldo not gets with scoot it is not cheap just nasty ,Safety,YouTube
your right josh with scoot a guest of size who are unable to put both arm rests down must buy two seats together or pay for the premium cabin great to see you flying with one of your supporters well done josh and adrian can not wait to see the afghan angels incredible crew i hope they fly again soon ,Safety,YouTube
 2 30 in my opinion you are defintily wrong may i ask you if you wanna sit next to a person which is taking half of your seat for me this would be a desaster and would make me angry to this person also the airline is bruning approx 2x more fuel than a normal person ,Safety,YouTube
i flew it mel bkk a couple of years ago and hated it terrible food just microwaved mush crew otherwise disappeared until the seatbelt light came on when they would charge through waking everyone up regardless of whether they had their belt on the other way i flew malindo premium and it was great ,Safety,YouTube
i look forward to seeing your update video about the all female afghanistan crew ,Safety,YouTube
josh by the way i think i haven t seen any ber review by you are you planning to make one cheers great work ,Safety,YouTube
really convinced by scoot flew the route in scoot plus two weeks ago by myself with a private jet feeling included would love to go on a longer flight to singapore with them one day ,Safety,YouTube
so someone basically sitting on your lap the whole flight because they are morbidly overweight does not violate any laws i am glad somebody had the courage to stand up for us normal passengers who have to endure hours of inconvenience because someone has no self control ,Safety,YouTube
i did not know scoot was flying there,Safety,YouTube
i have heard that nonstop dan had an awful experience with scoot and will never fly with them i do not know about your thoughts regarding this situation anyways i trust your reviews more and keep it up ,Safety,YouTube
second bro,Safety,YouTube
first yep ,Safety,YouTube
do they weigh your luggages ,Safety,YouTube
haa i think scoot is both low price and low quality ,Safety,YouTube
i had the same problem with purchasing on scoot turned out they would only accept a credit card not a visa mastercard debit card ,Safety,YouTube
you wont catch me on any boeing dreamliner or max regardless of which airline are operating them after the chief safety engineer of boeing for 30yrs now retired said that those aircraft are not safe because of shortcuts in manufacture which can lead to catastrophic failure amp recommend people not to fly in those aircraft yes many airlines still use those planes does that make them safe personally i would trust the chief safety engineer whose calls to fix the problems went unheeded ,Safety,YouTube
another issue with scoot is that there is no flight connection you need to wait to collect your luggage from the previous flight and recheck in again in the next flight make sure you have at least 3 4 hours layover plus your visa to singapore if your are not fast enough you may miss the next flight this is a hidden feature when flying with scoot after considerations i gave up and booked regular flights its is not too expensive at all also scoot charged every little things onboard and with minimum services this is the same principle used by air asia and vietjetair ,Safety,YouTube
amax in spore has already gone down hill for the last 20 year visa master is the play safe way ,Safety,YouTube
i flew on scoot to ,Safety,YouTube

to be honest this time i took scoot airways back to mainland china from indonesia no matter the transit terminal the oldest t1 the working attitude of the ground staff and the professionalism of the ground staff and the crew i was completely disappointed the complaint email was sent on march 30 as of today 23 days have passed and there is no feedback i advise everyone to avoid low cost airlines if possible if it is unavoidable choose the two flights with the shortest layover time even though scoot is a company owned by singapore airlines it is still a low cost airline and cannot provide even the most basic services moreover singapore t1 is really old small and impersonal ,Safety,YouTube
well scoot is my favourite because powered by singapore airlines,Safety,YouTube

great report welcome to taiwan i hope i can fly this route with scoot soon ,Safety,YouTube
i realize that scoot is the low cost off shoot of singapore airlines that so called business class looks nothing more than premium economy with the meal to match speaking of which if one did not like fish what was the other option if any there is probably a good 40 year difference in our ages so at this stage of the game low cost carriers business class that is not exactly that would not be for me nevertheless i enjoy your videos keep up the good work ,Safety,YouTube
