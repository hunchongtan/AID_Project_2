you and a lot of commenters here seem to quite like scoot for its no frills for the absolute lowest price approach however what always kept me from flying scoot is that it rarely turned out to be this incredible deal that some other commenters were lucky enough to get looking at a return ber sin itinerary for various dates this year scoot is always the cheapest with around 700euros but depending on the dates there are usually turkish or qatar airlines flights available for just 20euros 100euros more even if you do not care about any amenities this would be worth it just for the checked bag alone that is why to me it always seems like flying scoot would only ever be worth it if you are flying one way or if you need the absolute fastest connection between berlin athens to singapore ,Speed,YouTube
