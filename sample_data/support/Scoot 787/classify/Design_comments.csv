electricity on the plane is not free it puts load on the electrical systems which in turn puts load on the generator which by virtual of being connected to the engines puts load on to which consumes fuel so no it is not free if it is provided free it will be charged in the ticket there will be the add issue of calculating fuel to load as it cost fuel to carry more fuel so ya it is not that simple ,Design,YouTube

and someone already painted the sound it made under the windscreen,Design,Reddit
i flew scoot on a couple short hops recently they are fine definitely a low cost carrier but not the lowest of cost carriers planes appeared pretty nice though one engine made a relatively concerning noise on spool up you are packed in there pretty tight which is a bit of a difference coming off a 16 5hr singapore air flight in premium economy but they give you some snacks if you booked through singapore air on a scoot flight would not mind flying them again would be interesting to be on a long haul flight as mine were all on a320s an hour or so ,Design,Reddit
i like how they still chocked the single tire ,Design,Reddit
waiting for it to be evolved ,Design,Reddit
thought that this was a dumb move initially but on further thought i think it is a rly smart move by scoot to capitalise on the london bangkok fifth freedom route the singapore bangkok route is definitely going to be loss making,Design,Reddit
yeah 3 3 3 there are about 30 business class seats 2 2 2 just got back from tianjin gotta say the 787 is pretty awesome cheap prices together with great service make for an excellent flight experience even though meals are expensive ,Design,Reddit
here have this ,Design,Reddit
