You're packed in there pretty tight, which is a bit of a difference coming off a 16.5hr Singapore Air flight in premium economy, but they give you some snacks if you booked through Singapore Air on a Scoot flight. Wouldn't mind flying them again, would be interesting to be on a long haul flight, as mine were all on A320s, an hour or so.>>><<<They're the absolute bottom dogshit of LCCs, will make you pay for literally everything and don't take criticism at all>>><<<I never had fees for carryon or checked luggage, service was prompt, planes were nice on the inside, if barebones, nothing glaringly awful that they could control (crying babies for 15 minutes before landing don't count).

I didn't get charged for carryon, and I guess the times I flew with checked were a ticket booked on Singapore Airlines, who comped that cost.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Travellers heading to London will have more flight choices, with budget carrier Scoot launching services from Singapore to the British capital on Dec 16.

&gt; The low-cost arm of flag carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) said on Friday (Nov 12) that the flights to London's Gatwick Airport via Bangkok will initially take place three times weekly for only two weeks, before resuming on March 22 next year.

&gt; The journey, including transit time in Bangkok, is expected to take about 16½ hours, with one-way tickets priced from $434.

&gt; But passengers targeting quarantine-free travel between Singapore and London can achieve that only on the Scoot flights to London. The return flights are not designated flights that they can use to tap the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme.

&gt; Instead, they will have to book a designated VTL flight, either from British Airways (BA) or SIA. BA operates four such flights to Singapore weekly while SIA offers daily flights.

&gt; Scoot said on Friday that it will use the widebody Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, which can seat more than 300 passengers, for the route.

&gt; It added that the London flights are seasonal scheduled services. A further review and potential increase in frequency will be based on demand and regulatory approval.

&gt; Mr Campbell Wilson, chief executive of Scoot, said the route will enable the airline to benefit from the demand for quarantine-free travel between Britain and Thailand.

&gt; Mr Wilson, who noted that the carrier will be the only low-cost operator between Bangkok and London, added: "The progressive relaxation of international borders presents new opportunities for airlines and travellers alike."

&gt; London will be Scoot's third destination in Europe, after Berlin in Germany and Athens in Greece.

&gt; Scoot will serve more than 30 destinations in December with the addition of London. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was flying to 68 cities.

Still, the opportunity to take a 787 is one not to be passed up, especially when it's guaranteed to be one if you book with this airline>>><<<I might be in the minority here, but I've flown ANA and UA 787s and I can't notice a difference in the noise level or the pressure. The only thing I did notice was that the wing flex was insane and that the tips looked like they are above the cabin roof. 

I was sitting in Business and BusinessFirst if that makes a difference with the the noise. 

Much rather prefer a 777-300er or the old school 747-400 (which I'm sitting in right now in upper deck) than a 787>>><<<Working wise, as I've never flown as a passenger, I think it's fairly noticeable how quieter the 787 is, compared to the 777(-200,-300). As for the pressurization thing, I don't feel any difference, but then from my point of view, the amount of passengers and the configuration I work on makes much more noticeable difference anyway ;) >>><<<I always thought that the pressurization wasn't an immediate effect that you notice but rather not feeling tired and exhausted after the flight. >>><<<I agree. I imagine unless you start testing your lungs by exercising in flight, your not going to notice a difference by immediate feel. >>><<<I think it's more quiet, especially when taxiing. When I took the dreamliner, I sat right over the wings and I thought it was smoother and more quiet. Especially vs the 747-400 or the 77W, the engine noise is noticeable. >>><<<Just flew one, noise wise not as quiet as A380 but I arrived not tired at all (15hr flight)>>><<<I found the engines to be very quiet, but the wing had a lot of aerodynamic noise (unless all wings are that loud and it's usually downed out by the engine).>>><<<Personally I did, but I can't say that everyone else would. Also, the larger Windows and newer interior are a big plus. >>><<<yeah 3-3-3, there are about 30+ business class seats, 2-2-2. Just got back from Tianjin, gotta say the 787 is pretty awesome. Cheap prices together with great service make for an excellent flight experience (even though meals are expensive).>>><<<Scoot Biz is 2-3-2 isn't it?>>><<<I don't think so.. I might be wrong though.

EDIT: I'm wrong >>><<<There are 35 ScootBiz seats on the Boeing 787-9 aircraft. The seats are black in colour, in 2-3-2 configuration, with 38" seat pitch.

It's not much of a story to be honest. Flew from taipei to tokyo. Uncomfortable seats, staff weren't great and the pre purchased food
That you can choose off a menu when you book online was horrid. I guess I just got off feeling pretty shit about the whole experience.. And I've flown with tiger.>>><<<Ouch. I won't even fly jetstar anymore....>>><<<&gt;  Uncomfortable seats, staff weren't great and the pre purchased food That you can choose off a menu when you book online was horrid.

Sounds much like my recent Qantas experiences (minus the paying for food).
