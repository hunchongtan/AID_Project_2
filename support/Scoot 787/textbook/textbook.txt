<<<The ability of companies to 'add value' to a product or manufactured goods is highly regarded throughout the world.>>>
<<<Within this context, aircraft manufacture and operation is regarded as a desirable commercial activity.>>>
<<<Many countries who previously were not involved in aeronautics are now moving into the business.>>>
<<<However, as aircraft are made technically more complex, involve increasing interdependence between component parts (airframe, engines and systems), and become more multi-national due to the large initial development costs, there is an increasing challenge to the industry.>>>
<<<The aircraft design team is in the forefront of this challenge.>>>
<<<Set against this scenario are the conflicts between the various objectives and requirements for new aircraft projects.>>>
<<<The designer is concerned about increasing performance and quality, meeting production deadlines, promoting total-life product support, and satisfying customer and infrastructure requirements.>>>
<<<Above all these aspects the designer is expected to meet established safety and environ- mental requirements and to anticipate the sociological and political impact of the design.>>>
<<<Balancing all these aspects within an acceptable cost and timescales is what makes aircraft design such a professionally challenging and ultimately satisfying activity.>>>
<<<One of the educational objectives of an aeronautical engineering curriculum is to introduce students to the procedures and practices of aircraft design as a means of illustrating the often conflicting requirements mentioned above.>>>
<<<This textbook describes the initial project stages of civil transport aircraft design as an example of such practices.>>>
<<<Obviously, the methods used have had to be simplified from industrial practice in order to match the knowledge, ability and timescales available to students.>>>
<<<However, this simplification is made in the level of special- isation and detail design and not in the fundamental principles.>>>
<<<An example of this approach is the substitution of general purpose spreadsheet methods in place of the specialist procedural-based mainframe programs commonly used for aircraft analysis in industry.>>>
<<<Apart from a general introduction to aircraft project design, this book provides an extension to the classical 'Flight Mechanics' courses.>>>
<<<It also bridges the gap between specialist lectures in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures and systems, and aircraft project coursework.>>>
<<<The scope of the book has purposely been limited to meet the objectives of undergraduate study.>>>
<<<In order to illustrate the basic principles, a simplified approach has had to be made.>>>
<<<Where appropriate, reference is made to other texts for more detailed study.>>>
<<<Some prior knowledge of conventional theories in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures and control is necessary but where possible the analysis presented in the book can be used without further study.>>>
<<<The terminology and the significance of various parameters is explained at the point of application and the main notation listed at the end of the book.>>>
<<<The book is arranged in two parts.>>>
<<<In Chapters 1-14 each of the significant influences on aircraft project design is described.>>>
<<<This part starts with a broad introduction to civil air transport, followed by a detailed description of the design process and a description of aircraft layout procedures.>>>
<<<The next set of chapters are concerned with detailed descriptions of the design methods and an introduction to the principal aircraft components.>>>
<<<The concluding chapters deal with the parametric methods used to refine the design configuration and a description of the formal presentation of the baseline design.>>>
<<<The second part of the book (Chapters 15-19) includes an introduction to the use of spreadsheet methods in aircraft design work and four separate design studies.>>>
<<<The studies illustrate the application of such spreadsheet methods.>>>
<<<Each study deals with a separate design topic.>>>
<<<The first shows how a simple design specification is taken through the complete design process.>>>
<<<As a contrast the second study deals with non-passenger aircraft design, considering a transport aircraft.>>>
<<<As both the previous studies deal with conventional configurations the third study shows how to assess unorthodox layouts.>>>
<<<Finally, the last design study shows how you may use the methods to analyse topics other than pure aircraft technical aspects.>>>
<<<No book alone will provide the key to good design.>>>
<<<You can only achieve this through the acquisition of knowledge, hard methodical work, broad experience on many different aircraft projects and an open and creative mind.>>>
<<<However, we hope that this book will eliminate some of the minor stumbling blocks that young engineers find annoying, confusing and time-wasting at the start of their design work.>>>
<<<Wherever possible System International (SI) units have been used.>>>
<<<However, in aeronautics several parameters continue to be used and quoted in non-SI units (for example altitude is normally in feet).>>>
<<<It is therefore necessary to have an understanding of different systems of units.>>>
<<<To allow conversion between different systems of units a conversion table offers help to both aspiring young designers and older engineers who struggle to convert their past experience into the new system of units.>>>
<<<Finally, it is impossible to make the book complete.>>>
<<<The contents and data do not cover all the aspects of civil transport design required by every user.>>>
<<<For example, we have not included anything on supersonic aircraft because it is still uncertain if we can solve the environmental problems (noise and emissions) associated with high and fast operations.>>>
<<<By the same token we have not gone too far on the inclusion of advanced technologies and materials.>>>
<<<Such developments will not affect the main design process and you could allow for them in future studies by establishing factors for use in the standard formulae (e.g.>>>
<<<mass and drag reduction factors).>>>
<<<However, allowing for these omissions, we have made a genuine attempt to produce a book that is a starting point for students who want to know more about the fascinating process of commercial turbofan aircraft design.>>>
<<<Acknowledgements In writing this book we have received a great deal of assistance from many individuals, institutions and companies who have given information, effort and encouragement to us.>>>

<<<Introduction On the third of May 1952 a De Havilland Comet 1 aircraft (Fig.>>>
<<<1.1) took off to inaugurate the world's first scheduled jet airline service.>>>
<<<This flight from London to Johannesburg was celebrated close to the fiftieth anniversary of the Wright brothers' historic first powered passenger-carrying flight and only 11 years after the first flight of the Whittle jet engine.>>>
<<<In the 40-plus years since the Comet flight, jet aircraft have established a dominant position in the civil air transport market and continue to show steady increase in numbers as demand for business, leisure and private flying continues to grow.>>>
<<<Since the end of the Second World War annual air transport passenger numbers have risen from about 18 million to over a billion in recent years.>>>
<<<This growth is expected to continue as more nations become industrialised and the world's population becomes more air-minded.>>>
<<<This demand for air travel establishes a Fig.>>>
<<<1.1 De Havilland Comet 1. requirement for more aircraft and a larger network of routes.>>>
<<<Commercial opportunities arise for both aircraft manufacturers and airlines to meet the expected market.>>>
<<<Estimating traffic growth To plan aircraft development programmes it is necessary to estimate future trends in air transport for both passenger and freight businesses.>>>
<<<The number of aircraft movements is mainly related to the demand for passenger travel.>>>
<<<Econometric analysis of historical data shows a strong correlation between world economic growth and the demand for air transport.>>>
<<<This confirms that an expansion in business travel and cargo transport are linked to growth in commercial and world trading activity.>>>
<<<The level of personal disposable income affects the demand for leisure travel.>>>
<<<The standard of service provided has a direct influence on the customer's motivation to travel.>>>
<<<All these issues are affected by such factors as the price of the air ticket, international currency exchange rates, availability and frequency of the service, expansion and development of routes and changes in the regulations governing airline operations.>>>
<<<World economic growth is measured by national and global gross national products (GNP).>>>
<<<Although the expansion in air transport generally follows the variation in GNP, it has consistently shown a much larger growth rate.>>>
<<<In the period 1960-1990 world GNP increased at an average annual rate of 3.8% in real terms whereas airline scheduled passenger traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles, RPM) increased at an annual rate of 9.5%.>>>
<<<Over this period the rate of growth of both GNP and RPM have progressively decreased.>>>
<<<In the last decade the average world GNP rose by only 2.4% and RPM by 5.7% per year.>>>
<<<Even at this lower rate air travel doubles in a 12-year period.>>>
<<<These high growth rates have resulted in congestion at the busiest airports and in the most frequently used flight corridors.>>>
<<<Apart from the capital required to purchase new aircraft to meet the demand, large investments are necessary in airports and the associated infra-structure to provide the service.>>>
<<<The resultant expansion at existing airports (increased length and number of runways and new terminal facilities) attracts environmental objections and inevitable political interference with the economic model.>>>
<<<These factors are difficult to predict and could have considerable effect on the natural expansion of traffic at the busiest city centre airports.>>>
<<<Technological developments in air transport management and aircraft design may be the only way that more serious environmental and political restrictions can be overcome.>>>
<<<Factors outside the control of the air transport industry have been shown to affect the national growth in traffic.>>>
<<<Sudden changes in fuel price by cartel trading was the cause of depression in demand for air travel in the mid to late 70s.>>>
<<<Political unrest, (e.g.>>>
<<<terrorism, or in extreme cases war) have always depressed air travel.>>>
<<<In the future, the market for air transport may be affected by the expansion of new communication and information technology systems (e.g.>>>
<<<tele-conferencing and the internet).>>>
<<<This may either depress travel by reducing the need for business trips, or stimulate the market by generating more trade and a stronger demand for Australia Canada UK USA Spain Holland France Germany Italy Japan a t i p a c r e p s p i r T New Zealand Malaysia Saudi Greece Korea South Africa Brazil Turkey Pakistan China India Fig.>>>
<<<1.2 Demand for air travel (source IMF).>>>
<<<GNP per capita holiday travel.>>>
<<<Such influences make forecasts based on historical analysis very suspect but the consistency of demand for air travel over the past 30 years gives reassurance that the effects tend to be self balancing.>>>
<<<The influence of national GNP values, and the resulting personal disposable income associated with this, is clearly illustrated by plotting the number of trips per capita against national GNP.>>>
<<<The distribution is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<1.2.>>>
<<<In developed countries the air transport market is regarded as mature with growth at about 3-4% per year.>>>
<<<The latent demand for air travel is seen in the developing and under-developed industrial countries.>>>
<<<The developing countries have air transport growth rates about double that of the developed countries.>>>
<<<The poorer countries need the stimulation of industrialisation to provide growth in air transport.>>>
<<<This is shown clearly in the potential for growth in China and in the countries of the original USSR.>>>
<<<The UK Office of Science and Technology in a 'Technology Forecast' in 1995 identified three main influences on the growth of air travel: • gross domestic product (GDP) • airfares • propensity to travel GDP is the dominant parameter and as such needs to be carefully considered in any forecast.>>>
<<<The current value of 3% may be varied by ±0.9% in a best and worst case scenario.>>>
<<<Air fares have historically reduced due largely to competitive trading and economies of scale but the future is somewhat confused as airline bankruptcies and amalgamations reduce the number of operators.>>>
<<<Fares are also affected by the cost of fuel which may vary in the future due to changes in production rates and the addition of environmental taxes (e.g.>>>
<<<carbon tax).>>>
<<<All these effects need to be reflected in the methods used for forecasting.>>>
<<<The economic modelling of demand for air transport is based on the following two models.>>>
<<<(PK) = a - (GDPf • (PRf (FTK) = d • (EX)e • (FR)f where: (FTK) = freight tonne-kilometres (EX) — world exports (PK) — passenger-kilometres (GDP) = gross domestic product (PR) = passenger revenue per unit (PK) (FR) = freight revenue per unit (FTK) Historical analysis provides values for the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f. As passenger demand increases airlines can respond by scheduling extra flights, by using larger aircraft, or by increasing passenger load factors.>>>
<<<The linking of passenger- kilometres to aircraft-kilometres involves estimates of passenger load factor (i.e.>>>
<<<the ratio of the number of seats filled to the total available) and aircraft size.>>>
<<<The following relationships apply: aircraft-kilometres = (passenger-kilometres)/(passenger load factor) where: passenger load factor = (passenger-kilometres)/(seat-kilometres) and aircraft size = (seat-kilometres)/(aircraft-kilometres) The historical trends in passenger load factor and aircraft size are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<1.3.>>>
<<<It can be seen that since the early 80s both aircraft size and passenger load factor have increased only modestly.>>>
<<<This effect may have resulted from the introduction of several new medium-sized aircraft into the market at this time and the expansion of airlines due to deregulation.>>>
<<<As a result, the number of city pairs linked by scheduled services nearly doubled in this period.>>>
<<<These factors are likely to continue into the near future but may be curtailed by restrictions in air movement growth at some airports due to congestion.>>>
<<<Overcoming the operational problems at airports during busy times of the day has been cited as the main reason to develop new larger aircraft to meet future traffic growth.>>>

<<<An estimate by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) made in 1992 predicted average aircraft size to rise from 183 seats in 1990 to 220 in 2001.>>>
<<<Airport planning demands a knowledge of the number of aircraft departures.>>>
<<<Aircraft stage length links aircraft departures to aircraft-kilometres: aircraft departures = (aircraft-km)/(stage length) where: stage length —(aircraft-km)/(aircraft departures).>>>
<<<The historical trend in average stage length is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<1.4.>>>
<<<In the past 20 years the growth in average stage length has been between 1 and 2% per annum.>>>
<<<The figure above shows that the largest growth has been in the long-haul routes.>>>
<<<This has been made possible mainly by the increased range capability of new aircraft types and the development of new markets, particularly in the Pacific region.>>>
<<<This trend is expected to continue and result in annual growth of 1% in average stage length.>>>
<<<Forecasting growth can be achieved by considering the average annual rates of change in each of the main variables: % (aircraft-km) = % (passenger-km) — % (load factor) — % (average size) % (departures) = % (aircraft-km) — % (stage length) ICAO made the following predictions in 1992 (Table 1.1).>>>
<<<The world's commercial activity associated with aerospace is huge (amounting to over $100B in the mid-90s).>>>
<<<This is shared almost equally between companies specialising in airframes, engines, airframe systems, airport systems and airport facility.>>>
<<<There are currently about 350000 civil aircraft registered in the world but most of these are in the light /personal aircraft category.>>>

<<<Over the past few years this fierce competition has resulted in reduced revenue and poor commercial returns for some airlines.>>>
<<<If a more commercially sensible trading environment is adopted in the future this may result in more expensive airfares which in turn will reduce demand and therefore the potential revenue.>>>
<<<This dilemma illustrates the precarious nature of airline business.>>>
<<<Modal choice The travelling public has available a wide choice of modes of transport including car, bus, train, ship and aircraft.>>>
<<<By far the most significant advantage of air travel is the time saved by the fast cruising speed.>>>
<<<Professor Bouladon of the Geneva Institute aptly described this in his analysis of transport gaps in 1967.>>>
<<<The total trip time shown in Fig.>>>
<<<1.7 is a combination of delay caused by the infrequency of the service, the speed of travel and the wasted time due to the interconnection of services.>>>
<<<With only minor alterations his hypothesis remains valid today.>>>
<<<Of the three 'gaps' identified, the short- and long-haul ones are directly targeted by the air transport industry.>>>
<<<Reducing each of the component times contributing to the overall trip time presents opportunities for both operational and technical improvements in new air transport and continues to challenge aircraft designers, airline managers and airport operators.>>>
<<<For short stages it is no longer acceptable to have long reporting times prior to boarding.>>>
<<<The most successful local air services attempt to copy bus and train operations in which tickets are bought at the boarding gate at the time of embarking.>>>
<<<For longer journeys the pre-loading of luggage and cabin supplies means that earlier reporting is necessary.>>>

<<<1.8 Modal traffic split (source Airbus).>>>
<<<Journey distance (km) The influence of time saving is shown by the modal split (for business travel) between the three major transport forms of travel (Fig.>>>
<<<1.8).>>>
<<<As we all know, for shorter journeys and where a suitable public transport system is not available the private car is the natural choice of travel.>>>
<<<For journeys less than 400 km/250 miles the car is the dominant mode of transport.>>>
<<<In this market the train and bus are seen to be disadvantaged by the infrequency of service, by the out-of-pocket cost and the slow journey times (especially for distances greater than 250 km/150 miles.>>>
<<<As public transport services are devel- oped into a frequent, fast and comfortable option (e.g.>>>
<<<by the introduction of high speed trains), the competition to air becomes stronger in the mid-range, (250- 600 km/150-350 miles).>>>
<<<Over about 600 km/350 miles the time saving of air travel becomes attractive and air dominates the market.>>>
<<<As shown by Bouladon, the total journey time is affected by delays and transfers between modes.>>>
<<<The links to the airport (road, rail and public services) is a major influence on the success of the service.>>>
<<<For leisure travel the choice of mode is strongly influenced by ticket price and airport convenience.>>>
<<<This has led to the development of the non-scheduled/ charter air transport sector.>>>
<<<As personal disposable income increases and more holiday resorts are developed this sector will become increasingly significant.>>>
<<<The aircraft market Traffic growth and modal split are the major factors in the demand for new aircraft but these are not the only parameters.>>>
<<<Aircraft have only a finite life and this means that there is a considerable market for replacements.>>>
<<<It is estimated that only about 60% of the total new aircraft will be required to meet the expected increase in traffic.>>>
<<<The rest will be needed to replace existing aircraft which have reached the end of their useful life.>>>
<<<Some of the replacement aircraft will be  introduced because of environmental and regulatory changes (e.g.>>>
<<<older types not meeting local noise regulations) and others will be needed to replace aircraft which are less efficient and more costly to operate than new types.>>>
<<<The number of aircraft required is also affected by the trend to larger aircraft, longer-range non-stop flights, and the passenger's preference for the wide-body configuration.>>>
<<<In the next 20 years it is estimated that about 13 500 new aircraft will be needed to match the increase in demand for air travel and to replace older types.>>>
<<<More than half of these aircraft will be sized at less than 200 seats.>>>
<<<This represents between $B950 and $B1500 turnover to cover the purchase of new equipment and the associated after-sales trade.>>>
<<<As the economies of the developing countries grow, new manufacturing companies will be attracted to the civil aircraft market opportunities.>>>
<<<It is likely that these new companies will be started as new joint ventures with established aircraft manufacturers.>>>
<<<The number of competing companies may therefore increase, adding further commercial pressure to the current manufacturing industry.>>>
<<<The market for new aircraft is dominated by very few airlines.>>>
<<<About 50% of all turbofan airliners are held by only 18 airlines.>>>
<<<The top 100 airlines operate 81% of all jet airliners.>>>
<<<This centralisation may change in the future due to trade and traffic liberalisation and the resulting challenges to existing monopolistic business practices.>>>
<<<Although aircraft design deals mainly with the technical/engineering aspects it must be remembered that many non-technical influences are important.>>>
<<<It is necessary to understand these influences at the onset of the design so that they can be fully considered and due allowance be given to them in the development of the aircraft specification.>>>
<<<For example, analysis of demand for civil aircraft shows how the air transport sector is only one option available to the travelling public.>>>
<<<For most journeys a mixture of transport modes is necessary; therefore each mode is not independent.>>>
<<<Within this context the availability, cost and efficiency of the road and rail networks to and from an airport are known to be major components in the choice of air travel.>>>
<<<The increase in demand for air travel will lead to more aircraft movements.>>>
<<<This will result in higher aircraft utilisation and the requirement for more aircraft to be produced.>>>
<<<The operational problems from such developments are now becoming a major concern.>>>
<<<Congestion at airports and in the main air routes, environmental damage and the consumption of scarce resources will increasingly be factors to be considered by the designers and operators.>>>
<<<The commercial transport market may be roughly divided into four sections depending on aircraft size and capability (large, wide-bodied, narrow-bodied and regional).>>>
<<<The largest aircraft (often referred to as jumbos) are wide-bodied multi- deck configurations of which the Boeing 747 is typical.>>>
<<<Passenger capacities exceeding 400 with range capability exceeding 7000 nm and take-off length of about 11 000 ft are typical.>>>
<<<With the expected growth in passenger traffic and the shortage of available take-off slots at convenient times there is a renewed interest in expanding the large aircraft sector.>>>
<<<Competitors to the B747 will include new super-jumbos (new large aircraft) with passenger capacity between 500 and 700 with a range of 7500 nm.>>>
<<<The next largest sector includes wide-bodied turbofan aircraft which are smaller than the jumbos.>>>
<<<These have capacities between 200 and 400 passengers and a range capability of over 6000 nm.>>>
<<<It is this sector that has seen most competition over the past decade with Airbus, Boeing and the original McDonnell-Douglas companies offering a range of aircraft types to the airlines.>>>
<<<The narrow-body sector includes aircraft with capacities from about 100 to just under 200 passengers, flying up to 5000 nm but aimed mainly at the 2000-3000 nm maximum stage length market.>>>
<<<Several smaller aircraft manufacturers have aircraft types to compete with the big manufacturers but the market is mainly satisfied by Airbus and Boeing types.>>>
<<<The smallest commercial aircraft sector is referred to as the 'regionals' with passenger capacities ranging from 30 to 100 and a maximum range of typically 1500nm.>>>
<<<This sector is dominated by turbopropeller types which are speed limited due to propeller noise and aerodynamic factors.>>>
<<<To offset the disadvantage caused by the slow speed (increased travel time) several aircraft manufacturers have introduced small turbofan-powered designs with capacity starting at 50 seats.>>>
<<<The '-jet versus -prop' issue is one which will continue to dominate the top end of the regional sector.>>>
<<<The increased speed and comfort of the jet types are likely to win market share in the higher capacity, longer range part of the sector.>>>
<<<The commercial transport market is now experiencing the development of a fifth sector, namely 'air freight/cargo'.>>>
<<<The development of several world-wide parcel companies offering fast and secure delivery of mail, high value commodities and perishable goods has led to the conversion of passenger transport aircraft for freight or combined freight/passenger (known as 'combi') configurations.>>>
<<<The freight sector covers each of the traditional sectors mentioned above with freight capacities of over 70 tonnes, 35-70 tonnes, 30-60 tonnes and below 30 tonnes respectively for each of the four sectors.>>>
<<<The influence of the freight operations on airport movements (many during the night) can be seen by the ranking of the busiest airports (see Data C).>>>
<<<The main freight /cargo 'hub' airports now figure in the most active sites.>>>
<<<Most manufacturers of new aircraft will now offer freight and combi versions of their passenger aircraft.>>>
<<<Some interest also exists in the conversion of military transport aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<C-17, An 124) into civil freighters.>>>
<<<Business jets present yet another departure from the four market sectors of commercial transport described above.>>>
<<<These aircraft are generally small (maximum 12 seats) but may have long range capabilities with reduced occupancy.>>>
<<<This sector is a specialised part of the aircraft market which, although using similar techniques and methods to the larger aircraft, is not covered in this book.>>>
<<<However, the methods and data described can be adapted to assist in the preliminary design of such aircraft for student work.>>>
<<<Civil aircraft design to meet the market described above is clearly a challenging occupation which involves a unique mixture of technical excellence, engineering management and business acumen.>>>
<<<In an ever changing social and political environment aeronautical engineering design presents opportunities to use the experience and skills associated with advanced technologies to produce new aircraft designs.>>>
<<<The following chapters offer a background to these possibilities and show how preliminary design studies are undertaken.>>>
<<<Project design process Objectives Aircraft design is a compromise between many competing factors and constraints.>>>
<<<It is important to recognise these and to understand the influence of each on the aircraft configuration.>>>
<<<This chapter describes the process by which the design is conceived to meet the many constraints and regulations that exist.>>>
<<<Such a process involves the coordination of many different specialist departments.>>>
<<<Each of these work on the overall design but have a divided responsibility between the effectiveness of the aircraft and the professional objectives of their speciality.>>>
<<<It is necessary to understand the way in which each of the main departments interacts on the definition of the design.>>>
<<<Some of the subsequent chapters in this book show the detailed estimations that are made in the early stages of this process (e.g.>>>
<<<mass estimations, aerodynamic assessments and performance predictions).>>>
<<<The specialist departments provide the input data to the technical and economic evaluators (sometimes called project managers).>>>
<<<These designers coordinate a systematic search to find the 'optimum' configuration and settle disputes between conflicting specialist opinions.>>>
<<<Understanding the conflicting pressures placed on the overall design will allow you to appreciate the process and to take such influences into account when conducting your own studies.>>>
<<<After reading this chapter you will be aware of the organisational framework in which the aircraft is designed and the compromises that have to be taken into account to reach a sensible and acceptable layout.>>>
<<<It has been said, ungenerously, that a camel is a horse designed by a committee - it is the job of the project designer/manager to avoid the aircraft turning out like a camel unless the main requirement is to travel for days across a desert without water supplies!>>>
<<<Project design The project design process is the means by which the competing factors and constraints which affect the design are synthesised with the specialist analytical inputs to produce the overall configuration.>>>
<<<The process may be considered in three different parts: • conceptual design studies • preliminary design studies • detail design studies The distinction between the second and third parts is somewhat blurred due to the individualistic definition of level of detail design in the project stage.>>>
<<<The two parts are sometimes linked and termed the 'preliminary design phase'.>>>
<<<The project design activity ends when the configuration is 'frozen' and a decision is taken to proceed to the 'detail design phase'.>>>
<<<It is in this phase that detailed component geometry is specified and the manufacturing processes planned.>>>
<<<The project design phase is followed by the detail design and manufacturing phases.>>>
<<<During the detail design phase all the significant technical decisions are finalised and the aircraft committed to production.>>>
<<<Throughout the activity, drawings are progressively released for production.>>>
<<<At the beginning of the manufacturing phase some parts are built for test purposes and the first complete aircraft is used for the initial flight tests.>>>
<<<After all the tests have been completed the aircraft type will be granted a Certificate of Airworthiness by the national (or federal) aviation authority.>>>
<<<The aircraft type can then be introduced into airline service.>>>
<<<Figure 2.1 shows how the design and manufacturing activities are scheduled.>>>
<<<Note how the various phases are not sequential but tend to overlap.>>>
<<<The curved arrow shows the build-up of cost expended in the project.>>>
<<<The importance of the project design phase is shown by this cost escalation line.>>>
<<<Less than 3% of the total Project design Detail design Conceptual phase Project studies start Preliminary design phase Configuration fixed Detail design phase Drawings released for manufacture Manufacture Testing Cost escalation Fig.>>>
<<<2.1 Design and manufacturing schedule.>>>
<<<pre-production cost is attributable to the project design activity yet it is in this period that irrevocable decisions on the design of aircraft are taken.>>>
<<<Modifications to the basic configuration after this period are difficult and costly, making it necessary to 'get the aircraft right'.>>>
<<<This places a large responsibility on the project design team.>>>
<<<To this end, they need to understand not only the detail design, manufacturing process and operation of the proposed design but also the sensitivity of the design to possible future changes.>>>
<<<This makes it necessary to analyse many variants of the aircraft around a selected preferred (baseline) design.>>>
<<<Computerised methods of analysis are currently used to conduct these studies which are sometimes inappropriately called 'optimised designs'.>>>
<<<Conceptual design studies The first activity in the project design process is the 'conceptual design study'.>>>
<<<In this phase, conventional and novel configurations are considered to determine layouts which are technically feasible and commercially viable.>>>
<<<At the start of the phase all options are considered.>>>
<<<For example, the aircraft overall geometrical configuration, the engine (type, number and position), the internal cabin arrangements, the aircraft systems and control, manufacturing methods and materials, the level of advanced technology to be included and the overall operational procedures are all to be decided.>>>
<<<Each choice needs to be investigated as completely as the level of detail and time that is available will allow.>>>
<<<It may be necessary to conduct research studies into some of the novel concepts and technologies to quantify the effectiveness of the idea on the aircraft layout.>>>
<<<In some of the research areas it will not be possible to quantify the effectiveness with reasonable accuracy and an intelligent 'guesstimate' will be required.>>>
<<<During the concept design phase the quantity of data generated on each design will be relatively limited and the manpower expended small.>>>
<<<The outcome of the study is a knowledge of the feasibility of the various concepts and an estimate of the rough size of the most likely configurations.>>>
<<<A detailed analysis of each design at this stage is not possible and may be of limited value as most of the concepts will be discarded.>>>
<<<For conventional layouts and for developments of existing aircraft, experience from previous designs (and competitor aircraft) will provide a good approximation to the aircraft size.>>>
<<<If the layout is novel then available methods which have been developed from conventional designs will give only crude approximations.>>>
<<<In these cases it is necessary to develop new assessment models.>>>
<<<Throughout the project phase all the models will be improved and refined to reduce the technical and commercial risks associated with the novel layouts and technologies.>>>
<<<Preliminary design studies At the end of the conceptual design phase all the design layouts will have been analysed.>>>
<<<Those which were regarded as unfeasible or too commercially risky will be eliminated.>>>
<<<The remainder will be compared after careful consideration of a suitable selection criterion.>>>
<<<The 'best' one, or possibly two, designs will be identified and taken into the preliminary design phase.>>>
<<<It is important not to carry too many options forward to the next stage as this will dissipate the available effort and slow down the detailed definition of the preferred design.>>>
<<<However, care must be taken to avoid discarding design layouts too quickly as some may lead to evolutionary configurations which could give the aircraft a competitive advantage over aircraft from other companies.>>>
<<<In the preliminary design phase the preferred configuration(s) from the conceptual study is subjected to a more rigorous technical analysis.>>>
<<<The objective of this phase is to find the best ('optimum') geometry for the aircraft with regard to the commercial prospects and in comparison with competitor aircraft.>>>
<<<All the principal aircraft parameters are considered to be variable during this analysis.>>>
<<<This allows sensitivity analyses to be conducted.>>>
<<<It is common practice to establish a 'baseline' configuration and to perform a series of parametric studies around this layout.>>>
<<<These parametric studies are done in parallel with the development of the baseline design but must be performed quickly enough to allow any desirable changes to the layout to be made before the design is 'frozen'.>>>
<<<It is therefore necessary to conduct such studies at a level of detail that will provide quick but reasonably accurate answers.>>>
<<<At the same time as the parametric studies are being considered the design team will analyse competitive aircraft, perform trade-off studies in detailed technical areas, and test the sensitivity of the baseline design to changes in the constraints imposed by the specification.>>>
<<<Again, many of these studies are done at a level of detail that produces quick results which are reasonably accurate.>>>
<<<Detail design studies The detail design phase is started towards the end of the parametric analysis.>>>
<<<In this part of the design process the layout is refined to a greater level of detail.>>>
<<<With the external shape fixed, the structural framework will be defined.>>>
<<<In areas of doubt, the theoretical calculations will be done in finer detail and validated by component tests.>>>
<<<In this phase there will be an increasing reluctance to make radical geometric changes to the overall layout of the aircraft as this may invalidate work done on the baseline configuration by other departments.>>>
<<<Detailed optimisation studies will be limited to parts which will not affect the overall configuration of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Throughout this phase the aircraft weight and performance estimates will be continuously updated as more details of the aircraft layout become available.>>>
<<<At the end of this phase the aircraft is 'released for production'.>>>
<<<The design process Each part of the process is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<2.2 and briefly described in the following sections.>>>
<<<Initiation of the project Customer requirements : Product development Market exploitation : New technology Innovation Requirements and Regulations Market and mission Payload Range Speed Field Costs Environmental Noise Emissions Fuel use Airfield Compatibilities Airworthiness Flight envelopes Handling and control Structural integrity Systems integrity Serviceability Initial aircraft specification Engine options Aircraft concepts Selection of baseline configuration Baseline design evaluations Payload / range Mass / balance Structural framework Lift / drag estimation Performance prediction Stability / control Parametric design studies Market evaluation Cost analysis Sensitivities Tradeoffs Competitors 'Optimum' configuration Pass to detail design phase Prepare type record Fig.>>>
<<<2.2 Project design process.>>>
<<<Initiation The start of the design process requires the recognition of a 'need'.>>>
<<<This may come from established or potential customers, an analysis of the market and the trends for demands, the development of an existing product line (e.g.>>>
<<<aircraft stretch), the introduction and exploitation of new technologies (e.g.>>>
<<<composite structures) and products (e.g.>>>
<<<new engines) and the application of innovation in research and development (e.g.>>>
<<<laminar flow).>>>
<<<For any of these possibilities it is necessary to fully understand the factors which will affect the design.>>>
<<<For each new design the relative significance of the various features will be unique.>>>
<<<It is essential that the most influential features are identified and understood.>>>
<<<From such investigations it is possible to clearly state the specification that will have to be met by the design.>>>
<<<This must contain clear and unambiguous statements which can be quantified, or at least form the basis on which decisions can be taken in the design management process.>>>
<<<Specification During the early part of the project design phase, one of the main tasks is to clarify and test the specification upon which all later stages of the design process will be based.>>>
<<<Identifying the role (or roles) of the aircraft in terms of the required performance and payload are the first considerations.>>>
<<<In the early stages the aircraft specification cannot be rigidly set out; it is therefore necessary to investigate the effect of changes to the requirements.>>>
<<<The preliminary design studies may be used to provide evidence on which to base decisions on aircraft role and performance.>>>
<<<In some cases the specification will be more tightly set by the customer and as a result the design process can be started earlier.>>>
<<<Having obtained the specification for the aircraft but before getting too involved with the technical design, it is necessary to define the criteria to be used in making design decisions on various options.>>>
<<<Criteria If the designers, manufacturers and customers can agree how to assess the effectiveness of an aircraft, the design team will have an easier task.>>>
<<<Even if no agreement is possible the designers will need to define the criterion or criteria on which to judge competing designs.>>>
<<<It is important that this definition is done carefully as it will be used throughout the whole design process as the standard on which to make design decisions.>>>
<<<The most sensible criterion for any company to use is 'return on investment'.>>>
<<<Equally, the purchaser will use a similar criterion when comparing competing products.>>>
<<<Hence this criterion will affect the sales potential of the aircraft and thereby the aircraft manufacturer's criterion.>>>
<<<Unfortunately 'return on investment' is not the only criterion to be considered by the purchaser and producer of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Political, economic, technological and sociological (environmental) aspects must also be considered when analysing the design but at the early design stage there will be insufficient knowledge of the future situation to make accurate prediction of the effects of these on the aircraft design.>>>
<<<Also a generalised return on investment criterion is difficult to model due to the variability of economic performance of different airlines and manufacturing companies.>>>
<<<In the past, this had led the design team to adopt a simpler alternative criterion.>>>
<<<Up to about the mid-50s the only criterion which could be easily quantified was weight (e.g.>>>
<<<minimum all-up weight or minimum zero-fuel weight) or performance criteria (e.g.>>>
<<<minimum drag, maximum speed).>>>
<<<With the introduction of standardised cost methods (e.g.>>>
<<<Association of European Airlines-Direct Operating Cost Method) it was possible to consider non-weight/performance aspects in the design (e.g.>>>
<<<maintenance costs, crew salaries, depreciation, finance, etc.)>>>
<<<Nowadays the development of computer methods in project design permits a more complex multi-parameter criterion to be investigated.>>>
<<<Such computer models are only applicable to the early stages of project work.>>>
<<<As the design studies become more detailed the traditional criterion of minimum weight is still used in conjunction with a knowledge of operating, manufacturing and material costs.>>>
<<<Over the past few years some effort has been concentrated on cost elimination by the introduction of 'value analysis' in the detail design stages.>>>
<<<Consideration is now given to the 'whole life' costing process which includes operational aspects not covered in the direct operating cost models (e.g.>>>
<<<fleet mix and aircraft and engine spares commonality).>>>
<<<This may lead to the consideration of a 'family' approach to aircraft development in which similar aircraft layouts (airframe, engines and systems) are aimed at different pay load/ range specifications.>>>
<<<Constraints Each of the proposed layouts will be subject to a number of active design constraints.>>>
<<<These may arise from airworthiness requirements (e.g.>>>
<<<second segment climb gradients), performance specifications (e.g.>>>
<<<take-off field length), operational parameters (e.g.>>>
<<<turn-round time), or be imposed from external influences (e.g.>>>
<<<environmental noise rules).>>>
<<<There will also be a number of constraints set by the design/manufacturing management team.>>>
<<<These may include the definition of available materials and manufacturing methods, limits to the inclusion of advanced technologies, the exploitation of aerodynamic and structural innovations and the specification of particular components (e.g.>>>
<<<engines and avionics).>>>
<<<These constraints may be regarded as defining the technical and commercial risk that the company is prepared to accept in the new design.>>>
<<<It must be appreciated that it is possible to impose so many constraints to the design that a feasible solution does not exist.>>>
<<<Also, the inclusion of unnecessary, or over-stringent constraints will inevitably lead to commercial penalties on the design.>>>
<<<One of the main studies to be undertaken in the project design phase is to assess the sensitivity of all of the design constraints.>>>
<<<Those which are shown to be most critical to the effectiveness of the aircraft will be carefully re-assessed to try to minimise the influence of the constraints on the overall design.>>>
<<<Defining the aircraft specification, determining the criteria to be used for judging the aircraft effectiveness, and setting the constraints, represent a substantial tech- nical and managerial effort which must be undertaken prior to the start of any design work.>>>
<<<If any of these areas is not considered carefully the final aircraft design may be commercially flawed.>>>
<<<The reason for many of the past failures in aircraft design can be traced to a poor understanding of one or more of these basic factors.>>>

<<<Project management Technical and economic evaluations Fig.>>>
<<<2.3 Project management.>>>
<<<Project analysis With several, but not enough, highly inter-related equations governing the design of the aircraft it is not surprising that an iterative approach is the traditional method of conducting the initial project design process.>>>
<<<Initial 'guesses' based upon past experience or on data from similar types of aircraft form the starting point for the analysis.>>>
<<<The iterative process progressively determines more accurate and 'acceptable' output which refines the design.>>>
<<<The iterations are performed within specialisations but are all integrated through the aircraft configuration and performance analysis.>>>
<<<Before considering each of the main specialisations in the design process it is worth seeing how each is inter-related into the total design activity.>>>
<<<Figure 2.3 illustrates the way in which data, or information, is passed between specialist groups during the design process.>>>
<<<The main technologies are linked to the configuration design via the evaluation of the aircraft performance and economics.>>>
<<<It is within this evaluation process that checks are made on the aircraft constraints and the overall criterion (sometimes called the objectives function) is determined.>>>
<<<The specialist groups must consider the level of 'advanced technology' to be adopted (e.g.>>>
<<<the use of new materials, micro-minimisation of systems, aerodynamic features, aerofoil and control innovations) together with all the other active constraints on the design.>>>
<<<The data flow lines shown in the diagram are specific and indicate how the technology areas influence the configuration of the aircraft through the economic and performance evaluation.>>>
<<<The diagram shows clearly that the design process is not a single-step sequential process.>>>
<<<It is a cyclic process without a natural starting position.>>>
<<<Design solutions can only be achieved by an iterative process.>>>
<<<Experience suggests that the best way of starting the process is to make an estimate of the configuration and use this 'cock-shy' to make the detailed estimation in each of the technological areas.>>>
<<<Previous analysis methods suggest that the equations governing the design are reasonably well behaved and will rapidly converge to a feasible solution (if one exists).>>>
<<<Obviously, the closer the initial guess is to the final design configuration, the quicker will be the convergence to the best feasible design.>>>
<<<As a guide to the selection of the initial configuration it is useful to analyse previous aircraft designs of similar specification, preferably using statistical correlations on the main parameters.>>>
<<<This avoids introducing unwanted personal preferences into the choice of aircraft parameters.>>>
<<<Each of the specialist areas will now be described starting with the three principal sections (i.e.>>>
<<<aerodynamics, propulsion and weights).>>>
<<<The original cartoons in this section have been variously attributed to Bruhn and Miller in the early 'forties but their sentiments still have relevance over fifty years later!>>>
<<<Aerodynamics The aerodynamicist's dream is of a super-smooth streamlined aircraft in which the wing forms the principal feature (Fig.>>>
<<<2.4).>>>
<<<The fuselage, engines and undercarriage are all regarded as inconveniences which reduce aerodynamic efficiency.>>>
<<<The aerodynamics office data flow is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<2.5.>>>
<<<The fundamental technologies are contained in the upper left-hand box.>>>
<<<These are based on the theories and methods covered in textbooks on aerodynamics, on empirical data from past designs, from wind tunnel tests, or by computational fluid dynamic analysis.>>>
<<<Input data is shown in the upper right-hand box.>>>
<<<This comes mainly from the configuration group which provides the geometry of the aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<cabin size).>>>
<<<The improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, by controlling the profile shapes and integration of components, is the main objective for the aerodynamicists.>>>
<<<For a given technology level, the geometric description of the wing, tail and fuselage is determined.>>>
<<<Conflicting requirements from different mission stages must be resolved by the specification of compromised layouts (e.g.>>>

<<<Output from the aerodynamic analysis is fed as geometrical data to the configuration and weight sections and as aerodynamic functions/charts to the performance group (e.g.>>>

<<<Propulsion The engine experts see the aircraft as a means of carrying their masterpiece (Fig.>>>

<<<The data flow follows a similar pattern to the aerodynamics office and is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<2.7.>>>
<<<The enabling technology is shown in the left-hand box.>>>
<<<This is associated with accepted theories, methods and data from engine tests.>>>
<<<The technology level to be adopted is of particular concern to the engine designers because the choice may adversely affect engine reliability and maintenance costs.>>>
<<<Much will be expected by the airframe manufacturer from engine improvements as these will directly influence the operational effectiveness of the aircraft (fuel-use, noise levels, emissions and engine life).>>>
<<<Commercially binding assurances will be required by the aircraft manufacturing and airline companies with regard to the minimum engine performance.>>>
<<<Input data to the propulsion group (shown in the right-hand box) includes nacelle geometry, operating conditions, engine thrust de-rates, power off-takes, etc.>>>
<<<Output from the propulsion analysis is fed as geometry and weight data to the configuration and weight groups, and as performance data (fuel flow/thrust charts, power off-takes) to the performance section.>>>

<<<The designer has three choices with regard to the engines to be specified: • to use a current or proposed up-rated existing engine; • to use a new engine which will be available in the same timeframe as the aircraft project; • to use a hypothetical 'scaled' (rubber) engine based on a proposed new design.>>>
<<<The aircraft designer will be reluctant to exclusively specify an engine from one manufacturer.>>>
<<<They would prefer to be in the stronger commercial position of specifying a range of engines from competing manufacturers.>>>
<<<This may lead to the duplication of work for different engine types.>>>
<<<The choice between new and existing engines presents a difficult decision.>>>
<<<The potential advantages of a new product with improved technology levels are set against the risk of technical problems which may delay or even penalise the aircraft efficiency.>>>
<<<Project studies with theoretical 'rubber' engines are sometimes used to identify the best choice of engine type and performance.>>>
<<<The installation of the engines on the aircraft offers a difficult decision for the configuration designer.>>>
<<<How many engines should be used (2, 3 or 4)?>>>
<<<Should the engines be wing or fuselage mounted?>>>
<<<Should they be podded or buried?>>>
<<<What type (turboprop, propfan or turbofan)?>>>
<<<Such decisions will impact directly on the success or otherwise of the whole project.>>>
<<<Weights The weight engineers are always fighting a battle against increased weight from the technical and design offices.>>>
<<<The weight engineers' dream aircraft would be made as small as possible and would resemble a light model aircraft structure (Fig.>>>

<<<The data flow for this section is seen to be more complex than for the previous two specialisations (Fig.>>>

<<<Therefore the group constantly predicts the aircraft weight.>>>
<<<This acts as a barometer of potential aircraft performance problems.>>>
<<<If weight growth is detected weight saving programmes will be instigated.>>>
<<<There are several other technical departments involved in the design process including the control and structures groups.>>>
<<<Control group The flight control group have a difficult job.>>>
<<<They are asked to predict the flying qualities of the aircraft, sometimes before the true shape is finalised.>>>
<<<They would see their dream aircraft as one in which several interchangeable surfaces are available for different flight conditions and designs, or in which the control surfaces are so large they will not risk any unknown instability (Fig.>>>
<<<2.10).>>>
<<<The data flow in this department is similar to that of the aerodynamicists with whom they work closely (Fig.>>>
<<<2.11).>>>
<<<The basic concepts on which the analysis is based concern the stability and control (handling) assessment and system analysis.>>>
<<<The technology level has been substantially affected by modern computer technology (flight management systems), transmission (fly by light), and information display ('glass' cockpits, new system design, lasers, synthetic vision, etc.).>>>

<<<2.13 The structures office.>>>
<<<The structural analysis of the aircraft represents another major technological section in the design organisation.>>>
<<<Assurance of the airworthiness of the aircraft in terms of strength and stiffness is their main area of responsibility.>>>
<<<The structural strength (stressing) and stiffness (aeroelasticity) of the aircraft are related to other technical areas (aerodynamics, propulsion and flight control as shown above).>>>
<<<The fundamental concepts on which the analysis is based include structural analysis methods, structural testing, material properties and manufacturing methods.>>>
<<<The geometric and weight groups provide the input to the analysis in terms of shape, size and masses.>>>
<<<Aerodynamic loads are either determined by the aerodynamics department or by a specialised loading group.>>>
<<<Output to the configuration and weight groups consists of the geometry of the structural framework, material specifications and constructional details.>>>
<<<Computer-aided design and concurrent engineering The advent of computer-aided drawing (CAD) programs and their universal adoption in the manufacturing industry has led to the ability of each technical department to access the current aircraft geometrical definition.>>>
<<<This ability allows each department to be working on the design concurrently.>>>
<<<This reduces the time necessary to analyse and develop the design compared to the older methods which relied on a sequencing of the different specialist departments.>>>
<<<The process also allows more detailed investigations to be conducted on the design at the early stages, for example structural finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics and dynamic flight simulation are performed in the knowledge of the same aircraft layout.>>>
<<<The integration of the aircraft design process requires careful management of the computer information system to avoid the use of different standards yet to allow changes to be incorporated as the design develops.>>>
<<<The aircraft project manager has to control the total system design.>>>
<<<This requires different knowledge and skills to that of the traditional chief designer.>>>
<<<Several different software suites have been developed to meet the requirements of 'computer-aided design'.>>>
<<<Each of the major manufacturing companies has incorporated a specific CAD system which it standardises for use in all the sections of the company; and they require subcontractors to be able to use a similar system.>>>
<<<The new design and development process has become known as concurrent engineering to represent the total integration of all the technical departments working on the aircraft project at the same time.>>>
<<<Configuration and performance/economic aspects To understand the 'configurationaP and 'performance and economic' analysis work it is necessary to study the individual aspects of aircraft design in more detail.>>>
<<<The following chapters in this book are intended to give an introduction to each of these topics.>>>
<<<These concentrate on the aeronautical engineering aspects (con- figuration, design, performance, etc.)>>>
<<<but some important influences have had to be put into the background.>>>
<<<Such aspects include aircraft and engine manufacturing processes, maintenance and reliability, operational and environmental features, social and political issues.>>>
<<<Although it has not been possible to cover these aspects, designers must be aware of them as they may be critical to decisions made during the project development phase.>>>
<<<Overall configuration and systems Objectives This chapter describes how the overall configuration of the aircraft is decided from the many options available to the designers.>>>
<<<From a brief historical perspective the chapter then looks at the unconventional layouts that have been considered in the recent past.>>>
<<<Although these have not yet found favour with designers it is worth keeping them in mind as conditions and constraints may change in the future.>>>
<<<Such changes could make current layouts less attractive or even not feasible.>>>
<<<New designers should start a new project with a completely open mind and this means a careful consideration of all configurations particularly in a historical context.>>>
<<<Conventional layouts The development of civil jet transport configurations has largely been an evolutionary process.>>>
<<<Despite the many technical improvements that have been introduced over the past 40 years the wing, fuselage and control surface arrange- ment of modern aircraft appear little different to the original Comet design (Fig.>>>
<<<3.1).>>>
<<<Only the engine installation has changed, from the original buried layout to the podded configurations used today.>>>
<<<Even this change has its origins in the successful Boeing 707 (Fig.>>>
<<<3.2, not to the same scale as Fig.>>>
<<<3.1) layout which entered service only six years later than the Comet.>>>
<<<It is a tribute to the skill and foresight of the early designers that they selected an overall configuration which has not been beaten by the powerful computer technology now available in modern design offices.>>>
<<<This review of the configuration disguises significant advances in aerodynamic drag reduction, improved lift generation, more efficient and lighter engines, changes to the structural materials and the methods of manufacture, the integration of systems, increased reliability, and the adoption of modern avionics and computer control technologies.>>>
<<<The inaugural Comet flight from London to Johannesburg was slow by present day standards and it required refuelling stops at Rome, Beirut, Khartoum, Entebbe and Livingston.>>>
<<<Although it took nearly 25 hours to complete the flight this halved Fig.>>>
<<<3.1 Comet 1 layout.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.2 Boeing 707-320 layout.>>>
<<<the previous scheduled flying time; a feat only equalled when the Concorde entered service 25 years later on the transatlantic route.>>>
<<<The original aircraft carried only 36 passengers over a range of 2800 km.>>>
<<<This specification would now class it as a small regional/domestic operation.>>>
<<<Since 1952 aircraft designers have increased passenger capacity to more than 500 and extended the range capability on some aircraft to over 15000 km.>>>
<<<Engine designers have developed the original pure turbojet engine into highly fuel efficient turbofans with thrust exceeding 40OkN.>>>
<<<AU these technical improvements are impressive; redesigning the Comet with modern engines, aerodynamic improvements and modern materials would double the range for the same take-off weight.>>>
<<<Novel layouts Aircraft designers have constantly searched for more efficient configurations.>>>
<<<This has led to the study of many unconventional design concepts.1 Although unusual Engine installation (three engines) Fig.>>>
<<<3.3 Early Comet design layouts.>>>
<<<layouts have not yet superseded conventional designs, they have been studied seriously as each concept offers potential operational and technical advantages.>>>
<<<To the present time, the commercial risks involved in developing new layouts have been assessed as unacceptable.>>>
<<<As air transport requirements evolve, unconventional designs may become more viable.>>>
<<<It is therefore worth studying some of the most promising design concepts that have been investigated over the recent past.>>>
<<<All airliners are symmetrical about the vertical centreplane: the left-hand side is a mirror-image of the right-hand side.>>>
<<<This is not surprising as all birds are like this and nature has had a longer evolutionary path!>>>
<<<Most of the novel design layouts still retain this symmetry.>>>
<<<Even at the time of the first Comet, design teams studied unusual layouts.>>>
<<<Figure 3.3 shows the canard design layout studied by De Havilland in response to a UK government initiative in 1943-44.>>>
<<<This shows how the early designers of commercial aircraft were striving to reduce the adverse effect of trim drag.>>>
<<<This led the design team to consider the canard configuration.>>>
<<<Compared to the previous propeller engined installations, the new compact jet engines could be positioned within the aircraft structure.>>>
<<<On early engine designs intake geometry was not as critical as on later engines.>>>
<<<Three engines were necessary on this design as larger thrust engines were not yet available.>>>
<<<The same design team also studied twin-boom and tail-less layouts for the initial Comet specification.>>>
<<<It was felt at the time that the new jet engines offered the potential to introduce radical changes to the aircraft configuration but caution prevailed and a traditional layout was eventually selected for the new airliner.>>>
<<<The multi-hull layouts In recent times the design of very large aircraft (>1000 passengers) has highlighted a number of problems associated with increasing the size of the conventional layout.>>>
<<<One such problem relates to the emergency egress of passengers from large fuselage structures within the evacuation time specified in the airworthiness regulations.>>>
<<<To overcome this problem and partially to take advantage of distributing the passenger load along the wing the multi-hull concept has been proposed2'3 (shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.4).>>>
<<<The conventional fuselage layouts used in these multi-hull studies satisfy the evacuation requirements.>>>
<<<Also, the positioning of the fuselages away from the aircraft centreline produces inertia relief loads to the wing lift.>>>
<<<It is estimated that this relief load will substantially reduce wing and fuselage structure weight.>>>
<<<Estimates on these designs predicted an 8% saving in aircraft empty weight.>>>
<<<In the twin-hull configuration the flight deck, positioned in the nose of one of the fuselages, is offset from the aircraft centreline.>>>
<<<This has raised concern from pilots due to the unnatural 'feel' for the aircraft.>>>
<<<Simulator tests have confirmed the difficulty of flying the aircraft in an emergency (e.g.>>>
<<<with one engine failed) from the off-set pilot position.>>>
<<<To avoid this problem the three-hull version has been proposed, Fig.>>>
<<<3.4 Twin-fuselage layout.>>>
<<<see Fig.>>>
<<<3.5.>>>
<<<This avoids the pilot control problem but still partially retains inertia relief on the wing from the outboard fuselages and satisfies escape criteria.>>>
<<<The main technical difficulties of multi-hull designs are concerned with the aerodynamic and structural analysis of the wing between the fuselages.>>>
<<<The airflow conditions over the interconnecting surface(s) and the interference effects of the fuselage walls are unknown.>>>
<<<The resulting airflow distributions raise concerns about the effectiveness of flaps and other controls and the consequential effects on aircraft dynamics.>>>
<<<The structural analysis of the airframe bounded by the fuselages is complicated by the dynamic behaviour of the hulls.>>>
<<<It is expected that the free motion of the hulls will generate substantial twisting and bending on the interconnecting structure.>>>
<<<These effects are unknown and will undoubtedly cause a substantial increase in weight.>>>
<<<Due to the technical uncertainties described above the multi-hull configuration has not yet challenged conventional single-fuselage layouts; however, the potential of structural weight saving from directly coupling lift forces with inertia payload relief has resulted in a number of other unconventional design layouts.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.5 Triple-fuselage layout.>>>
<<<The span-loader layout In the span-loader aircraft shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.6, the payload is held in the main wing-box structure.>>>
<<<A small centrally positioned fuselage pod houses the flight deck and central services.>>>
<<<In this configuration the wing structure is relieved of most of the bending loads because the aircraft operational weight is balanced directly by the lift from the wing sections.>>>
<<<A saving of about 10% in aircraft take- off weight over an equivalent conventional layout has been claimed for the concept.>>>
<<<Such a layout would require about the same overall dimensions (span and length) as a conventional design.>>>
<<<Boeing proposed a passenger variant of the span-loader as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.7.>>>
<<<The central structure housed the engines (in this case nuclear power!)>>>
<<<and the flight deck.>>>
<<<The passenger cabin stretched the full span of the wings and had forward- facing windows positioned in the leading edge.>>>
<<<Apart from the type of powerplants this concept was first proposed by Junkers in 1910!>>>
<<<The main disadvantages of the concept are the difficulties of loading the payload into the congested central wing space and the resulting structural layout implications.>>>
<<<Concerns are also raised about egress routes and evacuation times in Six engines Fuel tanks Payload areas Fig.>>>
<<<3.6 Span-loader layout.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.7 Boeing's passenger span-loader.>>>
<<<emergency conditions.>>>
<<<In the design layout shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.6 the aircraft payload was specified as cargo only.>>>
<<<The uncertainty of the design layout with respect to the unorthodox flight control system, and the reduced aircraft responsiveness in roll due to the increased aircraft moments of inertia, presents significant cause for concern.>>>
<<<The flying-wing layout The prospect of distributing passengers in auditorium-type space has often been used to promote the concept of a flying-wing aircraft, now referred to as the 'blended-wing body' concept.>>>
<<<Both Airbus and McDonnell-Douglas have recently shown such layouts, see Fig.>>>
<<<3.8.>>>
<<<The main advantage for this layout lies in the potential for increased passenger cabin volume and the associated improvement in comfort level.>>>
<<<The designers also point out that the distributed payload will give increased inertia relief and therefore reduce structure weight.>>>
<<<There is less technical uncertainty attached to this configuration than the previous concepts but the need for increased wing thickness and the delta wing planform suggests that it will be less aerodynamically efficient than con- ventional layouts.>>>
<<<The renewed interest in this layout is associated with improved aerodynamic efficiency from active boundary layer (laminar flow) Optional winglets Fuel tanks Three engines Passenger cabin Flight deck Fig.>>>

<<<control systems and the need to build much higher capacity aircraft that will fit into existing airport facilities.>>>
<<<The question to be answered is 'will passengers travel in an aircraft devoid of windows?'>>>
<<<If so, the flying-wing may be seriously considered.>>>
<<<A hybrid between the flying wing and the distributed load has been suggested by the designer of the mega-jet.4 The proposed layout is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.9.>>>
<<<This is a 1000-b passenger aircraft with about 50% more cabin space per passenger than conventional aircraft.>>>
<<<This layout offers the prospect of providing ship-type passenger facilities (bars, casinos, cafes, shops and offices).>>>
<<<Technically the concept appears feasible but the adoption of a radical concept in a very conservative industry seems unlikely unless other criteria (e.g.>>>
<<<passenger comfort and facility provision) become important.>>>
<<<The canard layout Apart from the original Comet projects mentioned earlier the canard layout has its ancestry in the original Wright Flyer which had the control surfaces ahead of the mainplane.>>>
<<<This configurations avoids the tail-down forces required for trim on conventional layouts.>>>
<<<Much research has been focused on a return to the canard Fig.>>>
<<<3.10 The canard layout (source Airbus).>>>
<<<configuration for airlines as the trim drag in cruise will be reduced and useful fuel saving made.>>>
<<<Figure 3.10 shows a recent investigation into the advanced concept 220-260 seat airliner from Airbus.>>>
<<<In the past, the risk of nose-up overturning due to inadvertent mainplane stall whilst the canard surface is generating lift has stopped the adoption of the concept except for some military and home built designs.>>>
<<<As aircraft computer control becomes more sophisticated and the reliability of such systems increases, the possibility of using the canard concept increases.>>>
<<<In some design proposals, a three surface (canard, mainplane and tailplane) layout has been suggested to split the balancing load and the control loads between front and rear surfaces.>>>
<<<Although the aerodynamic stability and control features are simplified by this arrangement the addition of extra surfaces with the attendant structural and mechanical complication are serious disadvantages.>>>
<<<The tandem-wing layout Extending the concept of dividing the lift generation between two surfaces to minimise the number of controls has led to the tandem-wing layout shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.11.>>>
<<<It is interesting to note that the tandem wing configuration was studied in great detail in the early years of aircraft design.5 Although there have always been strong proponents for this layout, as it provides more tolerance to centre of gravity movement, it has yet to be adopted for commercial designs.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.11 The tandem-wing layout (source Lockheed).>>>
<<<To make the tandem-wing structures stiffer some designers have suggested joining the wing tips of the two surfaces.>>>
<<<This idea produces the coupled biplane concept with a large longitudinal stagger between the two surfaces as shown above.>>>
<<<Each of the above configurations (canard, tandem and biplane) has the advantage of reducing overall aircraft wing span but retaining a reasonable aspect ratio for each surface.>>>
<<<This, it is claimed, will give reduced cruise drag and improved aerodynamic efficiency.>>>
<<<A structural weight reduction can also be claimed due to the integrated wing structure and the consequential reduction in fuselage bending stresses.>>>
<<<The concepts have not yet been accepted because of the structural and aerodynamic uncertainty at the wing junctions and the risk of flight and structural instabilities.>>>
<<<The joined-wing The tandem-wing layout has recently been revived for commercial aircraft layouts due to the difficulty of fitting larger span aircraft into existing airport facilities.>>>
<<<Research6 has shown that a narrower rear surface with a tip junction at about the 80% span position on the front surface is the optimum layout as shown in the projected 500 seat design in Fig.>>>
<<<3.12.>>>
<<<Although substantial structural and aerodynamic advantages are claimed for the joined-wing concept, the technical uncertainties surrounding aerodynamic inter- ference effects and the novel structural framework have prevented its adoption.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.12 The joined-wing layout.>>>
<<<The flatbed layout The difficulties of loading a conventional fuselage with freight and passengers have led to the design of the modular aircraft.>>>
<<<The 'flatbed' design shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.13 can be quickly fitted with either a freight or passenger 'container' to reduce turn- round times for the aircraft and thereby increase aircraft utilisation and reduce airport stand occupancy.>>>
<<<There appears to be no technical reason why the concept should not be built Fig.>>>
<<<3.13 The flatbed layout.>>>
<<<but operationally the layout is complicated and liable to misuse.>>>
<<<Although modular designs may be adopted in the future they will need to be easier to use than the configuration shown above.>>>
<<<This concept appears to offer plenty of scope for ingenuity to new designers.>>>
<<<Why not everything!>>>
<<<It appears that the imagination of designers knows no bounds.>>>
<<<The combination of modular fuselage and three surface concepts has been proposed in the large Russian transporter shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.14.>>>
<<<Back to the beginning Until some unknown design or operational criteria come along to condition the aircraft layout to be different, it appears that the conventional configuration (shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.15) is here to stay.>>>
<<<The centrally positioned cylindrical fuselage set on a moderately swept trapezoidal low wing with podded engines and aft mounted control surfaces still offers aircraft designers ample opportunity to practice their skills.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.14 The 'everything' layout (source Molniya [Russian]).>>>
<<<System considerations The choice of aircraft configuration may be considered as an assembly of many sub-components.>>>
<<<The airframe although significant represents only a small part of the total design effort.>>>
<<<The inter-relationship between the airframe, engines and aircraft systems requires careful consideration when deciding the overall layout.>>>
<<<For example, there are many moving parts on the aircraft and each must be controlled and instrumented so that the pilot and flight management system can make safe decisions.>>>
<<<The structure must be able to react the loads that these parts impose and the airframe profile must enclose the units in an aerodynamic (low drag) shape.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<3.15 The conventional layout: Boeing 777-200 (source Boeing data).>>>
<<<Internal space requirements for the configuration may also impose their own conditions.>>>
<<<The fuel must be held in sealed tanks in the wing and (possibly) tail structures.>>>
<<<Between a quarter and a half of the aircraft weight will be attributed to this fuel; this places a significant demand on the internal volume of the aircraft and in some cases limits the minimum size of the wing for the aircraft to fly a specified range.>>>
<<<The cabin air conditioning system also requires internal space provision for the ducting and flow control units.>>>
<<<Although this is much less demanding in space than other requirements the system must run through the cabin taking up as little volume as possible and must be unobtrusive.>>>
<<<The aircraft flight management system although not physically demanding on space within the configuration has considerable influence on the size of control surfaces and the design of the associated operating systems.>>>
<<<The design of the flight management system offers a dilemma to the designers; should the system be given Fuel off-load and pressure valve Overwing refuel Hydraulic oil Toilet APU services Toilet Refuel Hydraulics (each engine) Water Oxygen Catering AC electrical Toilet Airstairs Engine oil (each engine) Fig.>>>
<<<3.16 Ground service requirements.>>>
<<<authority to over-ride unsafe decisions from the flight crew or should the captain retain the right to take full control of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Passengers are now expecting more facilities to be provided in the aircraft, particularly with regard to entertainment and business use.>>>
<<<This places increased demands on internal volume, weight and power supply.>>>
<<<Micro-miniaturisation of the electronics reduces these requirements but at the expense of increased aircraft purchase cost.>>>
<<<The aircraft designers must also consider layout requirements associated with servicing the aircraft (as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.16).>>>
<<<This is particularly important for a quick turn-round on the airport apron.>>>
<<<A full turn-round will involve refuelling, fresh water replenishment, re-supply of catering provisions, toilet servicing, cabin cleaning and cargo/baggage handling.>>>
<<<Many of these actions are done con- currently.>>>
<<<Space management around the aircraft during turn-round is a significant design consideration which may affect the overall layout of the aircraft components.>>>
<<<For example, the positioning of the ground service vehicles around the aircraft during turn-round may dictate the position of service doors and other features.>>>
<<<Such considerations may directly influence the aircraft layout.>>>
<<<Landing gear layout One of the principal moving parts on the aircraft is the landing gear.>>>
<<<This must be as light and small as possible.>>>
<<<It must provide good ride dynamics during taxiing and safe energy absorption at touchdown.>>>
<<<Retraction of the units is essential to reduce drag during flight.>>>
<<<This places a strong demand for space to house the landing gear, usually at the wing fuselage junction.>>>
<<<On many designs the landing gear bay requires separate fairing to enclose the wheels and shock absorber units.>>>
<<<A specialist section of the aerospace industry has been developed to deal with the design, manufacture and development of undercarriage components.>>>
<<<Normally, but not always, the aircraft manufacturer will subcontract the landing gear design to one of these specialist companies.>>>
<<<However, it is necessary for the aircraft project engineers to know something of the design parameters associated with landing gear design in order to produce an acceptable initial layout of the aircraft that will not compromise the design of the undercarriage and thereby increase the weight and cost.>>>
<<<The total landing gear system on an aircraft is a substantial contributor to weight and costs.>>>
<<<Typically it represents from 3-6% of the aircraft take-off mass (representing 8-15% of the structure mass) and about 2% of the aircraft price.>>>
<<<For many years research has been conducted into methods of eliminating the units completely since they are only used at the beginning and the end of the flight and present a considerable weight penalty during cruise.>>>
<<<Perhaps future development of vertical take-off and landing systems will provide an answer to this problem, although at present the landing gear on such aircraft tend to be more complicated than on conventional layouts!>>>
<<<In order that the design of the system can be properly understood it is necessary to carefully analyse the purpose of the landing gear.>>>
<<<This can be listed as: • to taxi to the take-off position and away from the runway at the end of the landing run; • to allow the aircraft to accelerate without the use of special equipment (catapult, etc.)>>>
<<<to allow rotation at the unstick speed; • to allow a change of direction at the instance of touchdown from the flying altitude to the runway gradient; • to assist in retarding the forward motion of the aircraft (braking) avoiding special equipment (arrester hooks).>>>
<<<Without the prospect of radical new ideas for landing gear design, the requirements listed above are met most conveniently by wheeled legs.>>>
<<<For stability on the ground three contact points are required.>>>
<<<The overall arrangement of these is at the designer's discretion.>>>
<<<On some experimental designs two units (one forward and one aft of the aircraft centre of gravity) have been used.>>>
<<<This layout is called the bicycle arrangement but as it is laterally unstable it needs wing mounted outriggers to stabilise the aircraft.>>>
<<<For the three unit landing gear there are basically two configurations.>>>
<<<Each type has two main wheel units near the centre of gravity of the aircraft and the third either behind (tail-wheel) or in front (nose-wheel).>>>
<<<The tail-wheel arrangement has largely gone out of favour because it produces an inclined passenger cabin floor, poor pilot visibility on the ground, is dynamically unstable (susceptible to ground looping) and presents the aircraft at a high drag attitude in the early part of the take-off run.>>>
<<<The nose-wheel arrangement is now universally adopted for civil turbofan aircraft even though it is heavier and more expensive than the tail layout.>>>
<<<Detail layout (conventional landing gear) The layout of the landing gear units is usually left until the overall aircraft configuration has been decided and an initial estimate made for the positions of the aircraft centre of gravity.>>>
<<<The aircraft configuration may impose certain constraints on the landing gear layout due to retraction difficulties and structural aspects but in general the following procedures (as related to Fig.>>>
<<<3.17) can be used to fix the wheel positions.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Determine the height of the aircraft centre of gravity above the runway (distance h) accounting for shock strut length and travel (in static load con- dition), tyre size and retraction geometry.>>>
<<<2.>>>
<<<Draw line AA through the main unit static ground position parallel to the fuselage centreline.>>>
<<<3.>>>
<<<The longitudinal position of the nose-wheel attachment to the fuselage should be consistent with structural framework in the front fuselage, making sure that the flight deck floor line and the pressure bulkhead positions are not unduly compromised.>>>
<<<Aircraft centre of gravity Fig.>>>
<<<3.17 Landing-gear layout.>>>
<<<4.>>>
<<<The position of the main wheel behind the aircraft centre of gravity must satisfy the following criteria for the most adverse aircraft centre of gravity position: • provide an adequate reverse stabilising moment for backward towing and general stability (an estimate of braking force will have to be made); • provide a righting moment when the fuselage is pulled down onto its tail stop; • provide at least a static load of 8% W on the nose-wheel to give reasonable steering forces (where W is the aircraft take-off weight); • provide not more than 15% W static load on the nose-wheel, as more than this will make it difficult to rotate the aircraft at take-off without an excessive tail force; • provide a pitching frequency of the aircraft of about 100 cycles per minute (certainly greater than 30 cycles per minute) - this involves the ratio of the radius of gyration in pitch, the wheelbase and the undercarriage stiffness; • provide sufficient tail-down angle (angle between lines AA and BB) for rotation of the aircraft at take-off and in the landing attitude.>>>
<<<The required position of the three units in plan is a matter of simple geometrical calculation.>>>
<<<For roll stability the main units should have a track (lateral distance between units) as large as possible with the general rule as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.18.>>>
<<<When more details are known a roll stiffness calculation should be attempted to show that the 'ride' is satisfactory.>>>
<<<A track which is too wide should be avoided as manoeuvring along narrow taxi-ways may be difficult.>>>
<<<The nose-wheel steering angle will be affected by track length for a given wheel base and this should be in- vestigated (the aircraft must be able to turn about the centreline of either main unit).>>>
<<<Overturning angle (6) Aircraft centre of gravity Main wheel unit (right) Main wheel unit (left) Aircraft centreline Nose wheel Fig.>>>
<<<3.18 Stability criteria for the wheel layout.>>>
<<<Energy absorption The landing gear has to be capable of absorbing the energy due to the aircraft change of direction in landing from the final glide slope (usually about 3°) to the essentially horizontal runway.>>>
<<<The energy to be absorbed is proportional to the vertical velocity of descent, v, squared, and the aircraft mass, M. Energy to be absorbed = 0.5 Mv2 [3.1] This energy has to be absorbed by the shock strut and the tyre.>>>
<<<Energy absorbed by the tyre is given by: ST x rjT x X x Mg [3.2] where: ST = tyre deflection rjT = tyre absorption efficiency X is the reaction factor = normal deceleration factor (i.e.>>>
<<<number of 'g's) M = aircraft landing mass g = normal deceleration = 9.81 ms~2 Energy absorbed by the shock strut is given by: S xrjsx Xx Mg [3.3] where: S = wheel travel t]s = absorber efficiency Equating [3.1] to [3.2] plus [3.3] and eliminating M we get: — = X(STrjT + Srjs) For a particular aircraft v and X will be specified (v — 3.5 m/s and X =2.0 are typical values).>>>
<<<For a particular tyre ST will be known and rjT can be assumed to equal 0.47.>>>
<<<The shock strut absorption efficiency (rjs) will depend upon the type of unit selected for the layout.>>>
<<<For conventional oelo-pneumatic units ris can be assumed to be 0.8.>>>
<<<Hence the shock absorber travel can be determined.>>>
<<<Example calculation Calculate the absorber travel required for a 60 seat regional jet aircraft with a vertical velocity of descent (v = 3.5m/s) at a deceleration (X =2) with tyre characteristics ((5T=9Omm, rjT = 0.47) and shock strut efficiency (t]s = 0.8).>>>
<<<Putting the values into the equation above gives: 3.52 2x9.81 ~ _ 2(0.47 x 90 + S x 0.8) 1000 Hence, absorber travel, S = 270 mm.>>>
<<<Tyre selection The pneumatic tyre has several merits and is usually chosen for highly-loaded units.>>>
<<<These advantages include the following.>>>
<<<• The contact surface stress can be chosen by simply selecting the inflation pressure.>>>
<<<A solid wheel of either metal or rubber has contact stresses that may be too high for the runway surface.>>>
<<<• The energy storage capacity for an air spring is higher for a given weight than metal or solid rubber.>>>
<<<• During braking the rubber provides good adhesion to the runway surface.>>>
<<<• The elasticity of the tyre lowers rolling drag (due to the damping out of the irregularities of the surface).>>>
<<<In the initial project stage it will be sufficient to use tyre sizes similar to comparable existing designs.>>>
<<<If space for retraction is restricted, the configuration is unorthodox, or the operation is unconventional (e.g.>>>
<<<rough field requirements), the tyre size may be selected by the criteria below.>>>
<<<A pneumatic tyre is an interesting example of an inflated structure which reacts load by relief of internal pressure.>>>
<<<Since the stiffness of the tyre is relatively low the ground load will be supported by the internal pressure on the ground contact area.>>>
<<<Aircraft tyres usually operate at between one third and half the fully-squashed deflection.>>>
<<<The load-carrying capability of a tyre can be expressed approximately as: P = constant -S -p (DW)05 where: 8 = deflection p = inflation pressure D = diameter W = width The deflection will be a function of the dimensional properties of the tyre.>>>
<<<As pressure increases the sizes of the tyre, DW, will reduce and thereby the weight, volume and frontal area.>>>
<<<The designer will seek to use tyre pressure as high as permissible, consistent with the operational features of the aircraft and runway surface condition.>>>
<<<Since the ground contact pressure is approximately equal to the inflation pressure, the landing surface must be capable of locally resisting the pressure.>>>
<<<The maximum allowable inflation pressure is a function of the landing surface.>>>
<<<Maximum tyre pressures for normal civil airport runways are around 120 psi.>>>
<<<As the allowable pressure is a function of the runway foundation construction it could drop to below 90 psi for some small private airstrips.>>>
<<<For either flexible (asphalt or tarmacadam) or rigid (concrete slab) runways another limiting factor is the single wheel load.>>>
<<<Each type of runway has a limiting strength and associated allowable tyre pressure.>>>
<<<In the past several different types of index have been used to define runway performance but these have now been replaced by the internationally agreed (ICAO) 'Aircraft Classification Number - Pavement Classification Number (ACN-PCN)'.>>>
<<<Values for ACN are quoted in ICAO Annex 14 which also includes the method of calculating the number.>>>
<<<A good description of the method which also reproduces some typical values for ACN for several civil aircraft is given in the References.7 Aircraft designed to be operated from runways of a particular value of PCN will require landing gear to be designed to an associated ACN value.>>>
<<<This may dictate the use of more than one wheel per axle or restrict the maximum value for tyre pressure (refer to specialist texts on landing gear design and supporting airworthiness/operational calculations for more detail).>>>
<<<Once the tyre pressure has been decided, the main wheel tyre can be selected from the manufacturers' catalogues (considering the load on each of the main units as 45% of the aircraft gross weight).>>>
<<<A check on the fully-squashed load should be made to ensure that the tyre does not 'bottom' before the full shock strut travel is reached.>>>
<<<The aspect ratio, D/ W, of the tyre is a design variable ranging from wide balloon tyres of less than 2.5 to narrow high pressure tyres at 5.0.>>>
<<<The choice is dependent upon stowage, braking and inflation characteristics.>>>
<<<The load on the nose-wheel will be increased from the static case by braking.>>>
<<<This must be considered in the selection of nose-wheel tyres.>>>
<<<It is usual to take the design load as either the static case or 80% of the dynamic case whichever is the greater.>>>
<<<Mechanical design The detailed design of the shock absorber and retraction mechanism is not usually considered in the project stage unless the overall aircraft configuration presents obvious difficulties in these areas (e.g.>>>
<<<stowage space restrictions).>>>
<<<To complete the aircraft general arrangement it will be sufficient to follow existing practice (e.g.>>>
<<<adopting the geometry of the landing gear from a similar existing aircraft).>>>
<<<Future developments Aircraft manufacture is an expensive and time consuming activity.>>>
<<<The shortest period from concept initiation to aircraft operational flight is unlikely to be less than four years.>>>
<<<Such timescales will only be possible for designs which are developments of an existing type (e.g.>>>
<<<aircraft stretch).>>>
<<<Typically, new designs take seven to ten years (or more) from conception to entry into service.>>>
<<<During this period substantial pre-sale investment is required.>>>
<<<Over the design period, operational requirements may change and so the design must be reasonably flexible.>>>
<<<It is unlikely that a new aircraft will only be manufactured in the original configuration.>>>
<<<New market opportunities, increases in productivity, development of new routes, etc.>>>
<<<will result in 'stretched' designs.>>>
<<<It is common for such stretches (plus re-engining and re-equipping of the original design) to produce a 'family' of aircraft as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<3.19.>>>
<<<For example, the Boeing 777 airliner will be developed into a family of at least five (and possibly ten) aircraft types (see Table 3.1), each with a different payload/range capability aimed at different markets (routes) as demand for the aircraft dictates (see Fig.>>>

<<<Safety and environmental issues Objective Some of the main constraints on the design of the aircraft result from mandatory and operational regulations.>>>
<<<Before the aircraft is accepted into service it must be demonstrated by analysis, ground tests and flying tests that it meets all the airworthiness and environmental standards that currently apply to the type.>>>
<<<When in service there is a continuing responsibility for the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft.>>>
<<<At the early stages of the design of the aircraft it is essential to understand the nature of the regulations that must be met as subsequent modifications to comply with the legislation will be expensive and probably delay the project timescales.>>>
<<<The safety of the aircraft is assured by the airworthiness conditions laid down by national and international bodies.>>>
<<<This chapter starts with a brief description of the framework in which these regulations are managed.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations govern the ethos of the design.>>>
<<<It is important to understand these aspects prior to the detailed consideration of aircraft component design as they may present constraints to the layout and performance of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Although airworthiness is described under the separate headings of structural integrity, system integrity, operation integrity and crashworthiness there is considerable involved in the overall aircraft configuration.>>>
<<<interdependence Environmental factors cover a wide range of aspects but noise and emissions are the main regulatory issues which affect the design of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Both are largely associated with engine design aspects and aircraft flight profiles.>>>
<<<With the expected growth in air traffic at the major airports the environmental pressure groups will become more vocal.>>>
<<<This could result in more demanding criteria to be met by aircraft and engine manufacturers and operators.>>>
<<<For student designers it may be better to read this chapter after the ones on component design and analysis as these sections show the influence of airworthiness and environmental influences and so put the various regulations into context.>>>
<<<Airworthiness Flying is potentially a dangerous form of transport.>>>
<<<High speeds, a three- dimensional flight path, hostile ambient conditions (at cruise altitudes), a highly inflammable fuel mass positioned close to passengers; all these are combined with the vagaries of the weather, random occurrences of other natural hazards (e.g.>>>
<<<ice and bird strikes) and, most significantly, human frailty.>>>
<<<Within this scenario the travelling public demand an uneventful and comfortable journey unaware of any danger.>>>
<<<Such expectations demand confidence in the mode of transport.>>>
<<<This can only be achieved in a highly controlled operation leading to a public perception of safety.>>>
<<<The fact that passengers seem more concerned about loss of luggage and long delays in airport terminals than the potential hazards is testament to the high quality of current airworthiness management.>>>
<<<The need to regulate the industry to achieve an acceptable standard of safety has been recognised since the early days of flight.>>>
<<<The degree, or extent, of the regulation is complicated by the obvious international spectrum of the business.>>>
<<<Since 1919 each nation has had absolute sovereignty over its airspace and been responsible for the execution of safety matters in its territory.>>>
<<<This principle has been jealously protected and complete delegation of this responsibility to any international organisation (e.g.>>>
<<<UN) has not been granted by any government.>>>
<<<Nevertheless, several multi-national bodies have arisen in an attempt to coordinate safety policy and advise governments on the world-wide control of aircraft equipment and operations.>>>
<<<Set within the international framework, aircraft safety must encompass design, manufacture, operation and environmental aspects.>>>
<<<As all these aspects are highly inter-dependent the regulations must reflect this inter-relationship.>>>
<<<Safety is not totally a function of laws and decrees.>>>
<<<It has always been recognised that an acceptable safety standard is dependent upon responsible attitudes on the part of all those who work and are involved in the air transport business.>>>
<<<Thankfully, past experience has shown that this personal responsibility pervades the industry and we must ensure that this continues into the future.>>>
<<<The legal responsibility for airworthiness rests with: • The airworthiness authority: for setting the standards and ensuring they are met.>>>
<<<Each country has its own regulatory body (e.g.>>>
<<<in the UK the Civil Aviation Authority [CAA] and in the USA the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]).>>>
<<<These vet the manufacturers and operators, issuing certificates of airworthiness, approving design and manufacturing companies, issuing operators' licences and controlling the standard of training for various personnel (e.g.>>>
<<<flight crew and maintenance engineers).>>>
<<<• Aircraft manufacturers: to demonstrate that the aircraft meets the required design standard, to define the operating limitations, to define the maintenance schedules, to provide product support, and to take responsibility for product improvements during the life of the aircraft.>>>
<<<• Operators: to comply with airworthiness documentation, to comply with technical documents, to report defects and to assist the manufacturers' manufacturers to maintain airworthiness standards.>>>
<<<The airworthiness design requirements are principally aimed at the certification of new products but in recent years there has been a growing awareness of the significance of aircraft aging (i.e.>>>
<<<the maintenance of airworthiness standards during the life of the product).>>>
<<<The original manufacturer, irrespective of the operational life of the product, remains responsible for the design standards and all associated aspects of airworthiness of the vehicle throughout its operational life.>>>
<<<replaced by an Design airworthiness requirements are contained in airworthiness regulations, for example, in the USA they are called Federal Airworthiness Regulations (FAR).>>>
<<<Individual national European regulations are now being 'harmonised' standard called Joint Airworthiness and Requirements (JAR).>>>
<<<For large civil transport aircraft with maximum take-off mass heavier than 12 5001b (5669 kg), the appropriate document is FAR Part 25 for USA and JAR25 for Europe.>>>
<<<These documents set out the design standard to be met and the method by which compliance to the standard can be demonstrated.>>>
<<<international The main subject headings in JAR25 are shown below.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Flight (analysedfor normal and emergency thrust/power) • Performance (stall, take-off, climb, en-route, landing, control speeds) • Controllability and manoeuvrability, trim, stability, stalling • Ground handling • Miscellaneous flight requirements (e.g.>>>

<<<Powerplant • General (propellers, vibration, reverse thrust systems), fuel systems and com- ponents, oil systems, cooling, air intake systems, exhaust systems • Powerplant control and accessories, fire protection, auxiliary power unit 5.>>>
<<<Equipment • General (flight and navigation instruments), instrumentation, electrical systems and equipment Safety Safety is not an 'absolute' concept.>>>
<<<The regulating authorities recognise acceptable 'levels of safety' which provide confidence to the travelling public and are also cost-effective.>>>
<<<The airworthiness of a particular operation is the status by which the aircraft (including engines and systems) is designed, maintained and operated to achieve an acceptable level of safety for passengers, crew and third parties.>>>
<<<Within this context, design airworthiness is defined by a set of regulations and codes of practice.>>>
<<<These provide an acceptable level of safety based on past experience.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations are continually under review and will be strength- ened if incidents show an area of concern.>>>
<<<Each nation controls its own airworthiness standard, usually through a government body or committee.>>>
<<<For the United Kingdom, this control is exercised through the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and for the USA through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).>>>
<<<Table 4.1 Levels of safety (source: JAR) Levels of safety - Categories of effect (Joint Airworthiness Requirements) Minor {Nuisance (IO"2 to 10~3 per hour)} (concerned with fleet service management and thereby occurring several times in the life of the aircraft) • Operating limitations, routine changes to flight plan, emergency procedures (1(T3 to 1(T5) • Physical effects but no injury to occupants (less than 10~5 per hour) Major {Remote (10~5 to 10~7 per hour)} (once in the operational life of an aircraft) • Significant reductions in safety margins • Difficulty for crew (adverse conditions which impair their efficiency) • Passenger minor injuries Hazardous {Extremely remote (10~7 to 10"9 per hour)} (e.g.>>>
<<<once in 20 years for a fleet) • Large reductions in safety margins • Crew extended due to increased workload or poor environment conditions (flight crew unable to perform their tasks accurately or completely) • Serious injury • Deaths of small number of occupants Catastrophic {Extremely improbable (less than ICT9 per hour)} (an unlikely event in the operational life of the aircraft type) • Multiple deaths • Usually total loss of aircraft.>>>
<<<Table 4.1 shows how effects are categorised and the numerical values assigned to their maximum occurrence.>>>
<<<A slight confusion may arise by the fact that the loss of an aircraft might sometimes be non-fatal, but this is regarded as an exception to the general spirit of the definition.>>>
<<<The intention is that catastrophic effects should virtually never occur in the total operating life of an aircraft type fleet.>>>
<<<Less hazardous failures may be accepted with the general rule that the probability of occurrence of a failure is inversely proportioned to its severity.>>>
<<<To understand the consequences of the quoted probabilities it is worth relating them to aircraft utilisation.>>>
<<<A single civil aircraft flying scheduled routes may be expected to be flown for about 3000hr/yr for an operational life of 15-20 years.>>>
<<<There may be 200 such aircraft in use, giving about 50 000 operational hours per aircraft making 107 hours per type.>>>
<<<Safety levels There are four main aspects to the regulations controlling the level of safety (Fig.>>>
<<<4.1).>>>
<<<All but the crashworthiness sections are aimed at avoiding accidents.>>>

<<<The paper records letters written by the Wright Brothers as they anticipated the need for pre-flight structural analysis and tests in their original gliders and the first Wright-Flyer.>>>

<<<We also hung it by the tips and ran the engine-screw with a man on-board .>>>
<<<.>>>
<<<.>>>
<<<The strength of the machine seems OK (November 1903).>>>
<<<It is interesting to note the optimistic view that was taken.>>>
<<<In these days, the rational analysis of the critical design case should have been based on the 'crashworthiness' of the vehicle!>>>
<<<The year 1928 saw the publication of the first set of British requirements (Handbook of Strength Calculations) although at this time they were not mandatory.>>>
<<<This was a military document (Air Publication 970) which reflected the main area of aeronautical interest at the time.>>>
<<<The early requirements considered the flight load cases as quasi-static conditions in which the flight manoeuvring accelerations were rationalised to inertia forces (load factors).>>>
<<<This practice is still commonly used today for the symmetric load analysis.>>>
<<<The original specific load factors (accelerations) varied according to the type of aircraft (aerobatic or normal category) but fell in the range 8.5 to 4.0.>>>
<<<These were equivalent to modern ultimate load criteria, and considering the fact that in the early days they worked to a safety factor of 2.0, they seem low by modern standards for military aircraft.>>>
<<<It was not until 1935 that the concept of 'proof load' cases was suggested.>>>
<<<A proof to ultimate ratio of 0.75 was originally used and this compares favourably with the present civil aircraft value of 0.67.>>>
<<<Eventually the ultimate factor was reduced to 1.5 and remains at this value today.>>>
<<<With the passage of time no-one can give a rational explanation for the choice of this value.>>>
<<<It is generally agreed that the factor is introduced to account for the variability in material properties, variability in manufacturing standards, deterioration in service and uncertainty (and inaccuracy) in stressing methods.>>>
<<<It may be argued that all these aspects have improved over the last 40 years and therefore the factor should be reduced.>>>
<<<Set against this possibility is the increased level of structural complexity, increased aircraft performance, greater utilisation and extra longevity of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The original load cases were effectively aircraft attitude dependent (low speed at high angle of attack, high speed at low angle of attack).>>>
<<<This type of analysis led directly to the development of the flight and operational envelopes which are commonplace today.>>>
<<<These methods assumed a rigid aircraft structure in which distortions due to load did not affect the flight action.>>>
<<<In early braced-wing and fuselage structures this was acceptable but the development of the thin cantilever monoplane design gave rise to more flexible structures.>>>
<<<This led to the development of dynamic response analysis and the introduction of flexural and torsional stiffness criteria.>>>
<<<As early as 1930 four aeroelastic phenomena were recognised (aileron flutter, wing flexural/torsional flutter, control reversal and wing divergence).>>>
<<<In fact, retrospective analysis of Langley's original aircraft suggests that aeroelastic flaws may have robbed him and the American scientific establishment of the prize for first powered flight.>>>
<<<Since then many more instances of aeroelastic problems on new aircraft have arisen.>>>
<<<The usual quick-fix for these effects is to increase wing torsional stiffness and mass-balance the control surfaces.>>>
<<<Both these add weight to the aircraft and thereby reduce its effectiveness but the regulations insist on such measures.>>>
<<<It is only in the past few years that more sophisticated methods of controlling aeroelastic effects have been allowed.>>>
<<<These form part of 'active control technology' (ACT).>>>
<<<However, the introduction of artificial coupling between structural and system aspects raises other airworthiness questions.>>>
<<<These are considered in more detail in the 'system integrity' section described below.>>>
<<<The early flight envelope load cases assumed 'still-air' conditions.>>>
<<<It soon became clear that air turbulence could give rise to critical flight cases.>>>
<<<In 1942 the 'gust- encounter' was introduced into the regulations.>>>
<<<These early calculations did not take account of the dynamic response of the aircraft or the variability in the gust profile.>>>
<<<Only the single case of meeting a 25 ft/sec up and down gust at the aircraft design diving speed was considered.>>>
<<<This was soon expanded into the 25, 50, 66 ft/sec gust series now specified and used to describe the aircraft gust envelope.>>>
<<<To overcome the potential errors involved by ignoring the gust variability, the concept of the 'sharp-edge gust' and the application of 'gust alleviation factors' was introduced.>>>
<<<The alleviation factor is a function of wing loading and lift-curve slope (with other parameters) but this evaluation still ignored aircraft structural flexibility.>>>
<<<Eventually the requirements modelled more accurately the gust profile with either a linear or cosine function over the prescribed build-up distance (usually 100 ft).>>>
<<<The requirement now is for the analysis of the dynamic amplifi- cation of the wing stress due to flexibility.>>>
<<<This departure from the original 'rigid' aircraft analysis has brought with it the requirement to expand the number of stressing cases to cover the possibility that wing sections away from the bodyside may be critical (peak stress conditions could no longer be assumed to occur simultaneously.)>>>
<<<In recent years, designing to meet the gust cases has become more complicated with the introduction of more sophisticated aerodynamic wing design, the introduction of devices that create local random turbulence conditions, and the consideration of gusts coming from any direction (not just vertically or horizontally).>>>
<<<This has led to the development of dynamic response calculations being applied to the aircraft design in areas outside the gust environment (e.g.>>>
<<<landing, impact loads control responsiveness).>>>
<<<Interpretation of gust criterion can be found in airworthiness regulations (e.g.>>>
<<<JAR 25-ACJ 25.305(d)).>>>
<<<The major omission in the development of the structural requirements has been the effect of the pilot on the aircraft.>>>
<<<The regulations insist that the pilot is considered as taking no action that would alleviate the loading effect.>>>
<<<This conservative criterion was based on the knowledge of the unpredictable behaviour and ability of pilots.>>>
<<<As the pilot's workload is slowly being relieved by computer control and a more repeatable response can be assumed from the non-human system, it is becoming feasible to add the controller into the response equations (active-control).>>>
<<<In fact it would now be erroneous to ignore these effects since they may represent significant input to the total aircraft system.>>>
<<<Again, such developments link the structural airworthiness issues to system failure modes and system confidence levels.>>>
<<<Of all the developments in structural airworthiness, the necessary consideration of metal fatigue has made the greatest impact.>>>
<<<The subject was largely ignored until the late 40s but now it represents the major element in structural air- worthiness.>>>
<<<Initially fatigue was regarded as a phenomenon affecting only rotating machinery which accumulated millions of loading cycles in operation.>>>
<<<The Comet crashes in the mid-50s highlighted the serious consequences of high stress/low cycle fatigue in pressurised fuselages.>>>
<<<These accidents led to the forfeit of the commercial advantage held by De Havilland as a result of their initiation of the first jet airliner service mentioned in Chapter 1.>>>
<<<Although much was learnt about fatigue analysis and the design strategies to avoid problems, De Havilland never regained the commercial initiative from their American rivals.>>>
<<<Strategies to combat fatigue failures in the early days involved the prediction of 'safe-life' stress levels.>>>
<<<The difficulty of using this approach for aluminium alloy parts lay in the uncertainty of selecting safe stresses from the fatigue curves for the materials used.>>>
<<<Furthermore, it was shown that the major aircraft assemblies (e.g.>>>
<<<wing spars, landing gear) were subjected to a wide spectrum of load amplitudes and frequencies.>>>
<<<The available data for the material was based on constant amplitude/cycle tests.>>>
<<<Crude semi-empirical laws were developed to estimate fatigue damage per flight cycle and then to predict the aircraft fatigue life (to a chosen degree of probability).>>>
<<<Nowadays direct stress (strain) measurements are used to estimate cumulative fatigue damage to critical parts of the structure.>>>
<<<In those areas where a safe-life could not be confidently predicted the concept of 'fail-safe' was applied.>>>
<<<The inherent scatter of fatigue test results and the inability to predict the catastrophic failure of some early designs led to the adoption of redundant structures in which the various elements could be periodically inspected for fatigue damage.>>>
<<<Once the concept of regular inspection was accepted as a justifiable structural design strategy the analytical interest centred on the rate of crack propagation.>>>
<<<The requirements were set for a sub- critical crack length to be detected between scheduled service inspections.>>>
<<<The development of methods for predicting the critical crack length and the rate of crack growth led to the introduction of 'fracture mechanics' and the concept of 'damage tolerance'.>>>
<<<A combination of safe-life prediction to dictate stress intensity levels and fail-safe (plus inspection) is the current strategy for design to avoid catastrophic fatigue failure.>>>
<<<The concepts of fail-safe and safe-life are often mis- understood (or misinterpreted).>>>
<<<W. G. Heath suggested that a better description of the modern technique would be 'safe by inspection' or 'inspection dependent' safety.>>>
<<<In the early years of civil aviation structural airworthiness tests were completed ahead of the operational life to ensure safety.>>>
<<<Nowadays it is not possible to design suitable tests to give adequate assurance from an airworthiness point of view.>>>
<<<The specification of tests raises several awkward questions, including: How do we predict the critical areas to be inspected?>>>
<<<How reliable are the inspections?>>>
<<<When do you terminate the life of a part?>>>
<<<How do you account for repaired structures?>>>
<<<How do you allow for aging of the structure?>>>
<<<To combat some of the fears, the airworthiness authorities now ask for a 'Structural Integrity Audit'.>>>
<<<In this, the combined service experience of the fleet can be assembled and problem areas identified.>>>
<<<As a consequence of this reporting, the degradation of the structure due to other causes (corrosion, accidental damage, manufacturing defects) can be recorded and used to indicate potential problem areas.>>>
<<<Acceptable means of compliance for 'Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation of Structure' can be found in airworthiness regulations (e.g.>>>
<<<JAC25- ACJ25.571(a)).>>>
<<<System integrity An aircraft may be regarded as a series of systems (or as one large system).>>>
<<<A very useful description of system airworthiness may be found in a book by E. Lloyd and W. Tye.1 Originally, the individual aircraft systems were 'self-contained' and purposely designed so that a failure in one would not influence the safe operation of the other systems and would not cause the aircraft to crash.>>>
<<<This is still a design criterion but, following the introduction of the Autoland system in the early 70s and with the recent developments of automatic (computer-controlled) systems, more sophisticated safety assessments are necessary today.>>>
<<<Modern systems contain many inter-connections between aircraft functions (e.g.>>>
<<<automatic landing, auto-pilot, engine management, stall avoidance, auto-stabilisation and active load control).>>>
<<<This means that a more systematic approach to the effects of individual component failure is demanded.>>>
<<<For example, the relatively simple system control- ling yaw-damping requires cross-coupling of electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, instrumentation and computer systems.>>>
<<<Failure of a component in this system must not immobilise other, potentially more essential, flight systems.>>>
<<<The airworthiness requirements are purposely drafted in broad terms.>>>
<<<The designers must conduct failure analysis for each system and also ensure safe operation of each aircraft function.>>>
<<<Historical strategies for safe operation involving duplication or triplication of systems have now been superseded.>>>
<<<Redundancy of these systems still features in the design but the analysis now requires the degree of risk to be estimated.>>>
<<<Assessment of the systems involves failure mode of effect analysis (FMEA).>>>
<<<When making this assessment account must be taken of previous experience on similar systems, the variation in the performance of systems (the statistical distribution), awareness of the crew to the failure and their prescribed emergency actions, the probability (capability) of detecting the failure (warning systems), and aircraft inspection and maintenance procedures.>>>
<<<It must be remembered that although an engineering failure analysis can be conducted in a quantifiable way, any failure resulting from human error may be difficult to assess.>>>
<<<This puts the emphasis on selection and training methods and management control.>>>
<<<The regulations insist that the quantifiable assessment must be based on a pessimistic analysis based on the cockpit layout, speed of actions, simulation and operational awareness.>>>
<<<Maintenance induced errors are equally difficult to quantify.>>>
<<<The assessment must consider the likelihood of the maintenance staff 'modifying' the design concept and thereby increasing failure rate.>>>
<<<Both flight crew and maintenance staff induced effects are only minimised by careful attention to detail design and good management control.>>>
<<<Operational integrity For airworthiness purposes, performance data are needed for the complete range of airframe configuration and engine settings.>>>
<<<This data must be provided for all the anticipated states for temperature, pressure, runway condition, runway gradient and wind effects.>>>
<<<Also, the effect of engine failure on performance at critical flight phases must be determined.>>>
<<<All these requirements represent a considerable amount of effort on the part of the manufacturer.>>>
<<<Many flight tests must be conducted to evaluate the flight margins with adverse drag tolerances, adverse environmental conditions and minimum-level engine performance.>>>
<<<The minimum tolerance for these margins is specified in the airworthiness requirements together with the definition of the acceptable flying techniques to prove the values.>>>
<<<Examples of these conditions can be found in the specified take-off and landing techniques (see FAR/JAR-ACJ [Advisory Circular Joint]).>>>
<<<Apart from demonstrating the safe flying characteristics of the prototype aircraft, the flight tests also provide the information used for computing the aircraft flight manual data.>>>
<<<Since most of the operational data are dependent on many variables the data in these manuals is condensed to derive simplified charts for safe flight (operation).>>>
<<<Many aspects of the aircraft design (structure, aerodynamics, powerplant and systems) are influenced by the operational limits imposed by the airworthiness regulations.>>>
<<<Some examples are given below: • minimum speed for rotation at take-off • minimum speed to maintain lateral control in the event of an engine failure • maximum speed to avoid aerodynamic buffet • minimum speed to avoid stall (or alternatively limits on the angle of attack) • minimum speed in the second segment climb phase • maximum speed in the approach to landing phase (crosswind limits) • minimum speed to operate thrust reverses • brake system energy and torque limitations • maximum speed for operation of high-lift devices • speed and height limits imposed on engine operation in non-standard atmospheric conditions (hot and high) • maximum speed for engine re-light after shut-down, including the effect of altitude This list represents only a small selection of the limitations imposed by the airworthiness regulations.>>>
<<<Speed limitations may also be imposed to protect the aircraft structural framework.>>>
<<<These may be in the form of airspeed and Mach number boundaries.>>>
<<<Typical constraints are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<4.2.>>>

<<<Full application of controls should be only made at or near speed VA.>>>
<<<The definition of speeds together with the stall boundaries (the limits of maximum lift coefficients, C1^x, for the aircraft) and normal acceleration limits are combined to establish the flight and gust envelopes (see Fig.>>>
<<<4.3).>>>
<<<These are used to produce the aircraft loading cases associated with weight, balance geometry and other configurational variations.>>>
<<<Worst case conditions are the basis for structural analysis.>>>
<<<This forms part of the duties of the Structural Analysis Office.>>>
<<<Such analysis provides confidence in the structural integrity of the aircraft to the hazardous (10~7) and catastrophic (IO"9) levels of safety.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations specify the most likely loads (to the accepted level of risk) that the aircraft should resist.>>>
<<<These are termed 'limit loads'.>>>
<<<The aircraft must be capable of reacting these loads multiplied by a factor called the 'proof factor' without suffering substantial permanent deformation.>>>
<<<Also, the structure must not fail below a load equal to the limit load multiplied by the 'ultimate factor'.>>>
<<<For civil airliners the proof factor is fixed at 1.0 and the ultimate factor at 1.5.>>>
<<<When stressing the aircraft the applied stresses resulting from the proof or ultimate design loads must be less than the allowable proof and failure stresses for the material and structural shape.>>>
<<<The ratio of allowable stress (or load) to the applied stress (or load) is termed the 'reserve factor'.>>>
<<<This must be greater than unity for the structure to be safe.>>>
<<<The USA practice is to subtract 1.0 from the value of reserve factor and call it the 'margin of safety'.>>>

<<<Associated with each of these items is a data section on 'method of demon- strating compliance' (e.g.>>>
<<<Section 2 - ACJ).>>>
<<<The operational integrity of the aircraft is governed by these regulations.>>>
<<<Crashworthiness This subject is dealt with in detail in Chapter 5, but a summary of the main points is given below for completeness in the discussion on airworthiness.>>>
<<<Even with the finest attention to airworthiness, accidents may occur.>>>
<<<The crashworthiness aspects are aimed at improving the chance of surviving in the event of these accidents.>>>
<<<It is difficult to set specific requirements in this area; the best that can be done is to make the most of what technology can offer.>>>
<<<The main difficulty in this approach is the high emotive pressure, particularly from the press, that exists at the time of an accident.>>>
<<<Aircraft accidents vary enormously from the totally non-survivable mid-air collision, to the relatively inconsequential disputes with other aircraft and airport equipment during taxiing and docking.>>>
<<<For the first, there is little the airworthiness regulations can do except provide for preventive measures (flashing beacons, better visibility, etc.)>>>
<<<and improve operational management (air traffic control).>>>
<<<Fortunately, the majority of accidents do present the possibility for survivability.>>>
<<<Crash survival requires that the occupants both survive the impact and are then able to evacuate the aircraft before the post-crash hazards become intolerable.>>>
<<<The requirements therefore consider each of the following factors: • crashworthiness of the structure • adequate restraint of the occupants • provide a non-injurious environment • provide, where possible, reductions in the crash forces • give protection against fire hazards • ensure safe egress from the vehicle The list above is presented in the relative order of priority for the designers.>>>
<<<The general guidelines may be the following detail design requirements.>>>
<<<transformed into • Ensuring that the basic structure around the occupants provides a protective envelope which will be stiff enough to guarantee that the emergency exits still function.>>>
<<<• The seats and restraint straps are designed to ensure that occupant movement within the protective envelope is arrested before and during the impact.>>>
<<<• Elimination of dangerous features within the cabin and cockpit.>>>
<<<This is often only a matter of careful detail design or passenger management (e.g.>>>
<<<closed lockers on overhead luggage racks).>>>
<<<Potentially serious hazards when identified can often be easily eliminated (e.g.>>>
<<<by stowage in secure parts of the aircraft or by not carrying the cargo).>>>
<<<• Maximum crash forces (or accelerations) must be reduced to human tolerance levels.>>>
<<<This can often be accomplished by the detail design of the surrounding structure, restraint system and seat design.>>>
<<<Exact analysis is not possible.>>>
<<<The designer has to show that providing the structural envelope, the seat and the restraint system remain intact, then the forces on the passengers are tolerable.>>>
<<<Past experience has shown that this is acceptable.>>>
<<<• Designing the fuel system and fuel tanks to resist major damage in the crash, placing fuel as far away from the occupants as possible, and keeping fuel lines outside the occupied areas are all design requirements that will reduce the risk of fire.>>>
<<<Unfortunately it is not always possible to follow these 'guidelines' due to aircraft layout.>>>
<<<Research into the use of smoke-hoods and cabin water spray systems are examples of requirements.>>>
<<<the continuing development of such • Avoiding or reducing the risk of disabling injuries and careful attention to the provision of escape routes for all crash situations is a natural design responsi- bility.>>>
<<<Several airworthiness requirements are aimed at these issues (for example the recently introduced regulations concerning the location of emergency exits and the installation of floor track lighting).>>>
<<<Certificate of airworthiness The conclusion from the airworthiness analysis of the aircraft is the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A) for the design.>>>
<<<This represents an expensive but unavoidable element in the total development of the aircraft project.>>>
<<<The C of A is only valid for the design as tested and manufactured by the approved organisation.>>>
<<<If modifications to the design are made or if the manufacturing methods or organisation are changed, the C of A has to be re-issued.>>>
<<<This will only be done if the airworthiness authorities believe that the changes do not reduce the safety standard.>>>
<<<Within this context it is inevitable that major changes will require extra flight, structural or system tests to be conducted.>>>
<<<It has been shown in the past that even small alterations to the original design may lead to unsafe operation and therefore the Airworthiness Board is extremely cautious in the automatic extension to the original certificate.>>>
<<<The cost of testing can be high and must be accounted for when considering the development of an existing aircraft con- figuration (e.g.>>>
<<<re-engining or fuselage stretch).>>>
<<<As such, the certification processes is a key element in the aircraft programme.>>>
<<<The flight test programme forms only one element, albeit highly significant, in this process.>>>
<<<Nearly all the specialist departments in the company are concerned with meeting the airworthiness requests in full.>>>
<<<This involvement ranges from function tests to analysis of operational practice (failure analysis and reliability).>>>
<<<To achieve a Certificate of Airworthiness the aircraft will be supported by numerous analytical reports and other documentation.>>>
<<<These will cover all aspects of the design of the aircraft plus required operational practices (e.g.>>>
<<<pilot training, maintenance requests, reporting procedures, etc.).>>>
<<<When an aircraft is sold to an airline it will be accompanied by a C of A.>>>
<<<This is specific to the aircraft and to the issuing authority (e.g.>>>
<<<FAA, CAA).>>>
<<<The manufacturer accepts responsibility for the safe operation of the aircraft and in so doing stipulates the procedures and practices required for maintenance and operation.>>>
<<<Failure to conform to these will invalidate the C of A and result in the airworthiness authority withdrawing the licence to the operator.>>>
<<<Although such practices seem to impose unnecessary overheads on the airline it is generally accepted that safety must be ensured.>>>
<<<Environmental issues Even in the pioneering days, aviation had critics who commented that aircraft were noisy, smelly and an intrusion into their private lives.>>>
<<<As aircraft have become more numerous, larger and more powerful the environmentalists have become more influential.>>>
<<<The expansion of turbojet commercial services flying over (and into) already congested and polluted cities has highly politicised the environmental issues.>>>
<<<New York politicians in the early 60s under pressure from voters unilaterally imposed restrictions on the noise generated by aircraft operations and installed measuring equipment at and around the airport to monitor offending airlines and allow sanctions to be imposed.>>>
<<<At about the same time other cities (notably Los Angeles) were concerned about the level of airborne pollution generated from engine emissions in climatic inversion-layer conditions.>>>
<<<Although this fog was related principally to ground transport vehicles, the public visibility of aircraft smoke trails and the smell of unburnt kerosene near airports focused public attention which resulted in legislation on aircraft emissions.>>>
<<<Aircraft and engines are now regulated with regard to both noise and emission pollution.>>>
<<<When designing aircraft it is necessary to understand the implications of these environmental controls on aircraft operations and the consequential effects on detail aircraft component design.>>>
<<<Although noise and emissions are inter- related by common engine design parameters it is convenient to separate the two issues.>>>
<<<Each is described separately below.>>>
<<<Aircraft noise Following several research studies, technical meetings, conferences and law suits, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) eventually recommended national legislation that would match the existing US noise control rules.>>>
<<<This was done by adding a formal appendix (Annex 16) to the 1944 Chicago Convention.>>>
<<<The American legislation formed a separate section to the FAR (identified as Part 36).>>>
<<<The established international and national regulations now impose maximum noise exposure at three critical operating conditions (see Fig.>>>
<<<4.4).>>>
<<<Three noise recording locations (under the approach, under the take-off paths and to the side of the runway) are used to enclose an airport box.>>>
<<<The measure- ments are aggregated to form a single value for the operations at the airport.>>>
<<<In the early form of the legislation this value was set at 108EPNdB (effective perceived noise scale).2 At the time this requirement represented a severe challenge to the industry as it was 6-1OdB lower than the noise emitted by the then current jets.>>>
<<<The regulations imposed stricter limits on smaller aircraft.>>>
<<<Although smaller aircraft require less powerful engines which would individually produce less noise, the regulations took account of the larger number of movements from such aircraft due to the increased frequency of their associated shorter range operations.>>>
<<<The current noise regulations are illustrated in Fig.>>>
<<<4.5.>>>
<<<To meet the regulations, existing aircraft (engines) were modified by the installation of 'hush kits'.>>>
<<<Such modifications adversely affected the aircraft economics which hastened the introduction of replacement aircraft by quieter and more efficient designs.>>>
<<<Noise is generated when air pressure is rapidly varied.>>>
<<<Such conditions are Take-off path Departure measuring point Runway Sideline measuring point Approach path Arrival measuring point Fig.>>>

<<<naturally created in and around engines due to the changes in pressure and temperature resulting from the generation of power.>>>
<<<The aircraft airframe will also produce noise, particularly in those areas where airflow directions are intentionally varied (e.g.>>>
<<<at control surfaces, high-lift devices, engine intakes), or when projections are immersed in the forward airstream (e.g.>>>
<<<landing gear, airbrakes and lift dumpers), and where there are discontinuities of surface contours (e.g.>>>
<<<over the windscreen, at the edges of the flaps when extended and at badly fitted access panels).>>>
<<<In general, noise generated by the airframe is not significant when engines are at (or near) full throttle but can become important when the engines are throttled back in the approach phase prior to landing.>>>
<<<Whereas in the early days of regulation the noise generated during the take-off and climb-out phases pre- dominated, the development of quiet higher bypass engines and the careful control of aircraft departure flight paths has now focused attention to the approach phase.>>>
<<<B d N P E Low by-pass turbojets without noise suppressors Low by-pass turbojets with noise suppressors Medium by-pass jets High by-pass jets Overall trend line Fig.>>>
<<<4.6 Engine noise (source Rolls Royce data).>>>
<<<Engine by-pass ratio The long shallow (3°) approach path increases the noise exposure to the community under the fixed instrument controlled landing profile.>>>
<<<With the engines at reduced power, airframe noise becomes a more significant component.>>>
<<<In future, designers will need to give more attention to the reduction of aerodynamic noise from the aircraft structure in the landing configuration.>>>
<<<For example, this may require the use of less complex flap designs to achieve the same lift.>>>
<<<Alternatively, pilots may be required to make approaches at a steeper angle (e.g.>>>
<<<5-6°) to increase the height of the aircraft over the community near the start of the runway.>>>
<<<Both these developments will have a significant impact on the design and operation of the aircraft.>>>
<<<As mentioned above, the most significant reduction in engine noise has resulted from the introduction of high bypass ratio engines with large diameter slower speed fan jet streams surrounding the hot exhaust, as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<4.6.>>>
<<<These developments have also altered the noise spectrum.>>>
<<<Figure 4.7 shows that the main sources of noise from the pure jet and low bypass engine is from the hot exhaust gasses as they mix with the ambient airstream.>>>
<<<Noise energy has been estimated as proportional to the seventh power of the exhaust velocity.>>>
<<<It is essential that this velocity is made as slow as possible to reduce noise.>>>
<<<Unfortunately the thrust generated by the engines is proportional to the square of this velocity so a technical compromise must be reached.>>>
<<<More details of this compromise are given in Chapter 9.>>>
<<<The core exhaust velocity can be reduced by mixing slower speed air with the exhaust stream.>>>
<<<Several different types of exhaust nozzle are available, one of which is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<4.8.>>>
<<<In the high bypass engine the mixing is much easier to accomplish.>>>
<<<This results in an average exhaust velocity which is much lower than in the above case.>>>
<<<Where possible, the most effective method for noise reduction is to mix the bypass and core streams internally (within the cowling structure as this Jet efflux Compressor Jet efflux Compressor Inlet Inlet Turbine Compressor Turbine Fan Fan Low by-pass jet High by-pass jet Fig.>>>
<<<4.7 Noise spectrum (source Rolls Royce data).>>>

<<<4.8 Jet efflux (source Rolls Royce data).>>>
<<<can be sound insulated) and then to expel the resulting stream through a mixer nozzle.>>>
<<<The lower velocities and the shorter distance over which the mixing is achieved give a substantial reduction in noise.>>>
<<<This results in the exhaust noise being less dominant than that generated by the fan frequencies.>>>
<<<These noise sources may be partly suppressed within the nacelle structure which will also incorporate sound absorbing materials.>>>
<<<To reduce engine noise intrusion into the fuselage/passenger cabin the engine must be separated from the fuselage side laterally (spanwise) or longitudinally (rear fuselage mounting) and the internal fuselage layout adjusted to position non-seating areas (e.g.>>>
<<<galleys and toilets) at the anticipated noisy cross-sectional planes.>>>
<<<Alternatively, the cabin structures must be sound insulated in these areas and allowance made for the increased weight of fuselage structure that would result.>>>
<<<The above descriptions relate to the control of noise at its source but the operation (flight profile) of the aircraft can have significant influence on the annoyance caused by the aircraft to the population over which it flies.>>>
<<<In order to evaluate these effects there have been a number of noise models created.>>>
<<<The noise 'footprint' from the aircraft and its flight path may be considered in several discrete segments.>>>
<<<The shape of the footprint shows contours of constant noise level.>>>
<<<Figure 4.9 shows the contour for two different sized aircraft together with the airport measuring points (approach A, sideline S, departure D).>>>
<<<Starting at the end of the runway prior to take-off the pilot will select full power from the engine which will be reacted by the brakes (to check the aircraft systems).>>>
<<<This creates the small lateral and rearward lobes on the contour profile at the start of the runway.>>>
<<<On release of the brakes the aircraft will accelerate along the runway creating relatively constant noise contours parallel to the runway.>>>
<<<Due to the shielding of the aircraft offside engines, the noise measurements may be slightly variable.>>>
<<<Sideways noise transmission is more readily attenuated due to natural ground absorption.>>>
<<<When the aircraft lifts off the runway this attenuation is reduced and the noise contours swell laterally due to pure radial noise transmission.>>>
<<<As the aircraft climbs the distance to the noise source from the ground increases and the noise is naturally attenuated in the atmosphere.>>>
<<<This reduces the noise heard on Small aircraft (short-haul, twins) Take-off (departure) Landing (arrival) Runway Fig.>>>

<<<the ground.>>>
<<<The maximum noise occurs when the aircraft is at about 300 m (1000 ft).>>>
<<<To reduce the climb-out noise disturbance some airports impose procedures which require the pilot to reduce thrust (power cutback) after the initial climb phase (as illustrated in Fig.>>>
<<<4.10).>>>
<<<This has the effect of reducing the noise generation at source but reduces the aircraft climbing ability and therefore increases the duration of the exposure.>>>
<<<For the legislators and operators a difficult compromise exists between 'full power' and 'cutback' flight profiles.>>>
<<<When the pilot restores full power the increased noise may generate a noise island downstream from the airport footprint (as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<4.11).>>>
<<<To spread the annoyance, flight path directions may be varied.>>>
<<<This avoids repeated exposure over the same population.>>>
<<<The effect of cutback profiles on the footprint contour is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<4.11.>>>
<<<The noise contours generated by modern high by-pass engines do not show the same advantage for cutback as found on the older turbojets.>>>
<<<This means that it is becoming less effective to use cutback flight profiles as a means of noise abatement except for the noisiest aircraft types.>>>
<<<The noise contours related to the approach path are much easier to define as Thrust curback Lift-off Full power climb Start of take-off Runway Fig.>>>
<<<4.11 Effect of cut-back.>>>
<<<Noise island from thrust increase all aircraft are flying down a fixed ILS (instrument landing system) beam and the engine is at a low thrust setting.>>>
<<<Although the engine noise source is reduced at these settings the aircraft is in an aerodynamic dirty configuration with flaps and eventually landing gear fully deployed.>>>
<<<The approach profile of 3° means that the aircraft flies low over the population for a greater distance.>>>
<<<For this reason the approach noise contour is becoming increasingly significant as mentioned above.>>>
<<<Several attempts have been made to model the noise footprint and to simulate the noise produced at an airport.>>>
<<<One of the most significant models has been developed by the FAA (the Integrated Noise Model, INM).>>>
<<<Several countries have developed similar noise models to assist the planning and development of existing and new airports (e.g.>>>
<<<in the UK the ANCON model and in Denmark the DANSIM model).>>>
<<<From this brief introduction to aircraft noise, it is clear that the design and operation of aircraft is now significantly influenced by noise regulations.>>>
<<<In the past, airframe designers have been able to hide the noise generated from aerodynamic effects of the airframe behind engine generated noise.>>>
<<<The adoption of high by-pass engines, which are intrinsically quieter than earlier engines, will force aircraft designers to consider noise suppression techniques for airframe, particularly in the approach configuration.>>>
<<<The introduction and adoption of Stage 3 noise regulations has resulted in reductions in perceived noise levels at airports over the past years but as more traffic is generated the airport will need to handle more and larger aircraft.>>>
<<<This will eventually increase the noise in the airport community.>>>
<<<These considerations have forced the regulators to consider introducing tougher noise regulations for future aircraft (Stage 3 plus).>>>
<<<The nature of such regulations is not yet finalised but when decisions are made they will have a direct influence on future engine and airframe design.>>>
<<<Considerable improvements can be shown for new aircraft designs compared to older types.>>>
<<<Airbus claim that the A320 is 3OdB quieter than the old 707s (this implies that you would need to have 16 A320s operating together to be considered by the human ear as noisy as one Boeing 707).>>>
<<<The effect of noise decays rapidly with distance from the source.>>>
<<<For this reason other transport systems present serious noise nuisance to the community: 93 dBA - high speed train, 100 m distant 87 dBA - express train, 100 m distant 82 dBA - bus in town, 8 m distant 80 dBA - A320 at take-off, 300 m distant 70 dBA - A320 at take-off, 700 m distant Several textbooks and technical reports are available to allow a more detailed study of the effects of noise.>>>

<<<hydraulic oil) during operation, the predominant source of emissions is from Table 4.3 Flight profile for the LTO cycle Flight mode Duration Thrust setting Idling and taxi-out Take-off Climb-out Approach to land Taxi-in and idle 19min 42 sec 2.2 min 4.0 min 7.0 min 7% 100% 85% 30% 7% the engine exhaust.>>>
<<<Burning jet fuel produces particulates (smoke) and various gases including carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapour (H2O), various oxides of nitrates (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and sulphur dioxide (S2O).>>>
<<<Both CO2 and H2O occur naturally in the atmosphere and are not regarded as harmful.>>>
<<<All the other components are defined as pollutants.>>>
<<<In 1981, ICAO set out recommendations to control the level of acceptable pollutants from aircraft emissions.>>>
<<<To this end, engines are tested at various thrust settings (corresponding to those used in specific flight segments) and the levels of pollutants determined.>>>
<<<These are then used to determine typical emission quantities.>>>
<<<For emission evaluation purposes, the aircraft flight profile is divided into that part occurring below 3000 ft (called the landing - take-off cycle, LTO) and that above (i.e.>>>
<<<the climb and cruise segments).>>>
<<<It is the LTO cycle that has attracted the legislation as this affects the pollution in and around the airport community.>>>
<<<The cycle includes the approach, landing, taxi to stand, taxi from stand, take-off and the initial climb-out phase (from and to 3000 ft).>>>
<<<Each aircraft type produces a particular emission profile in the LTO cycle (i.e.>>>
<<<grams of specific pollutant per kilogram of fuel burnt).>>>
<<<The calculation is based on average duration in each of the segments in the LTO cycle.>>>
<<<The method assumes typical power settings of the engine in each of the manoeuvres.>>>
<<<The specific data is shown in Table 4.3.>>>
<<<Emission data for all aircraft and engines is published by FAA and other regulatory bodies.>>>
<<<Typical emission values (g/kg of fuel) for two different sized aircraft are shown in Table 4.4.>>>

<<<This approxi- mation is acceptable as SO2 only accounts for a small percentage of the total emissions from the engines (see below).>>>
<<<The above data shows that emission quantity and profile vary widely with regard to the type of aircraft (engine) and the mode of operation.>>>
<<<Improvements made by the engine manufacturers from the old engines used on the F28 to the more modern power plants of the B747-400 can clearly be seen in the above data.>>>
<<<By multiplying the fuel flow and duration with the emission production for the B747 the values (grams) shown in Table 4.5 are obtained.>>>
<<<These calculations illustrate the difference in emissions in airborne and ground manoeuvres.>>>
<<<When the aircraft is flying with high power levels, the engines are operating efficiently.>>>
<<<This means that most of the available energy is extracted from the fuel leaving low HC and CO emission but generating high quantities of NOx.>>>
<<<In the ground phase the engines are throttled back and operating at poor combustion conditions.>>>
<<<This produces large amounts of HC and CO. Nearly half of the total amount of these pollutants is generated in the ground phase.>>>
<<<The calculation above shows that about 20 kg of emission products are exhausted by just one B747 aircraft in one LTO cycle.>>>
<<<It has been estimated that millions of tons of pollution are produced by the total air transport industry in each year.>>>
<<<During the LTO cycle, typically 834 kg of fuel will be burnt by the B747 and this will create 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide and about one ton of water vapour.>>>
<<<Emissions during cruise are difficult to estimate because, unlike the LTO cycle conditions, it is difficult to test engines in the rarefied upper atmosphere conditions.>>>
<<<Coupled to this is the variability in operating conditions which affect cruise performance (stage length, aircraft weight, speed and altitude).>>>
<<<The level of pollutant produced will be affected by all these operating conditions.>>>
<<<Nevertheless, it is known that the engines will be operating at the design conditions and this will mean that the combustion process is most efficient.>>>
<<<The legislators, recognising these facts and noting the intention of engine manufacturers to produce optimum design during cruise conditions, have chosen not to set requirements in this phase (i.e.>>>

<<<On the contrary, it is suspected that high flying aircraft (e.g.>>>

<<<Current modern aircraft require about half the fuel to fly a short range sector (500 nm) as older (1970) types.>>>
<<<This large improvement over the past 20 years has come about due to a combination of engine, airframe and operating practices.>>>
<<<Several textbooks and reports are available which provide fuller explanations of aircraft emissions.>>>
<<<A good place to start is a report by L. J. Archer.3 Ecology Although the air transport industry has made considerable efforts over the past 20 years to reduce noise and emissions, the future is likely to be no less demanding on environmental issues.>>>
<<<Legislation may be introduced that places an increasing burden on the use of fuel (e.g.>>>
<<<carbon taxes) and imposes even tighter operating restrictions to reduce the annoyance due to noise and emissions.>>>
<<<These will have considerable effects on the way that aircraft and engines are designed and operated.>>>
<<<New considerations regarding the necessity to use renewable (recyclable) materials and the need to avoid wastage during operations (e.g.>>>
<<<fuel spillage) may be forthcoming.>>>
<<<The only certainty is that the industry must be, and be seen to be, responsive to all reasonable ecological pressures that arise.>>>
<<<One of the principal considerations to future operations may arise from the restriction of airport development due to strong ecological pressure groups protecting green field sites and changes to land-use.>>>
<<<This may have considerable influence on aircraft design and operation as it may become increasingly desirable to reduce occupancy of the scarce runway area; for example aircraft may need to be designed for steeper approach flight paths and to land at slower speeds than existing practice.>>>
<<<Existing environmental issues and new considerations place a considerable burden on aircraft design teams.>>>
<<<They must be politically and socially aware of these pressures and be prepared to respond to genuine issues.>>>
<<<Past experience has shown that such demands on the design of new aircraft can be met by the emergence of new technologies and operating practices.>>>
<<<It is to be hoped that this can be continued into the future.>>>

<<<The chapter also considers other factors that must be taken into account for the full design of the fuselage.>>>
<<<These include the shaping of the front and rear sections to blend into the cabin geometry, providing accommodation for the flight crew, housing cargo and freight in standard containers and the provision of structural support for the wing and tail surfaces (and possibly rear engines).>>>
<<<To provide a comfortable and safe environment for the occupants the fuselage design also requires several systems to be specified.>>>
<<<These range from the flight deck avionics and displays to the passenger cabin conditioning systems.>>>
<<<An introduction to these systems is given towards the end of the chapter.>>>
<<<The description of fuselage layout and design concludes with an example of fuselage layout on a proposed new aircraft.>>>
<<<This shows how the principles described in this chapter can be applied to a specific design philosophy.>>>
<<<After you have studied this chapter you will be able to set out the geometry of a fuselage to meet the aircraft specification and will appreciate the systems needed to support the overall design.>>>
<<<Passenger preferences One of the principal purposes of air transport is to carry people comfortably and safely over the journey they want to make.>>>
<<<The cabin interior more than any other feature on the aircraft will be carefully assessed by the customer.>>>
<<<It is therefore essential that the starting point for a good layout must be the detail design of the passenger cabin.>>>
<<<Although ticket price and journey time may be the main factors in choosing to make the flight, the passenger when boarding the aircraft is making secondary judgements on the comfort and standard of service offered by the airline.>>>
<<<The airline therefore pays particular attention to the interior design of the cabin.>>>
<<<The aircraft manufacturer will normally supply the new aircraft without cabin decoration.>>>
<<<Each airline arranges to fit-out the interior of the passenger cabin to match their corporate identity and style.>>>
<<<The passenger will assess the environment aboard the aircraft in different ways.>>>
<<<Emotional • Does it meet with expectations and is it aesthetically pleasing?>>>
<<<• Does it feel friendly, efficient and safe?>>>
<<<Physical • Is it tidy?>>>
<<<• Is the air conditioning efficient?>>>
<<<• Is the cabin odour free?>>>

<<<5.1 Perceived passenger comfort with journey time.>>>
<<<Trip duration (hours) All these requirements and expectations must be met within the technical constraints of the aircraft.>>>
<<<A classical compromise must be struck between the provision of sufficient space and cabin service to make the passengers feel comfortable during the flight and the minimisation of the fuselage size to reduce structural weight and aerodynamic drag.>>>
<<<Fortunately, the circular cross-section of the conventional fuselage matches the requirements of optimum enclosed volume, minimum structural weight and minimum wetted area (i.e.>>>
<<<lowest drag).>>>
<<<The amount of space required by travellers to feel comfortable is directly related to journey time.>>>
<<<Several years ago, some American researchers conducted tests to find out how passengers perceived comfort levels relative to journey time.>>>
<<<Their results are diagrammatically presented in Fig.>>>
<<<5.1.>>>
<<<From our own travelling experiences we know that we can tolerate cramped conditions for a short time but for longer periods we need more space.>>>
<<<It is this effect that makes travelling in first class compartments feel so much more comfortable than in the cheaper tourist section.>>>
<<<Likewise, for a similar level of comfort it is possible to provide less space to those travellers lucky enough to fly supersonically and thereby get to their destination in half the normal flight time.>>>
<<<The provision of cabin services is also dependent on journey time (Fig.>>>
<<<5.2).>>>
<<<For short trips a comfortable seat may be all that is required but for long journeys recreation, entertainment and social space are necessary.>>>
<<<Unfortunately, most of these passenger facilities add weight to the aircraft.>>>
<<<This means that aircraft on long distance flights require more service weight provision that those on short journeys.>>>
<<<As competition for revenue increases the requirement for comfort enhancing features will grow and this will need to be reflected in new aircraft designs.>>>

<<<5.2 Passenger service needs with journey time.>>>
<<<Passenger cabin layout Two geometrical parameters specify the passenger cabin (diameter and length).>>>
<<<Of these the cabin diameter is the most critical because once fixed it is impractical to change.>>>
<<<On the other hand, part of the natural development programme of the aircraft will be to stretch the fuselage by adding extra length ('plugs') to increase capacity.>>>
<<<Cabin cross-section The shape of the fuselage cross-section is dictated by the structural requirements for pressurisation.>>>
<<<A circular shell reacts the internal pressure loads by hoop tension.>>>
<<<This makes the circular section efficient and therefore lowest in structural weight.>>>
<<<Any non-circular shape will impose bending stresses in the shell structure.>>>
<<<This will add considerable weight to the fuselage structure.>>>
<<<However, a fully circular section may not be the best shape to enclose the payload as it may give too much unusable volume above or below the cabin space.>>>
<<<On some designs this problem has been overcome by the use of several interconnecting circular sections to form the cross-sectional layout.>>>
<<<Figure 5.3 shows three non-circular fuselage shapes.>>>
<<<The Boeing 747 (a) incorporates a smaller radius arc on the upper deck to provide adequate headroom to the top cabin.>>>
<<<The upper and lower radii are blended with a short straight section near the upper floor position.>>>
<<<In the proposal for a new large aircraft (b) the same principle is used but the blend is made with a circular arc section.>>>
<<<A radical Airbus proposal (c) overcomes the double-deck problem by the use of a horizontal double-bubble.>>>
<<<Structural and operational problems have led to most of the multi-arc sections being discarded.>>>
<<<(The rectangular areas under the lower floors in Fig.>>>
<<<5.3 represent the cargo containers which must also be considered when deciding the best shape of fuselage section.)>>>
<<<(a) (b) (C) Fig.>>>
<<<5.3 Multi-arc fuselage sections.>>>
<<<To balance the hoop tension loads in the skin of multi-arc sections, the intersection points of the different radii are required to be connected to transverse members.>>>
<<<In most cases this balancing structure is used for the floor support as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.3.>>>
<<<Although the multi-arc sections may be regarded as feasible for the cylindrical cabin section care must be taken with the geometry as these need to be blended forward and aft into the nose and tail structures without causing drag raising profiles.>>>
<<<The determination of cabin cross-sectional shape and size is one of the first detail design studies to be undertaken on a new project.>>>
<<<The overall size must be kept small to reduce aircraft weight and drag, yet the resulting shape must provide a comfortable and flexible cabin interior which will appeal to the customer airlines.>>>
<<<The main decision to be taken is the choice of number of seats across the aircraft and the consequential aisle arrangement.>>>
<<<For a specified number of passengers, the number of seats across will fix the number of rows in the cabin and thereby the fuselage length.>>>
<<<The length-to-diameter parameter (sometimes referred to as the fuselage fineness ratio) is an influential factor in the design of the fuselage, as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.4.>>>
<<<A low ratio (leading to a stubby fuselage shape) will result in a drag penalty but will offer potential for future stretch.>>>
<<<A high fineness ratio gives a long thin tubular structure which may suffer from dynamic structural instability and will restrict future developments (stretch).>>>
<<<Selection of fuselage diameter is further complicated by the need to provide different ticket classes in the aircraft.>>>
<<<The 'first-class' passenger will be given (and expect) more personal space, larger seat dimensions and better services than the cheaper 'business-class' passenger who in turn will expect more than is provided for the 'economy-class'.>>>
<<<Three-class layouts are common in most scheduled long- haul services and two classes are provided on short to medium range flights.>>>
<<<For commuter, leisure and charter operation single class layouts are commonly used.>>>
<<<Charter operators often adopt layouts that are more cramped than scheduled economy-class services.>>>
<<<In general, first- and business-class compartments will have fewer seats across the aircraft and more aisle width than the economy or charter layouts.>>>
<<<In order to maximise the market for the aircraft the cabin designers need to consider the sectional layouts for each class plus the opportunity to meet charter configurations.>>>

<<<6 abreast layout (210 seats) layout options available within the cabin section are determined.>>>
<<<Aircraft manufacturers are careful to take advice on the operational layout requirements from potential customers before selecting the fuselage cross-sectional shape as once it is fixed it is difficult to alter.>>>
<<<The review of existing cross-sectional shapes shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.5 may be used to suggest the first guess of the fuselage sectional layout.>>>
<<<Note, in Fig.>>>
<<<5.5 the larger aircraft use the space below the floor to hold freight containers.>>>
<<<The size of these containers is standardised to allow use on different aircraft types.>>>
<<<Some current layouts are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.6.>>>
<<<To load freight and baggage into the aircraft the goods are packaged onto pallets or put into containers.>>>
<<<The major airlines use containers that are designed for their own aircraft and ground handling equipment.>>>
<<<The most common arrangement puts the cargo in the lower holds (below cabin floor), as shown above but cargo can be loaded onto the main deck as an alternative to the seats as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.7.>>>
<<<Loading into the lower deck holds may require containers that are shaped to give clearance to the sides of the lower fuselage profile as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<Figure 5.8 illustrates various layout options to suit a 229 inch (5817 mm) floor width (ref.>>>

<<<Some airlines install a seat which is designed to be convertible from a double in first/business layout to a triple unit for economy.>>>
<<<In these cases the aisle width will be dictated by the non-tourist configuration.>>>
<<<The advantage of this type of seat lies in the flexibility it provides to change the ratio of seats in the various classes.>>>

<<<On some designs the space generated by moving the seat away from the fuselage side allows extra floor mounted storage lockers to be positioned to the outside of the window seats.>>>
<<<Cabin length Once the cabin cross-section has been decided, the number of seats across the cabin will be fixed.>>>
<<<Dividing this number into the total number of seats in each class gives the average number of rows of seats to be installed.>>>
<<<The required cabin length will be related to the leg-room provided for each class.>>>

<<<It is obviously impractical to make the seat pitch variable with the actual seat unit as airlines prefer straight rows across the cabin to simplify servicing (passenger management, serving food, cleaning, etc.>>>
<<<)- The seat pitch is chosen by the operator within the ranges shown in Table 5.3 (for comparison bus/coach seats are pitched at about 725 mm).>>>
<<<The number of seats to be provided in each class is dependent on the type of operation and the demand for tickets in each class.>>>
<<<The type of operation may vary due to seasonal demand for air travel.>>>
<<<In the summer months there will be more demand for the cheaper seats from the holiday market, in the winter the total demand may fall but the business demand will not reduce proportionately.>>>
<<<This means that the split of seats between the various classes varies throughout the year.>>>
<<<Airlines may need to reconfigure the cabin layout to suit the demand pattern (e.g.>>>
<<<winter and summer operations).>>>
<<<Seats and internal partitions must be easily moved to avoid long change-over times.>>>
<<<Rails running along the length of the cabin floor are used to hold the seat and partitions with sufficient security to meet the crash load conditions specified in the airworthiness regulations.>>>
<<<All the various seating arrangements must be consistent with the lateral position of these rails, as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.8.>>>
<<<The total number of passengers that can be accommodated in the cabin will be limited by the aircraft maximum take-off weight limit.>>>
<<<This is set by structural, aerodynamic and performance criteria and not related to the interior arrangement.>>>
<<<Also, the cabin capacity may be limited by the type and number of emergency exits provided (e.g.>>>
<<<see FAR 25.807 for full details).>>>
<<<This may also restrict the maximum number of seats in the high-capacity charter role.>>>
<<<In order to fix the initial layout, an estimate of the proportion of passengers in each class has to be made.>>>
<<<Evidence should be collected from aircraft of the same type and operated on similar routes as the proposed design.>>>
<<<Typically for a three- class layout there will be 8% first, 13% business and 79% economy seats.>>>
<<<Different arrangements of seats will be possible within a fixed cabin length.>>>
<<<It is important for the project design team to identify the special requirements for each airline to satisfy the overall layout.>>>
<<<Figure 5.11 shows how a fixed cabin length can be arranged to give different seating for three-, two-, and single-class options.>>>
<<<Note how the fixed cabin facilities (toilets and galleys) in this design have been cleverly positioned to act as partitions between the different compartments.>>>

<<<The layout options will be carefully studied by the airlines to find a match for their market variations.>>>
<<<In the layouts in Fig.>>>
<<<5.11, the 300 and 400 seat aircraft will permit more fuel to be loaded (up to the design maximum aircraft take-off weight).>>>
<<<This will allow the aircraft to fly further.>>>
<<<This trade-off between seats and range is one of the main parameters that the airline will use to assess the suitability of the design to their route patterns.>>>
<<<The balance between passengers and range forms the basis of the payload-range diagram for the aircraft as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.12.>>>
<<<Extra seats must be provided for the cabin attendants.>>>
<<<The number of attendants is left to the discretion of the airline but must be sufficient to control passenger evacuation in an emergency and satisfy the licensing authority.>>>
<<<The number of stewards is set by the airline to provide prompt service to the passengers.>>>
<<<Typically, one attendant per 30-40 passengers is chosen for the economy class, one for 20-25 in business and one for 10-15 in first class.>>>
<<<The attendants will be provided with 'flip-up' seats for use during the take-off and landing phases.>>>
<<<These are generally positioned in the vicinity of the emergency exit and on other doors.>>>
<<<Service facilities (including galleys, toilets and wardrobes) must be provided in the cabin layout.>>>
<<<These must be positioned to suit the proposed seating layouts.>>>

<<<It is not possible to quickly alter the position of these facilities although some units may be interchangeable.>>>
<<<The provision of galley and toilet facilities is left to the operator.>>>
<<<The number of each type is matched to the passenger capacity.>>>
<<<For example, short-haul flights will require less galley service than long-haul flights.>>>
<<<For an aircraft used for both long-haul and short-haul operations there will be more seats in the short-haul configuration and this will set the requirement for toilets and possibly galleys.>>>
<<<The number of passengers for each facility is related to the ticket class with typically between 10 and 60 passengers for each galley and 15-40 passengers for each toilet (the lower numbers for first-class accom- modation).>>>
<<<The position of these units must not interfere with movement of passengers during loading or disembarkation.>>>

<<<Cargo space Although the accommodation of passengers is the principal concern of the fuselage designer, it is also important to provide sufficient and convenient cargo space.>>>

<<<It is usual to provide passenger doors on the left (port) side of the aircraft which leaves access on the right side for aircraft servicing (catering, toilet cleaning, baggage handling, etc.).>>>
<<<Fuselage geometry Once the internal details have been settled it is necessary to complete the external shape of the fuselage.>>>
<<<The passenger cabin and associated under-floor cargo holds will be contained in a cylindrical shell.>>>
<<<The external skin will need to be slightly larger in size than the interior space to allow for the fuselage structural framework, internal decoration and soundproofing panels.>>>
<<<A thickness of 100-140 mm will be added around the internal profile to provide space for the fuselage structure, etc.>>>
<<<The cylindrical section will be streamlined (faired) in front and behind the cabin.>>>
<<<The addition of these shapes to the central section will complete the fuselage profile.>>>
<<<Front fuselage At the front of the cabin the fuselage has to be streamlined to reduce drag.>>>
<<<The front fuselage accommodates the forward-looking radar in the nose section, the flight deck with associated windscreen, and the nose undercarriage.>>>
<<<The flight deck layout naturally revolves around the working environment for the flight crew.>>>
<<<Anthropometric data for flight crews has provided the basis for the arrangement of pilots' seats, instruments and controls.>>>
<<<Apart from a comfortable seating arrangement, the flight deck must be suitable for the display of information to the pilots and to allow them to make the appropriate control responses to fly the aircraft safely.>>>
<<<The development of electronic displays has transformed the traditional layout of the flight deck.>>>
<<<Figure 5.16 shows a typical arrangement.>>>
<<<The overall length of the flight deck varies according to aircraft type from about 110 inches (2.75 m) for smaller aircraft to 150 inches (3.75 m) for larger types.>>>
<<<The larger space can accommodate an extra (third) flight crew member if required by the operators.>>>
<<<The pilot's seat and controls must be adjustable to suit pilots between 5 ft 2 in (1.55 m) and 6 ft 3 in (1.88 m) in height and thereby to allow the pilot's eye to be positioned at the vision datum.>>>
<<<The aircraft must be capable of being flown from either pilot seat position; therefore the windscreen and front geometry will be symmetrical about the aircraft longitudinal centreline.>>>
<<<The pilot must have good visibility, in all flight and ground manoeuvres.>>>
<<<He should be able to see below the horizon in the approach attitude and at least 10° below the horizon when climbing.>>>
<<<In turning flight he should be able to see upwards at about 20° and sideways 110°.>>>
<<<On the ground the pilot must be able to see the aircraft wing tips (albeit this may mean that he has to lean forward and sideways).>>>
<<<The arrangement of instruments and controls is standardised to avoid pilot confusion in an emergency but with the introduction of synthetic displays some of the detailed arrangements are subject to airline preferences.>>>
<<<The nose wheel and leg will be stored (retracted) into a non-pressurised bay below the flight deck or on small aircraft partially between the pilot seat positions.>>>
<<<Forward of the pressure bulkhead an equipment bay is provided.>>>
<<<This will include the forward-looking weather radar system and storage for other avionics equipment.>>>
<<<Access to this space will be necessary to service the systems.>>>
<<<An external door or panel is usually provided and the most forward section is made from radar transparent material.>>>
<<<Modern 'glass' cockpit displays and side-stick controllers have transformed the layout of the flight deck from the traditional aircraft configuration.>>>
<<<Airworthiness regulations specify the external vision requirements and thereby the window layout necessary for the fuselage profile.>>>
<<<The front fuselage profile presents a classical design comprise between a smooth shape for low drag and the need to have flat sloping windows to give good visibility.>>>
<<<Although the airworthiness requirements for the window area are the same for all aircraft, the designers have sufficient creativity to make the front fuselage profile distinctive between different manufacturers.>>>
<<<The layout of the flight deck and specified pilot window geometry is often the starting point of the overall fuselage layout.>>>
<<<Rear fuselage The rear fuselage profile is chosen to provide a smooth, low drag shape which supports the tail surfaces and in some configurations the rear engine installation.>>>
<<<The lower side of the profile must provide adequate clearance for aircraft to rotate Co-pilot's seat Rudder pedals Equipment racks Front pressure bulkhead Captain's seat Flight inspector's seat Crew wardrobe Pilot eye datum Max upward view Horizontal view line Max down view Instrument panel Forward equipment bay with weather radar Fig.>>>

<<<Initial flight tests will be used to demonstrate that maximum rotation angles are possible at the minimum unstick speed.>>>
<<<In most designs the cabin layout will be arranged to extend into the rear fuselage, terminating in a hemispherical pressure bulkhead.>>>
<<<The reduced cabin dimension in this area means that the standard seat arrangement may need to be altered.>>>
<<<Often services (e.g.>>>
<<<galley, toilets and storage units) are positioned in the area.>>>
<<<In aircraft configurations which require access to the fuselage for freight loading the rear and front fuselage profiles and the associated structural framework will be compromised by the installation of large doors and loading ramps.>>>
<<<Airworthiness For commercial operation most of the airworthiness regulations are aimed at preventing accidents.>>>
<<<However, even with the best efforts of aeronautical engineers and operators the aircraft may crash.>>>
<<<In such an event it is the responsibility of the fuselage designers to ensure that the passengers are given protection during and immediately after the accident and that they can quickly and safely evacuate the fuselage.>>>
<<<The designers have often more than one option for the design of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Crashworthiness and evacuation criteria must be considered when making decisions on fuselage layout (see also Chapter 4).>>>
<<<Aircraft accidents vary from non-survivable crashes (e.g.>>>
<<<mid-air collisions) to small knocks against airport equipment on the airport stand.>>>
<<<Apart from careful air traffic control and by making aircraft more visible there is little that the designers can do to protect the passengers in non-survivable crashes.>>>
<<<Fortunately such accidents are rare and most crashes are survivable.>>>
<<<In such accidents the deceleration forces experienced by the occupants are tolerable and the damaged fuselage structure and equipment does not cause injury to the occupants.>>>
<<<Improving crashworthiness of the aircraft will increase the severity of the crash which will be survivable.>>>
<<<Crashworthiness One of the main requirements for crashworthiness is to provide a protective envelope around the passengers.>>>
<<<The stressed skin pressurised cylindrical fuselage usually contains enough strength to provide this feature.>>>
<<<However, crash dynamics often exhibit low sink rates and either nose-up or tail-down impact with the ground.>>>
<<<This causes substantial bending forces along the length of the fuselage.>>>
<<<These frequently fracture the shell at sections with large shear inputs (e.g.>>>
<<<wing mountings) breaking the fuselage into several sections.>>>
<<<To offer the best protection to passengers it would be advisable to: • avoid seating in the areas that are likely to fracture in a crash; • avoid (if possible) seating passengers over those areas with stiff understructure (e.g.>>>
<<<wing /undercarriage) as these areas will have less energy absorbing characteristics; • reinforce the fuselage section below a high wing layout but ensure a crushable (energy absorbent) structure is maintained; • increase space between seats but ensure that the passenger is securely held into the seat and that other items do not intrude into the seating area; • use aft-facing seats or use upper torso support to restrain head, neck and body; • avoid seating passengers in areas likely to be intruded by components in an accident (e.g.>>>
<<<propeller/fan disc, engine nacelle undercarriage); • use seat structures that are strong enough to meet the crash loading specified in airworthiness regulations but also have controlled collapsible features to reduce the peak acceleration felt by the occupant.>>>
<<<Obviously, some of these guidelines must be compromised in the light of the overall design of the aircraft and other safety considerations.>>>
<<<Apart from the crash considerations described above the interior of the aircraft must offer a safe environment to the passengers.>>>
<<<This means that all loose equipment (including carry-on luggage) must be stored in lockable cupboards, that the interior trim is fire and smoke resistant and that essential safety equipment (e.g.>>>
<<<oxygen, life rafts, evacuation chutes) is provided.>>>
<<<If possible the aircraft structure and configuration must avoid the risk of fuel spillage in the crash especially if it could get into the cabin area or if it makes the escape routes dangerous.>>>
<<<Assuming that the occupants have survived the crash, the fuselage layout must also allow safe and rapid evacuation.>>>
<<<The criteria are described below.>>>
<<<Evacuation Emergency evacuation of the cabin plays an important part in deciding the fuselage layout.>>>
<<<Before a certificate of airworthiness is granted to the type, the manufacturer will be expected to demonstrate to the airworthiness authorities that all occupants can vacate the aircraft in 90 seconds or less using the emergency equipment normally carried.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations state precisely the minimum number and type of emergency exits to be provided in the cabin structure.>>>
<<<These must be positioned each side of the fuselage.>>>
<<<Doors used for services (e.g.>>>
<<<galley replenishment, toilet servicing, etc.)>>>
<<<may be classed as emergency exits providing they can ensure unobstructed access during emergencies.>>>
<<<The position of these doors for emergency evacuation may fix the location of the service units in the cabin.>>>
<<<Exits not used for passenger loading or service (e.g.>>>
<<<over-wing exits) will also require extra space to avoid congestion during evacuation.>>>
<<<Cabin windows are often placed in emergency exit structures.>>>
<<<The need to make more space available in these areas conflicts with equal seat spacing in the cabin.>>>
<<<(Note: in general, the windows are positioned to suit the fuselage structural frame geometry and not chosen to match the seat row geometry as the internal arrangement of seats may be changed to match different operations: e.g.>>>
<<<seasonal variations in traffic.)>>>
<<<Doors and emergency exits are heavy and complicated structures.>>>
<<<Designers will specify the number, position and sizes of these exits at the preliminary stage of the project.>>>
<<<As mentioned earlier, the cabin layout options may be limited to match the number and type of emergency exits provided (e.g.>>>
<<<see FAR 25.807 for full details).>>>
<<<The minimum number of exits to be provided is related to the maximum number of seats.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations set out the precise requirements.>>>
<<<In these regu- lations the type of exit is specified according to the size of the opening (inches): 24 wide x 48 high (610x1219 mm) Type I Type III 20 wide x 36 high (508 x 914 mm) Type A 42 wide x 72 high (1067 x 1829 mm) Type II Type IV 19 wide x 26 high (483 x 660 mm) 20 wide x 44 high (508 x 1118 mm) (The Type A exit is equivalent to a passenger or service loading door.)>>>
<<<Table 5.4 (from airworthiness regulations) specifies the minimum number and type of exits to be provided on each side of the fuselage.>>>
<<<For capacities greater than 179, a pair (one each side of the aircraft) of additional Type A exits will allow an extra 110 seats, a pair of Type I exits will allow an extra 45 seats.>>>
<<<Above 300 seat capacity all exits must be of Type A; for example, a new large aircraft with 600 seats will require six Type A exits on each side of the fuselage.>>>
<<<As mentioned above, to give uncongested access to these doors in an emergency, the internal cabin layout near these exits must provide more space than in other parts of the cabin.>>>

<<<Environmental systems will be essential to make the passengers safe and comfortable.>>>
<<<Passengers need protection from outside air which is at a temperature of minus 500C or less, a pressure less than 30% of the sea level value, and with insufficient oxygen to sustain life.>>>
<<<It would be possible to pressurise the fuselage to an equivalent sea level condition but this would impose high hoop tension loads in the fuselage skin (requiring a thicker and heavier shell structure).>>>
<<<To reduce these loads a compromise is necessary.>>>
<<<The cabin environment is conditioned to a higher equivalent altitude than sea level.>>>
<<<This reduces these stresses.>>>
<<<The equivalent altitude is kept low enough to make the passengers feel comfortable.>>>
<<<For most commercial flights the cabin height is set at an equivalent altitude of about 8000 ft (as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.18).>>>
<<<The structure will be designed to a specified differential pressure loading and the pumping system will have a maximum pressurisation/depressurisation rate.>>>
<<<The passengers will require an air conditioning system that will provide comfortable room temperature and freshness in the cabin.>>>
<<<When the aircraft is in the cold environment of the high altitude the conditioning system will bleed hot air from the engine compressors to use as the heat source.>>>
<<<On the other hand, when the aircraft is on the ground in hot climates, the cabin conditioning system will need to extract heat to cool the cabin environment.>>>
<<<The cabin services put a high demand on the aircraft electrical system.>>>
<<<The provision of lighting, illuminated signs and entertainment throughout the cabin requires careful positioning of electrical looms and internal panelling.>>>

<<<Fuselage layout exercise Assume that you are working in the advanced project office and your manager has asked you to size the fuselage of a new 300 seat aircraft.>>>
<<<The marketing strategy for the new aircraft is to offer more comfort to the passenger than is given by current designs.>>>
<<<The aircraft is designed to travel on medium to long stage routes having a maximum range of 4000 nm with full payload.>>>
<<<Answer From Fig.>>>
<<<5.5 a conventional 300 seat aircraft would have nine seats across in the economy configuration.>>>
<<<A typical layout for nine abreast with twin aisles is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.8 (a 2-5-2 arrangement of seats).>>>
<<<From the same diagram a more comfortable seating arrangement would offer eight abreast (2-4-2) in the business class.>>>
<<<This avoids the undesirable middle seat in the five seat unit for the con- ventional economy configuration.>>>
<<<The nine abreast seating in the 229 in (5817 mm) width layout shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.8 provides only a 19.5 in (495 mm) aisle width.>>>
<<<This is regarded as somewhat tight for a comfortable cabin; therefore the minimum aisle width will be increased to 20.5 in (521mm).>>>
<<<This increases the overall internal width of the cabin to 231 in (5867 mm).>>>
<<<The fuselage structural framework must enclose the cabin.>>>
<<<Allowing for the necessary shell structure and the internal decorative panelling a cabin wall thickness of four inches is required.>>>
<<<This gives an external diameter of 239 in (6.07 m).>>>
<<<From published data of other aircraft it is possible to compare fuselage diameters, as shown in Table 5.5.>>>
<<<Our chosen cross-sectional layout is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.19.>>>
<<<The business/first seats are each 29 in (737 mm) wide and the aisles are 28.5 in (724mm).>>>
<<<The economy seats are 23.75 in (603 mm) wide and the aisles are 20.5 in (521 mm).>>>
<<<For a 300 seat aircraft about 20% of the seats will be in the non-economy class.>>>
<<<As we are providing business-class space for the economy passengers we will need to upgrade the business section to six abreast seating (2-2-2) and to extend the facilities/space beyond current standards for the first-class customers.>>>

<<<First/business cabin Economy cabin Fig.>>>
<<<5.19 Example aircraft section choice.>>>
<<<We can now determine the number of rows of seats required for each of the eight and six abreast sections of the cabin: Economy-class seats (eight abreast) = 80% of 300 = 240 seats (eight seats across the cabin gives exactly 30 rows) first/business-class seats (six abreast) = 20% of 300 = 60 seats (six seats across gives exactly 10 rows) For this type of aircraft the normal seat pitch for economy class is 32 in (813 mm).>>>
<<<This will be increased to 36 in (914 mm) to match the project design philosophy.>>>
<<<Correspondingly, the business-class passengers would currently expect 38 in (965 mm) pitch.>>>
<<<This will be increased to 40 in (1016 mm) pitch.>>>
<<<To provide a first-class compartment upgraded from the current standard, two rows of business-class seats will be extended to 60 in (1524 mm) seat pitch.>>>
<<<This will Overall cabin length 162 feet Flight deck Services (galley, toilet, wardrobe) Economy 15 rows of 36 inches pitch Business 8 rows of 40 inches pitch First class 2 rows of 60 inches pitch Fig.>>>

<<<Hence the total length of the cabin seating is: economy = 30 seat rows @ 36 in pitch = 1080 (27.43 m) business = 8 seat rows @ 40 in pitch = 320 (8.13 m) = 120 (3.05 m) first = 2 seat rows @ 60 in pitch total = 1520 (126.7 ft = 38.6 m) The cabin length must include the service areas (catering, toilets and wardrobes) and some 'lost' space must be expected around entrances and emergency exits.>>>
<<<From the layouts shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.11, an estimate of 35 ft (10.5 m) is made for this passenger capacity.>>>
<<<This makes the overall cabin length approximately 162 ft (49 m).>>>
<<<We can assume that some of the extra cabin length is accounted in the non- cylindrical parts of the fuselage shape (i.e.>>>
<<<forward and behind the main cabin section).>>>
<<<We will assume that the total length is divided as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<5.20.>>>
<<<Forward of the cabin the front fuselage will house the flight deck, equipment bay, etc.>>>
<<<This will account for approximately 20 ft extra length.>>>
<<<The fuselage shape behind the cabin will be longer than the front section as it supports the tail surfaces.>>>
<<<These need to be at sufficient distance from the wing to provide adequate stability and control.>>>
<<<The fuselage shape forward and aft of the passenger cabin will add about 50 ft (15.24m) to the fuselage length.>>>
<<<The aircraft side view will therefore appear as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<The overall length of the example aircraft is therefore expected to be: (162 + 20 + 50) = 232 ft (70.7 m) From published data the fuselage lengths of some existing aircraft can be compared, as shown in Table 5.6.>>>
<<<The analysis above shows that it will be necessary to add about 8 m to the length of a conventional fuselage to give a better level of comfort in the cabin.>>>
<<<This extension will have the effect of increasing the fuselage structure mass and wetted area.>>>
<<<Both of these reduce the range the aircraft can fly within the maximum take- off weight.>>>
<<<In the following chapters methods are presented that will enable you to quantify the mass and drag of the aircraft and to conduct performance calculations to determine this loss of range if you want to take this study project further.>>>
<<<Wing and tail layout Objectives This chapter describes how the wing and tail surfaces are defined by aero- dynamic, stability/control, layout and structural requirements.>>>
<<<The size of the wing (area) will usually be dictated by aircraft performance requirements (e.g.>>>
<<<field length) but the shape of the planform and other geometry may be influenced by wing layout factors.>>>
<<<In the early design stages choices need to be made on the position of the wing relative to the fuselage (e.g.>>>
<<<high, mid or low position) and then on the overall envelope.>>>
<<<This will include selection of aspect ratio, taper ratio, sweepback angle, thickness ratio and section profile, and dihedral.>>>
<<<Each of these decisions is explained so that you could set out the shape of your preferred planform.>>>
<<<Civil aircraft normally have flaps and high-lift devices installed in the wing geometry.>>>
<<<Although the aerodynamic (lift and drag) characteristics of flaps are described in Chapter 8, a brief introduction is included in the section on flap design so that these can be added to your wing layout.>>>
<<<This chapter provides the baseline shape of the wing which will be refined by more detailed analysis later in the design process.>>>
<<<The parametric design techniques by which this is done are explained in Chapter 13.>>>
<<<The shape of the tail surfaces (horizontal and vertical) are not only influenced by the same parameters as wing design but also need to provide safe handling qualities to the aircraft.>>>
<<<To ensure such safety involves detailed stability and control calculations but these require a knowledge of the geometry of the tail surfaces.>>>
<<<To start the process it is necessary to make a sensible choice of tail shape.>>>
<<<This chapter describes how this may be done at the initial project design phase.>>>
<<<After reading this chapter, and with a knowledge of the chosen wing area, you should be able to size the wing and tail surfaces which together with the fuselage layout will allow you to make an initial drawing of the aircraft.>>>
<<<In the conceptual design phase of the project an estimate of wing area and a crude guess at the wing shape are made.>>>
<<<As the design progresses to the more detailed design phases it is necessary to carefully consider the wing geometry to obtain the shape which is optimum for the missions envisaged.>>>
<<<Although the wing cannot be considered in isolation from the other components on the aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<engine installation, empennage layout, noise) it is essential to concentrate on the main wing parameters in the early stages of the layout and to consider the overall factors that are dictated by the aircraft configuration/specification later in the design process.>>>
<<<The main wing design parameters can be identified under four headings: • performance requirements • flying qualities • structural framework • internal volume Performance requirements the wing necessary The performance requirements will have to be considered in the conceptual phase.>>>
<<<The size of (airworthiness) requirements and the design (specification) requirements will need to be evaluated.>>>
<<<Certain climb rates and operating speeds will be laid down in the airworthiness requirements.>>>
<<<The design requirements will specify the field length and cruise speeds.>>>
<<<the mandatory to meet Flying qualities Ensuring that the aircraft flight handling qualities are acceptable will affect the choice of wing geometry (e.g.>>>
<<<wing planform will dictate the stall and post-stall behaviour of the aircraft at low speed).>>>
<<<The design requirements will specify the field length and cruise speeds.>>>
<<<At high speed, aeroelasticity and aerodynamic buffet will be criteria to be considered.>>>
<<<Vehicle ride will be affected by the gust responsive- ness of the wing but this may be alleviated by automatic flight control systems coupled to wing surface controls.>>>
<<<For control and stability, dutch roll and lateral response will be important parameters.>>>
<<<Again these may be beneficially influenced by the aircraft automatic flight control systems.>>>
<<<The influence of wing planform on flying quality is difficult to predict and often results in 'fixes' to correct inherent deficiencies.>>>
<<<Structural framework The main criteria for structural considerations are safety and minimum weight.>>>
<<<The wing structural framework must support all the non-wing components (e.g.>>>
<<<engine, undercarriage), house all the flying controls and the high-lift devices (e.g.>>>
<<<ailerons, flaps, airbrakes, etc.).>>>
<<<Within all these requirements, the wing must be easy to manufacture and simple to maintain throughout its full service life.>>>
<<<Internal volume The internal volume of the wing should be sufficient to hold the required fuel, (in separate tanks), the landing gear (if retracted into the wing profile) and the high-lift devices and other controls.>>>
<<<Wing layout One of the first considerations on the conventional monoplane arrangement with which we are concerned is the wing placement relative to the fuselage.>>>
<<<The choice lies between high-, mid- or low-wing positions.>>>
<<<In each case there are structural and aerodynamic considerations along with effects on engine ground clearance, undercarriage layout, fuselage structure and cabin layout.>>>
<<<The various considerations that influence the choice of wing position are given below: • Aerodynamic • Structural • Wing - fuselage attachment • Effect on cabin • Ground clearance of wing mounted engines • Servicing of wing mounted engines • Undercarriage configurations and installation • Safety in the event of the aircraft striking the ground or ditching • Effect on passengers.>>>
<<<The majority of turbofan powered civil transports have low wings.>>>
<<<The advantages of this wing position are: • Structurally it is simple, the main wing structural items can pass beneath the cabin floor thus making the wing-fuselage attachment comparatively easy.>>>
<<<• Undercarriage can be short and simple.>>>
<<<The wing mounted engines and wing flaps are more easily reached from the ground for servicing.>>>
<<<• The wing, one of the strongest parts of the aircraft, shields the fuselage in the event of the aircraft striking the ground or water.>>>
<<<In the event of ditching at sea, the wing also will act as a float thus keeping the fuselage out of the water.>>>
<<<The disadvantages of the low-wing layout are listed below.>>>
<<<• Aerodynamically, the wing upper surface is distorted thus affecting the ability of the wing to generate lift.>>>
<<<Also, a suitable wing-fuselage fairing is required to minimise the interference drag.>>>
<<<• It is more difficult to install the engines such that there is sufficient ground clearance to avoid debris being ingested from the runway.>>>
<<<• In certain seats in the cabin the downward view is obscured by the wing.>>>
<<<The high-wing position relative to the low-wing is much better aerodynamically as the upper surface is undisturbed, although the wing-fuselage fairing is probably more difficult to manufacture.>>>
<<<Structurally it is just as simple because the structure can pass above the cabin ceiling.>>>
<<<The problems arise with the height of the engines and flaps above the ground for servicing, and the design and installation of the undercarriage.>>>
<<<Most high-wing turbofan-powered aircraft have the undercarriage mounted on the fuselage.>>>
<<<One advantage of the high-wing is that the aircraft centre of gravity is lower than the wing plane hence augmenting the natural stability of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The mid-wing position is aerodynamically easier to fair into the fuselage but otherwise is no better than the low-wing.>>>
<<<Structurally it is much worse than either of the other two; the wing structure has to be terminated at the fuselage size and a joint made to a reinforced fuselage frame.>>>
<<<With regard to the other considerations such as undercarriage layout and engine installation and servicing it lies between the high- and the low-wing.>>>
<<<For a particular design each of the wing positions must be considered on its merits.>>>
<<<Except in the case of a military transport where the fuselage floor needs to be reasonably close to the ground to allow vehicles to be loaded using a ramp, the current view of the aircraft manufacturers for civil passenger aircraft favours the low-wing position.>>>
<<<Once the wing placement relative to the fuselage has been decided the next consideration is the geometry of the wing envelope.>>>
<<<Values for the following geometrical characteristics must be selected.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Aspect ratio (span) 3.>>>
<<<Wing section profile 5.>>>
<<<Thickness ratio 7.>>>
<<<Dihedral angle 2.>>>
<<<Taper ratio 4.>>>
<<<Wing/body setting 6.>>>
<<<Sweepback angle Each of these characteristics will now be described.>>>
<<<Aspect ratio When the wing area is known, the selection of aspect ratio automatically sets the span loading: aspect ratio = span/mean chord = span2/gross area As such it is influential in the generation of drag due to lift.>>>
<<<This affects the overall climbing ability of the aircraft and its cruise efficiency.>>>
<<<For example, climb per- formance with an engine failure will have to be guaranteed to meet airworthiness requirements.>>>
<<<A wing planform with a low aspect ratio will have significantly more difficulty in meeting this requirement than one with a larger span.>>>
<<<Obviously, a delicate balance has to be made between high aspect ratio designs leading to high- wing weight and long span, and low aspect ratio designs with lower wing weight but increased drag.>>>
<<<Considering the cruise condition, as aspect ratio is increased for a given wing area the overall drag of the aircraft will be reduced and the cruise fuel efficiency increased.>>>
<<<This will lead to a reduction in the requirement fuel load to fly the range but this mass reduction will be offset by the increase in wing weight resulting from the larger span.>>>
<<<Ultimately the choice of optimum aspect ratio will be determined by a trade-off study between aircraft wing mass and fuel mass leading to a total variation on aircraft all-up weight and the effect on operating costs.>>>
<<<Long-range aircraft will benefit more from the fuel savings and therefore they may be expected to have a larger value for the aspect ratio.>>>
<<<However, the combination of cruise efficiency and engine-out climb performance requirements (which are influenced by the number of engines in the aircraft layout) 'may also affect the preferred choice of aspect ratio.>>>
<<<An educated guess based on current practice and the effect of any new technologies to be incorporated into the design can be made at the preliminary design stage.>>>
<<<Typical aspect ratio values lie in the range 7-11 for commercial airliners.>>>
<<<When the aspect ratio is very low (less than 3) the wing shape will transform from the conventional trapezoidal wing into a delta planform and the airflow characteristics will change.>>>
<<<Tip vortex flow will dominate and the wing aerodynamics will alter due to the high angle of attack and vortex flow conditions generated to achieve the required lift.>>>
<<<Taper ratio The selection of taper ratio (i.e.>>>
<<<tip chord divided by aircraft centreline root chord) involves several aerodynamic considerations.>>>
<<<A constant chord rectangular planform may be easier and cheaper to manufacture than a tapered wing but it is aerodynamically and structurally less efficient.>>>
<<<Aerodynamically an elliptical planform is regarded as ideal because it reduces the tip vortex effect.>>>
<<<The geometry of some straight tapered layouts can be shown to approximate to the elliptical shape and obviously reduce the constructional complexity of a curved planform.>>>
<<<Taper ratio in the range 0.4-0.5 can be shown to be only 2-3% less aero- dynamically efficient than the elliptical shape of equal area.>>>
<<<The spanwise position of the centre of lift moves inboard as taper is increased.>>>
<<<This reduces the root bending moment which consequently reduces the wing structural weight.>>>
<<<The combined effects of increased aerodynamic efficiency and low weight tend to lead to a lower value for taper ratio (0.2-0.4) with a structural lower limit arising due to the need to provide sufficient wing tip stiffness to react forces from the aileron hinges.>>>
<<<The main drawback from low values of taper ratio comes from the fact that the tip sections are operating at a lower Reynolds number than the root sections.>>>
<<<This will mean at high angles of attack the tip sections will stall before the root.>>>
<<<A stalled tip will cause the aircraft to roll at the same time as losing lift (resulting in a nose-down pitch).>>>
<<<These are classic symptoms for entry into a spin.>>>
<<<The stalled tip flow reduces the aileron effectiveness making it more difficult for the pilot to lift the dropping wing to restrict roll.>>>
<<<There are a number of 'fixes' to counter the above stall/spin problems: • progressively twist the wing section profile so that the tip sections are flying at a lower incidence than the root (called washout); • progressively change the section profiles such that the tip section has a different thickness and camber to the inboard sections to delay the wing incidence at which the tips stall; • introduce stall trip devices to the wing root sections (e.g.>>>
<<<increased nose profile or stall strips).>>>
<<<All the above methods have the disadvantage of reducing aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft in cruise and climb (i.e.>>>
<<<at angles of attack lower than stall).>>>
<<<Operational methods have been used on some aircraft to avoid the aerodynamic penalties.>>>
<<<These include 'stick pushers' which are operated automatically at an angle of attack slightly lower than stall, and stall warning devices that are triggered by the detection of the stalled flow over the wing.>>>
<<<These devices may be specified as 'advisory' in which case the pilot has the authority to disregard the warning, or may be classed as 'primary' in which case the stick pusher is actuated.>>>
<<<As in the case of aspect ratio, the adverse aerodynamic effects associated with increasing taper are counteracted by a reduction in wing mass due to the movement of the centre of pressure to the inboard sections and therefore a trade-off study is necessary to confirm or otherwise the choice of taper ratio.>>>
<<<At this stage in the design process an initial choice can only be based on existing aircraft and the effect of any new technologies.>>>
<<<It is in the selection of aspect and taper ratios that parametric trade-off studies become important (see Chapter 13).>>>
<<<In many wing planforms a double (or multiple) taper is used as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<6.1.>>>
<<<Such planforms may be chosen for essentially non-aerodynamic reasons (to reduce manufacturing complexity, to increase root thickness to provide storage depth to reduce wing/fuselage interference).>>>

<<<Swept wing Wing section profile The selection of wing section profile is one of the most important decisions of the aircraft design process.>>>
<<<It is extremely difficult to correct a poor choice as the whole of the wing geometry will be based on the chosen wing section co-ordinates.>>>
<<<The aerodynamic characteristics of the section will be designed to provide an acceptable compromise between the operational requirements of the aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<high lift/drag ratio in cruise, good climb performance particularly in emergency flight conditions, good low speed lift, smooth high speed flight, delay of critical Mach number, good propulsion integration, etc.).>>>
<<<The most critical operational aspects will take priority.>>>
<<<Traditionally, wing section data has been presented in a series of curves which show the principal aerodynamic characteristics (lift coefficient, CL, drag coefficient, CD, and aerodynamic moment coefficient, CM) as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<6.2.>>>
<<<From a design point of view the following wing section parameters are of interest: • maximum lift coefficient • lift/curve slope • incidence for zero lift with flap deflected clean wing (no flap) with flap deflected clean wing (no flap) Wing angle of attack Fig.>>>
<<<6.2 Wing section characteristics (two-dimensional).>>>
<<<• drag/incidence ratio • minimum drag incidence • lift coefficient at minimum drag (maximum L/D) • aerodynamic moment coefficient/incidence Correction of the above sectional data for three-dimensional flow (e.g.>>>
<<<accounting for aspect ratio, Mach number, Reynolds number and tip shape) is necessary.>>>
<<<The methods used for such corrections are somewhat empirical and may lead to inaccurate estimates.>>>
<<<It is therefore essential to conduct more detailed analysis and wind tunnel tests at an early stage in the design.>>>
<<<Modern computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods now allow the full three- dimensional flow regime to be studied.>>>
<<<It is possible to suitably modify wing section shape along the wing span to suit the critical conditions (e.g.>>>
<<<engine pylon intersection).>>>
<<<These methods are now used to specify the full wing surface geometry and to generate the aerodynamic parameters at various operating speeds.>>>
<<<One of the benefits from this type of analysis has been the design of the wing profiles which delay the onset of critical Mach number.>>>
<<<Such 'sections' are sometimes referred to as 'supercritical'.>>>
<<<Compared with older aerofoil types, the advanced wing sections give the following options: • at the same cruise Mach number enable the wing to have a higher thickness ratio or less sweep without detriment to the cruise drag; or • at the same thickness ratio delay the drag rise to a higher Mach number.>>>
<<<Wing/body setting One of the wing parameters which is dependent on sectional geometry is the wing incidence at cruise.>>>
<<<It is important to ensure that the fuselage is at its minimum drag attitude at the mid-cruise condition.>>>
<<<This condition dictates the wing/body setting angle.>>>
<<<One of the characteristics of modern section geometry is the reflex curvature on the under surface towards the trailing edge.>>>
<<<This shaping may not suit the flap profiles in this region and may require the section to be modified (i.e.>>>
<<<flattening of the section at the trailing edge).>>>
<<<The influence of flap geometry on wing layout is dealt with later.>>>
<<<Thickness ratio The thickness (or thickness /chord ratio) of the wing section will often be decided by the total CFD wing design.>>>
<<<Thickness is normally variable along the span to suit the local flow conditions.>>>
<<<For structural (minimum weight) and volumetric criteria the thickness should be as deep as possible.>>>
<<<Wing bending moment and shear force gradually increase from the tip to the root; therefore wing thickness is frequently chosen to be smaller at the tip and progressively increased along the span to the fuselage shear connections at the root.>>>
<<<For subsonic aircraft an average thickness of 10% is typical.>>>
<<<For supersonic aircraft wave drag is important.>>>
<<<This can be shown to be proportional to the square of thickness ratio, therefore much thinner sections are specified (5-8% for such wings).>>>
<<<Aircraft centreline Start of stall Start of stall Fig.>>>
<<<6.3 Spanwise flow over swept wing planforms.>>>
<<<Sweepback angle Sweepback is mainly used to reduce drag from local flow velocities at or close to supersonic speed.>>>
<<<Sweeping the wing planform back allows thicker wing sections to be used and delays the onset of the critical Mach number.>>>
<<<An equivalent effect can be shown for forward swept wings but these are intrinsically structurally unstable and therefore need a heavier structure to avoid undesirable aeroelastic effects.>>>
<<<The main aerodynamic penalty from sweepback is the generation of spanwise flow over the wing planform as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<6.3.>>>
<<<The spanwise drift of the flow reduces lift, increases boundary layer thickness, increases drag, reduces aileron effectiveness and increases risk of tip stall.>>>
<<<There are several 'fixes' which can be applied to reduce these effects.>>>
<<<These include aerodynamic or physical fences to impose a straightening of the flow (engine nacelle supports (pylons) are sometimes used in this way).>>>
<<<Creating a small vortex by kinking the wing planform can also be beneficial (e.g.>>>
<<<multi-tapered planform shapes) as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<6.4.>>>
<<<Flap effectiveness is reduced by the swept trailing edge which reduces the maximum lift coefficient from the deflected flap.>>>
<<<It is therefore common to make the trailing edge sweep much less than the leading edge.>>>
<<<Sweep has been used on some aircraft layouts to balance the wing centre of pressure with the aircraft centre of gravity, or to place the wing carry through structure at a more convenient section in the fuselage as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<chord positions and therefore run spanwise, will introduce a kink load at the fuselage side.>>>
<<<This will necessitate a heavy bodyside rib to redistribute the loading.>>>
<<<Also as outboard sections of the wing have a centre of pressure aft of the spar reaction points a swept wing is automatically loaded with an extra torque load (acting nose downwards for swept back wings and dangerously upwards for swept forward wings).>>>
<<<This extra torque will require increased skin thickness to provide torsional stability to the wing section.>>>
<<<The combination of the extra kink loads and the torque makes swept wings heavier than straight ones.>>>
<<<This presents another 'optimisation' opportunity (sweepback reduces aircraft drag and therefore fuel required but increases aircraft structure weight).>>>
<<<Sweep angle is only matched to one flight condition and this may not be acceptable for aircraft with complex operational patterns.>>>
<<<Due to the reduced lift potential for swept wings it would be an advantage if the sweep angle could be reduced in the  take- off  and  landing  phases  (to  increase  flap  effectiveness).>>>
<<<To satisfy  such  design  criteria  it  is  possible  to  pivot  the wing  at  the  body  sides  and adjust  the sweep angle to suit the flight regime (variable- sweep,  swing- wing).>>>
<<<Apart from  the weight  and complexity  of this feature, the trailing edge (flap)  and leading edge  geometry  is  compromised  by  the  overlapping  of  the  fuselage  bodyside structure.>>>
<<<This feature  has so far  been used only on military  aircraft  because of the complex operational requirements.>>>
<<<U p to now no civil  aircraft  has gone into airline service  with  a  variable  sweep  wing  but  the  early  US  supersonic  civil  aircraft proposals  did  use  this  layout  to  match  the  supersonic  and  subsonic  cruise requirements.>>>

<<<The wing geometry is given dihedral to increase lateral stability in yaw.>>>
<<<It would be easier to build a wing without dihedral but this can lead to aircraft which are difficult to fly in cross-wind conditions.>>>
<<<The placement of the wing on the fuselage also affects lateral stability (high-wings are more stable than low-wings).>>>
<<<For a conventional unswept trapezoidal wing the dihedral angle would typically be 0-1° for high-wings, 2-4° for mid wings and 3-6° for low wings.>>>
<<<For low wings the dihedral angle may be higher to provide sufficient ground clearance for wing mounted engines.>>>
<<<Wing sweepback naturally increases the aircraft yaw stability.>>>
<<<For swept wing aircraft dihedral angle is therefore less.>>>
<<<To reduce the required size of control surface on some aircraft the de-stabling influence of negative dihedral (anhedral) may be used to increase roll sensitivity (e.g.>>>
<<<high-wing large transport aircraft show this effect).>>>

<<<Flap type and geometry There are a variety of trailing edge and leading edges devices available to augment the lifting capability of the wing.>>>
<<<These are discussed briefly in Chapter 8 and an indication given of their effect on the aerodynamics of the wing.>>>
<<<Conventional mechanical flaps have only been considered as to date these are the only types to have been used on civil jet transport aircraft.>>>

<<<Sweepback at quarter chord influence the achievable maximum lift.>>>
<<<However, at high values, the effectiveness of increasing chord is reduced giving practical upper limits for chord lengths as: 25% 30% 30-40% for split flaps for plain flaps for slotted or Fowler flaps Similarly the angle of deflection of the flap loses effectiveness at larger angles.>>>
<<<Typical maximum deflection angle for various types of flap are: 55-60° split 40-50° plain fowler 30-40° leading edge 15-20° The lift curve slope for a section with flap remains approximately unchanged from the unflapped section but the angle of incidence at stall is reduced.>>>
<<<This has the beneficial effect of triggering stall at the inboard flapped sections and away from the outboard section thus helping to prevent tip stall.>>>
<<<Structural design The aerodynamic advantages of the flap do not come cheap.>>>
<<<The flap structure and operating system complicate the wing trailing edge structure and introduce mechanical and electrical systems into the relatively thin sections at the trailing edge.>>>
<<<Introducing flaps onto the wing will increase aircraft structure and system masses and add extra cost to the aircraft manufacture.>>>
<<<However, in general the improvements to the aircraft performance from the introduction of flaps are worth these penalties.>>>
<<<Wing planform studies Careful selection of each of the above geometric parameters will need to be made during the project design phase.>>>
<<<The wing layout must satisfy a number of competing demands from aerodynamic, stability, control, internal space, structures, manufacture, maintenance and overall costs.>>>
<<<Once the aircraft has passed into the detail design phase only minor changes to the wing parameters are usually possible.>>>
<<<The more time and care taken in establishing the most efficient wing geometry at the project design stage the better.>>>
<<<Chapter 13 provides details of how such studies can be undertaken.>>>
<<<The main criterion for the design of the tail surfaces is the provision of adequate stability and control for the aircraft.>>>
<<<There may be other requirements that have to be met by the tail (e.g.>>>
<<<fuel tankage, structural support, etc.)>>>
<<<but these are regarded as secondary to the main stability and control criteria.>>>
<<<Technically this resolves into the provision of adequate moments about the aircraft centre of gravity to counteract de-stabilising forces from the aircraft geometry.>>>
<<<The degree of stability and control to be provided will depend on the aircraft operational requirements.>>>
<<<A large transport aircraft will need to be stable under various loading con- figurations and have enough control response to be able to gently position the aircraft, fly in emergency (engine-out) conditions and react to side winds.>>>
<<<A light executive aircraft will need quick response from the controls which may dictate artificial stability from other aircraft systems in conjunction with the pilot input.>>>
<<<The aircraft stability and control requirements are usually considered in three flight regimes.>>>
<<<Roll response (motion about the x axis) is conventionally provided by ailerons but for some aircraft layouts this is not feasible so differential motion of the horizontal tailplane is used.>>>
<<<The pitch response, often termed longitudinal stability (motion about the y axis), dictates the size of horizontal stabiliser(s) (conventional tail, or canard, or both!).>>>
<<<The yaw and sideslip response, termed lateral stability (motion about the z axis), dictates the vertical stabiliser(s).>>>
<<<Each of the three types of motion are not independent since motion about one axis causes an effect on the others but for simplification in the initial project stage and for conventional layouts it is acceptable to consider them both de-coupled.>>>
<<<The aircraft layout, will have a considerable effect on stability and control aspects and careful thought must be given if unusual arrangements are proposed.>>>
<<<The following list identifies some of the layout considerations for each flight action.>>>
<<<Pitch The following points have to be taken into account when sizing the tailplane.>>>
<<<• The tailplane has to cope with the required centre of gravity (e.g.)>>>
<<<travel in the en-route flight regime.>>>
<<<A typical e.g.>>>
<<<range would be from a forward e.g.>>>
<<<of 10% of the mean aerodynamic chord to a rear e.g.>>>
<<<of 35% of the mean aerodynamic chord.>>>
<<<It must have enough power to provide the necessary trim and control.>>>
<<<• The forward e.g.>>>
<<<position with a typical tricycle undercarriage and with take-off flap will give the highest load on the nose wheel.>>>
<<<The tailplane needs to be sized to provide enough force to lift the nose at the required rotation speed.>>>
<<<• The tailplane must be large enough to be able to trim the aircraft on the approach with full landing flap at the worst e.g.>>>
<<<position and at the same time provide enough power to control and flare the aircraft at touchdown.>>>
<<<During the flare manoeuvre ground effect can have a significant influence.>>>
<<<• The wing section profile, wing planform and position relative to the aircraft centre of gravity will affect aircraft stability due to the pitching moments created by the lift, drag and aerodynamic pressure distribution.>>>
<<<More wing camber, thicker section and flapped wings have intrinsically larger aerodynamic moment which will demand a larger tail to balance the aircraft.>>>
<<<• Engine installation has an influence due to the vertical offset of the thrust line from the aircraft centre of gravity and the pitching inertia contribution from the engine mass position.>>>
<<<Region of disturbed airflow Fig.>>>
<<<6.11 Avoidance of aircraft 'deep stall' condition.>>>
<<<• The position of the horizontal tail relative to the wing and fuselage (and rear engines) influences the effectiveness of the tail to produce the balancing force.>>>
<<<A high (tee) tail positioned away from these interferences is the most effective.>>>
<<<The tail should be positioned relative to the jet efflux so that effects from throttle changes are avoided or kept to a minimum.>>>
<<<The position of the horizontal tail relative to the wing in side view will also determine the aircraft's ability to enter a deep stall.>>>
<<<A deep stall occurs at high angles of attack when the wake of the stalled wing blankets the horizontal tail making it ineffective and thus virtually impossible to recover from the stall.>>>
<<<Figure 6.11 shows the effect on the aircraft of the deep stall.>>>
<<<Notice that the tailplane lies in a region where the airflow has little net velocity in the longitudinal direction.>>>
<<<This degrades the effectiveness of the tailplane to produce a lift force to take the aircraft out of the stall attitude.>>>
<<<This produces a stable flight condition with little forward speed but with a steady vertical descent.>>>
<<<Without the ability to recover from this condition the aircraft will eventually crash.>>>
<<<This unsafe situation can be avoided by positioning the tailplane outside (usually below) the area of the stalled wing wake.>>>
<<<Wind tunnel tests would be used to verify the safe effectiveness of tail position in the wing stall attitude.>>>
<<<Modern airliners are equipped with systems that warn the pilot if the aircraft is approaching a stalled attitude.>>>
<<<The pilot, unless conducting a highly controlled flight test, will normally respond to such warnings by pushing the aircraft nose down to reduce wing angle of attack and thereby increase aircraft speed.>>>
<<<Yaw The primary control for yaw is the fin with its rudder.>>>
<<<The following points need to be taken into account when sizing the fin.>>>
<<<• The fin size must be such as to cope with the required e.g.>>>
<<<travel in the en-route flight regimes.>>>
<<<• In the event of an engine failure particularly for engines mounted on the wing, the fin must be capable of generating a sufficient side force to balance the resulting de-stabilising moment.>>>
<<<• The cross-wind requirement in the landing configuration can often size the fin.>>>
<<<The engine failure case above, in the take-off condition is usually the critical sizing criterion for the fin, for aircraft with wing-mounted engines.>>>
<<<Roll The primary controls here are usually wing mounted ailerons or spoilers or a combination of both.>>>
<<<An alternative would be to use differential controls on the horizontal stabilisers.>>>
<<<These have mainly been used on fighter aircraft where the inertia in roll is so much lower than on the larger civil transports.>>>
<<<The roll controls have to be sized to produce rates of roll and acceleration in roll to meet the appropriate requirements.>>>
<<<At the initial project stage on a civil transport using wing mounted controls, a study of current aircraft will enable an initial assessment of the size of these controls to be made.>>>
<<<As noted earlier the motion of the aircraft around each of the three axes has been considered to be independent.>>>
<<<However, there is a considerable dependence between them, particularly between yaw and roll.>>>
<<<Hence a full stability and control analysis will be necessary at a later stage in the design process.>>>
<<<At the initial project stage insufficient is known about the aircraft to carry out such an analysis.>>>
<<<An estimate based on volume coefficients (V) is sufficiently accurate at this stage.>>>
<<<Kan = (SHT x LHT)I(S x c) Ffin = (SVT x LVT)/S x b where: 5, b and c are the gross wing area, span and mean aerodynamic chord of the wing; SHT, SVT are the areas of the tailplane and elevator, and the fin and rudder; LHT9 LVT are the tail arms measured from the aircraft centre of gravity to the quarter mean aerodynamic chord positions on the horizontal and vertical surfaces.>>>
<<<The tail arm geometry is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<6.12.>>>
<<<Typical values for the volume coefficient vary widely between different aircraft types (Vtail from 0.5 to 1.2, Vfin from 0.04 to 0.12).>>>
<<<For initial project design purposes it is necessary to evaluate the volume coefficients for aircraft with similar layout, operation and weight to the proposed design and then use this value for estimation of tail areas.>>>
<<<Care must be taken to allow for the introduction of new technologies (e.g.>>>
<<<relaxed stability) as this may influence tail sizing.>>>
<<<There are many different possibilities for the layout of the tail surfaces, these include: • conventional low tailplane with central fin • mid-position tailplane Wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord position Horizontal tail quarter mean aerodynamic chord position Area SHT Area SVT Vertical tail quarter mean aerodynamic chord position Fig.>>>
<<<6.12 Tail arm geometry.>>>
<<<• tee-tail • twin booms • twin fins • butterfly tail • canard • dorsal and vertical fins All the unconventional configurations have advantages in some applications but care must be exercised when specifying such unusual configurations.>>>
<<<Airworthiness requirements and flight testing will dictate handling qualities which must be met by the tail design (e.g.>>>
<<<mass balancing of the controls, control force harmonising).>>>
<<<The correct sizing of the tail surface seems to be more of an art than a science due to the often conflicting requirements of the various control demands and the inter-connections of the various flight modes.>>>
<<<It is interesting to look at existing aircraft and notice the 'fixes' that have been found to be necessary to correct faults that were not predicted by the original design team.>>>
<<<Aircraft mass and balance Objectives Aircraft mass estimation and the associated 'balancing' of the layout are two of the main decision areas in the project phase of the design.>>>
<<<The initial crude 'guesstimates' at the aircraft take-off weight will be progressively refined as more details of the aircraft configuration and systems are settled.>>>
<<<This chapter is intended to show how the mass estimation process is progressed and how details of the configuration and systems are related to the total aircraft mass.>>>
<<<After an initial explanation of the factors which affect mass, a simplified method to determine the first estimate of aircraft take-off mass is presented together with an example calculation.>>>
<<<A more detailed mass estimation method is then described together with formulae and expressions to predict each of the main components of the aircraft.>>>
<<<After this it is possible to list the items in a standardised mass statement for the aircraft.>>>
<<<The form of this list is described and the various sub-groupings shown.>>>
<<<With a detailed list of component masses it is possible to determine the aircraft centre of gravity (e.g.).>>>
<<<Methods by which the component masses are positioned are given.>>>
<<<Some of the aircraft masses are dependent on the type of operation (e.g.>>>
<<<fuel and payload); this must be analysed to determine the furthest forward and aft limits to the position of the aircraft centre of gravity.>>>
<<<The methods by which the aircraft e.g.>>>
<<<range is predicted are shown and the influence of aircraft configuration described.>>>
<<<The way that the aircraft mass is affected by the stage-distance and passenger-load leads to the generation of the standard 'payload-range' diagram.>>>
<<<The influence of aircraft weight and other geometry restrictions on the diagram is described.>>>
<<<Finally a method is presented which balances the wing and fuselage group masses and sets the relative position of the wing to the fuselage geometry.>>>
<<<After studying this chapter it will be possible to estimate the overall mass of the aircraft, determine the mass of component parts, balance the aircraft and determine the centre of gravity limits that result from the loading procedures.>>>
<<<All these aspects are essential to the specification of the baseline configuration.>>>
<<<The following chapters amplify the inter-relationship between weight and other specialist types of analysis.>>>
<<<A knowledge of mass estimation and aircraft balance is necessary to fully appreciate this inter-relationship and the compromises that are necessary to produce a successful overall design.>>>
<<<These aspects are covered in detail in this chapter.>>>
<<<Introduction Aircraft mass (commonly called weight) more than any other design parameter, is seen to influence the design of the aircraft in the project stages.>>>
<<<From the earliest days of flight (and for some time before) it was appreciated that the aircraft had to overcome the effects of gravity.>>>
<<<With limited power from the engine it was soon realised that the most significant improvements in aircraft performance could be achieved by a reduction of aircraft mass.>>>
<<<This understanding of the direct relationship between aircraft performance and mass made it important for the pioneers to produce aircraft as light as economically feasible.>>>
<<<These same influences are felt by present-day designers but they are now aware of many more factors which influence aircraft mass.>>>
<<<Performance aspects are still highly significant but they are now compromised by environmental restrictions (e.g.>>>
<<<noise regulations), airworthiness regulations (e.g.>>>
<<<climb rate after engine failure on take-off), and operational aspects (e.g.>>>
<<<extended twin-engined operation, ETOPS).>>>
<<<The designers also have a wider choice of technologies available and this requires careful judgement with respect to aircraft mass reductions and the technical risks involved.>>>
<<<Two of the most crucial decisions in this respect are the choice of new materials (e.g.>>>
<<<composites) and the relaxation of inherent stability (e.g.>>>
<<<automatic computer stabilisation).>>>
<<<Both technology advances offer substantial mass savings but confidence in their adoption requires the assessment and acceptance of the level of technical and financial uncertainty associated with their development.>>>
<<<During the project design stages it is possible to assess the advantages and drawbacks for the introduction of such new technologies in theoretical 'paper' designs.>>>
<<<This requires the study of the trade-offs between improved aircraft efficiency and the associated increase in commercial risk.>>>
<<<Aircraft weight is a common factor which links all the separate design activities layout, airworthiness, environmental, (aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, economic and operational aspects).>>>
<<<To this end, at each stage of the design, a check is made on the expected total mass of the completed aircraft.>>>
<<<As described in Chapter 2, a separate design organisation (weights department) is employed to assess and control weight.>>>
<<<In the early stages of the design, estimates have to be made from historical statistical data of all the component parts of the aircraft.>>>
<<<As parts are manufactured and the aircraft prototype reaches completion it is possible to check the accuracy of the estimates by weighing each component and where necessary instigate weight reduction programmes.>>>
<<<Overweight aircraft will suffer reductions in range, reduced climbing ability, reduced manoeuvrability and increased take-off and landing distances.>>>
<<<If the operating requirements do not permit these reductions in performance (e.g.>>>
<<<specified ) 5 9 9 1 ( M $ e c i r p t f a r c r i a l t a o T Fig.>>>
<<<7.1 Aircraft price relative to aircraft operational mass (source Avmark data).>>>
<<<Operational empty mass (1000kg) maximum runway length) the increase in aircraft empty weight must be offset by a reduction in useful load to ensure that the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft is not exceeded.>>>
<<<This reduction in useful load will make the aircraft less competitive and affect the commercial success of the project.>>>
<<<For aircraft with conventional layouts and structural form there is a direct relationship between operational empty weight and basic aircraft price (Fig.>>>
<<<7.1).>>>
<<<Hence increases in aircraft weight will not only be reflected in increased operational costs but will add to the purchase price of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Extra weight will affect the fuel used to fly the specified range.>>>
<<<The cost of this extra fuel and the increase in aircraft price shown above combine to adversely affect the direct operating costs for the aircraft.>>>
<<<Estimating the value of weight saving In aircraft project studies it is possible to show the effects of increased aircraft structure weight on the aircraft design.>>>
<<<If the aircraft specification (e.g.>>>
<<<range, take-off performance, etc.)>>>
<<<is to be maintained then increase in structure weight due to inefficient design will lead to greater fuel usage, larger engines, stronger landing gear, larger wing and tail areas.>>>
<<<These increases will lead in turn to a demand for a heavier structure.>>>
<<<This vicious circle effect is known as 'weight growth'.>>>
<<<Project studies show that for every kilogram of unnecessary structure mass on the aircraft, the maximum take-off mass of the aircraft will increase by about three kilograms.>>>
<<<To illustrate the influence of weight growth two aircraft were designed to fly the same range but with different numbers of passengers  Table 7.1 Influence of aircraft size on mass parameters Aircraft size: number of seats Increase in structure mass (kg) Increase in operational empty mass (kg) Increase in fuel requirement (kg) Increase in aircraft maximum TO mass (kg) Weight growth factor Increase in aircraft price ($M) 300 1000 1879 1255 3034 3.03 0.87 600 1000 1756 1431 3188 3.19 1.19 (300 and 600).>>>
<<<A structure mass penalty of 1000 kg was then added and the aircraft redesigned.>>>
<<<The changes in the main design parameters are shown in Table 7.1.>>>
<<<These figures provide a strong incentive to produce low weight designs.>>>
<<<The weight growth phenomenon can be utilised in weight saving programmes.>>>
<<<If a new manufacturing process or material can be introduced that will save aircraft structural mass, the cost of the new technology can be offset by the full weight saving on the aircraft.>>>
<<<For such reasons the manufacturers introduce advances in technology as soon as they are shown to be commercially viable.>>>
<<<In the above study, the cost of weight increase (and correspondingly the value of a weight reduction program) is assessed by the increase in aircraft price and cost of the extra fuel used.>>>
<<<Dividing the increase in aircraft price by the weight increase shows a basic value of weight saving of about $500 per pound (Ib).>>>
<<<This compares well to published data from the Society of Allied Weight Engineers.1 The cost penalty resulting from the increased fuel used can be aggregated over the operational life of the aircraft (assuming a typical utilisation).>>>
<<<This shows a similar increase in operating cost and therefore a further $500 per pound value of saving weight.>>>
<<<The study was done using 1995 price values; therefore these costs may be expected to rise with inflation over the life of the aircraft.>>>
<<<It is clear from these studies that $1000 per pound is a conservative estimate for the value of weight saving on civil aircraft in the 300-600 seat size, providing that the weight savings can be identified during the initial design stage.>>>
<<<If weight growth is identified later in the design process when the aircraft maximum take-off weight has been frozen, the payload or fuel load must be proportionately reduced.>>>
<<<Reducing the number of passengers or cargo load directly affects revenue potential.>>>
<<<Reducing fuel load restricts range and therefore the operational potential.>>>
<<<Over the total life of the aircraft such penalties can be shown to be expensive.>>>
<<<In such circumstances the value of weight saving can be shown to be much higher than the value assessed during the project design phase.>>>
<<<The initial mass estimate The importance of aircraft weight with regard to performance, design, economics and regulatory aspects is shown in Fig.>>>

<<<7.2 Influences on aircraft weight.>>>
<<<aircraft take-off mass.>>>
<<<This is then used to make initial performance estimations.>>>
<<<A crude estimate can be made by considering the three components below: MT0 = MUL + ME + MF where: MTO = take-off mass MUL = useful load ME = aircraft empty mass MF = fuel mass The three unknowns on the right hand side of the take-off mass equation are considered separately below.>>>
<<<Useful load Useful load (M1nJ can be determined from the original aircraft specification (passengers + cargo).>>>
<<<Some operational items and the number of crew are linked to the number of passengers or payload capacity and to operators' practices and will affect the operational empty weight of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Aircraft empty mass Aircraft empty mass (ME) will vary for different types of aircraft and for different operational profiles.>>>
<<<All that can be done in the initial stage of the design is to roughly size the aircraft by considering the expected ratio of empty mass to maximum take-off mass (ME/MTO).>>>
<<<It is necessary to use data from existing and OEM MTOM Fig.>>>
<<<7.3 Aircraft empty mass to take-off mass fraction.>>>
<<<Maximum mass (1000kg) previous designs to provide a guide to this ratio.>>>
<<<Figure 7.3 shows the weight fraction for a wide range of current aircraft sizes.>>>
<<<Some of the aircraft may have higher values than expected because they include structural provision for later stretched versions of the type.>>>
<<<It is wise to select aircraft at sizes (number of passengers and range) close to the proposed aircraft.>>>
<<<Select aircraft from the aircraft data file (Data A) as a starting point.>>>
<<<Plot the data and select an appropriate value for the empty mass ratio.>>>
<<<Values in the range 52-62% are representative with the lower values associated with long-haul aircraft.>>>
<<<Fuel mass Fuel mass (MF) will be dependent on the mission profile for the aircraft.>>>
<<<In the initial design phase it is difficult to accurately predict the fuel used in each of the non-cruise flight segments (take-off, climb, cruise, descent and landing) so an estimate has to be made based on an extended cruise phase.>>>
<<<Cruise fuel can be determined from a modified range equation: MF = fuel flow x flight time = -SFC x thrust x time where SFC is the engine specific fuel consumption at a representative cruise condition.>>>
<<<The above equation can be rewritten in terms of 'fuel fraction' (MF/MTO): MF/MTO = SFC x (thrust/MTO) x time As the aircraft is in equilibrium in the cruise condition (i.e.>>>
<<<not manoeuvring or accelerating): (thrust = drag) and (lift = aircraft weight = MTO • g) where g is the gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s2.>>>
<<<Substituting the lift (L) and drag (D) conditions in the fuel fraction equation gives: MF/MTO = SFC x (D/L) .>>>
<<<f x time v ' = SFC xgx (D/L) x time A fuller explanation of SFC is given in Chapter 9.>>>
<<<Typical values can be found in the engine data file (Data B).>>>
<<<Typical low bypass ratio engines have SFC values 1.0-0.7 lb/hr/Ib, and high bypass ratio engines have values down to 0.5.>>>
<<<Values will also depend on cruise speeds.>>>
<<<From existing data select a value for an engine type similar to the one to be used in the project.>>>
<<<The lift/drag (L/D) ratio varies with the aircraft aerodynamic design and the cruise lift coefficient.>>>
<<<Transport aircraft are designed to be most efficient in the cruise phase so will have a reasonably high L/D ratio.>>>
<<<Typical values are between 14 and 19 with the higher numbers related to larger long-range aircraft with large span.>>>
<<<It is possible to determine the approximate L/D ratio for existing aircraft from the aircraft data file (Data A) using the modified range equation shown in Chapter 11 (p. 282).>>>
<<<Flight time is estimated by dividing the stage distance by the cruise speed.>>>
<<<The specified design range is increased to allow for non-cruise flight segments (take-off, climb, descent and landing), the fuel reserves (diversion and hold), and other contingencies (e.g.>>>
<<<wind).>>>
<<<The total range to be allowed for in the fuel weight estimation is called the equivalent still air range (ESAR).>>>
<<<The determination of ESAR from the specified aircraft range is complicated because different operators assume their own conditions.>>>
<<<The expression below can be used for medium- to long-haul flights (>2000nm).>>>
<<<For shorter stages the coefficient will be less and the reserves smaller.>>>
<<<ESAR = 568 + 1.063 x Specified range The main equation for aircraft take-off mass (MTO = MUL + ME + MF) can be written as: MTO = MUL/{1 - (MJMTO) - (MF/MTO)} This form of the equation is useful as it only requires a knowledge of the mass ratios for aircraft empty weight and fuel load.>>>
<<<These ratios can be assumed to be similar to aircraft of the same type and size if the absolute mass is difficult to determine.>>>
<<<Example To illustrate the use of the initial estimation method described above, consider the design of a medium size (180 seats), medium range (2000 nm) aircraft.>>>
<<<The useful load is estimated as: passenger mass (180 x 75 kg) 13 500 baggage (20 kg each) 3600 total (MUL) = 17100 kg From a review of similar aircraft the operational empty weight fraction is assumed to be 51%.>>>
<<<The 'fuel fraction' is estimated from the formula below: (MF/MTO) = SFC - (D/L).>>>
<<<(ESAR/V) From the engine data file the SFC for a medium bypass engine is 0.71b/hr/lb.>>>
<<<This is in weight (force) units; therefore the '#' has been accounted for in the value.>>>
<<<Assumed cruise speed is 500kt (257.7m/s).>>>
<<<Cruise L/D ratio is assumed to be 18 (current technology value).>>>
<<<From the expression shown earlier and some allowance for the type of operation the equivalent still air range appropriate to the design range of 2000 nm is assumed to be 2750 nm, therefore: (MF/MTO) = 0.7 • (1/18) • (2750/500) = 21.4% We can now use the MTO equation to estimate the aircraft take-off mass: MTO = 17 100/(1 - 0.51 - 0.214) = 61 957kg (approx.>>>
<<<62000) The estimation of MTO is very sensitive to the prediction of empty and fuel mass ratios.>>>
<<<If both of these are changed by only 1% (i.e.>>>
<<<2% in the total) the resulting estimation of MTO would vary between 60000 and 64000 (i.e.>>>
<<<± about 2000 kg).>>>
<<<Because of this sensitivity the initial estimation must be checked against more detailed methods as soon as the aircraft layout is defined in more detail.>>>
<<<Detailed mass estimation As more details of the aircraft become known it is possible to use more accurate methods to predict component masses.>>>
<<<Ultimately, when the detail drawings of all the components are available, more accurate estimates can be made by calculating the volume of each part and multiplying by the density of the material.>>>
<<<In the project design stages we are unlikely to know the size of individual aircraft components to this level of detail but it is possible to use prediction methods that progressively become more accurate as the aircraft geometry is developed.>>>
<<<Most aircraft design textbooks3 contain such methods.>>>
<<<A set of equations using some of the aircraft geometrical data is presented below.>>>
<<<At the preliminary stages of mass prediction, the masses for each main com- ponent of the aircraft are summed to give the maximum total mass [often incorrectly termed the 'take-off mass' (MTOM)].>>>
<<<Operationally the aircraft will have various take-off masses depending on the stage length and payload.>>>
<<<A more detailed estimation of aircraft take-off mass can be determined by summing the main component masses as shown below: MTOM = Mw + M1 + MB + M N + M u c + Msc + MPROP + MFE + MOp + MCR + MPAY + MF where: Mw = mass of wing including control surfaces and flaps MT =mass of tail surfaces (tailplane/elevator + fin /rudder) MB =mass of fuselage (body), including wing attachment structure M N = mass of engine nacelles (not including engine or propulsion system) M u c = mass of undercarriage (nose + main units) Msc = mass of surface controls MpRQp = mass of propulsion system (engines + all systems) MFE =mass of fixed equipment (electric, hydraulic, etc.)>>>
<<<MOP =mass of operational items (residual fuels and oil, safety equipment, etc.)>>>
<<<MCR = mass of crew MPAY = mass of payload (passengers, baggage, freight, etc.)>>>
<<<MF = mass of fuel (including reserves) Component mass estimation If possible, several different methods should be used to estimate each of the component masses in the equation above.>>>
<<<This will give confidence to the prediction and guard against inappropriate use of formulae.>>>
<<<When it is impossible to determine the absolute mass of a component (perhaps because insufficient details are available) it is acceptable to use a standardised mass ratio, i.e.>>>
<<<mass of component/MTOM Such ratios can be determined from existing aircraft of a similar type to the one under investigation.>>>
<<<This procedure is often used in the early stages of project design.>>>
<<<The component mass estimating methods presented below are derived from statistical data of existing aircraft.>>>
<<<In general, the aircraft on which the data is based will be of conventional layout with a semi-monocoque aluminium alloy structural framework.>>>
<<<For designs not of this layout or manufactured from other materials the estimates will need to be suitably adjusted.>>>
<<<Detail mass formulae will vary for different types of aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<business jets, large transport aircraft, etc.).>>>
<<<The formulae quoted in the sections below are taken from detailed mass statements of existing civil transport aircraft.>>>
<<<Each of the component mass groups in the mass list above will now be considered separately.>>>
<<<Wing group (Mw) The wing group is assumed to comprise all the structural items on the wing including surface controls (ailerons, flaps, lift dumpers, etc.)>>>
<<<but not the systems within the wing (e.g.>>>
<<<flight control systems, fuel tankage and system, anti-icing, etc.).>>>
<<<Previous designs show that the ratio M^l MTOM will be in the range 9-14% with the range 10-12% covering most medium- to long-range aircraft.>>>
<<<As the design unfolds and more detailed geometric data are known it is possible to use formulae which include specific wing parameters.>>>
<<<The expression shown below has been developed for conventional aircraft wing geometry made from aluminium alloy.>>>
<<<The estimate may be reduced by up to 20% to account for the introduction of lighter composite materials for control surfaces and for lightly stressed parts of the structure.>>>
<<<Mw = 0.021 265 (MTOM x NULT)0AS43 x SREF01*19 x ARW0-993 x (1 -f TRW)04 x (1 - R/MTOM)04/(WSWEEP x TCW0A) where: MTOM = aircraft maximum take-off mass (kg) NULT = aircraft ultimate load factor (typically 3.75) SREF = gross wing area (m2) ARW = wing aspect ratio TRW = wing taper ratio TCW = wing average thickness/chord ratio WSWEEP = wing quarter-chord sweepback angle (deg) R is the effect of inertia relief on the wing root bending moment given by R = {Mw + MF + [(2 x Meng x BIE)/0AB] + [(2 x Meng x BOE)/0AB]} where: Mw = wing mass estimated or iterated with this method (kg) MF = mission fuel ( = MTOM - MPAY - MOE) (kg) MPAY = mass of payload (kg) MOE = operational empty mass of aircraft (kg) Meng = individual engine plus nacelle mass (kg) Bm = distance between inboard engines (m) BOE = distance between outboard engines (if appropriate) (m) B = aircraft wing span (m) A more detailed wing mass estimation method is described in the AIAA Journal of Aircraft.2 The method takes into account the concentrated loads from wing- mounted engines (if present) and is applicable to multi-tapered swept wing geometry.>>>
<<<It accounts for different materials used in the structural framework.>>>
<<<The method is long and complex and should therefore be used when the aircraft configuration is frozen (i.e.>>>
<<<at the end of the preliminary project phase).>>>
<<<Wing flaps, etc.>>>
<<<For initial stages of the design process when details of the flaps, etc.>>>
<<<are unknown the following typical values may be assumed.>>>
<<<Trailing edge flap mass ranges from about 70-20 kg/m2 with the lower values related to simple flap mechanisms with small chord length.>>>
<<<Leading edge devices are about 30 kg/m2.>>>
<<<Spoilers and lift dumpers (air brakes) are about 15kg/m2.>>>
<<<A reduction of up to 20% can be assumed for the use of composite materials for control surfaces.>>>
<<<As more geometrical data is known the mass of the flap and other wing structures can be evaluated using the modified Torenbeek method3 as shown below: MFLAP = 2.706 x KFLAP x SFLAP x (BFLAJ> x SFLAP)01875 x [2.0 x FAIAS 2 x 10- 4 x sin(DFLAND)/TCWFf75 where: BFLAP = flap span (m) iSpLAp = flap area (sq.>>>

<<<Other factors.>>>
<<<For aircraft with rear fuselage mounted engines the wing mass (M w) will be increased due to the lack of inertia relief on the wing structure (cf.>>>
<<<R on p. 134).>>>
<<<For aircraft with a fuselage-mounted main undercarriage, the wing mass (M w) should be reduced by 5% to account for simplified (less stressed) inner structure.>>>
<<<Tail group (Mx) Although tail mass is not a large fraction of MTOM9 it is necessary to evaluate it accurately because it is positioned well aft of the aircraft centre of gravity.>>>
<<<The tail mass will therefore affect the overall balance of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Typical values of the mass ratio MT/MT0M range from 1.5 to 3.0% with 2% being a good initial guess.>>>
<<<More accurately the tail mass may be considered as the sum of the horizontal surfaces (tailplane, elevator, stabiliser) and the vertical surfaces (fin, rudder): Mj= MH + My where: Mn = mass of horizontal tail surfaces = <SH/cH M v = mass of vertical tail surfaces = SYkY Sn and Sw are total tail areas (i.e.>>>
<<<tailplane plus elevator, fin plus rudder).>>>
<<<fcH and ky are determined from statistical data of existing aircraft.>>>
<<<Values range between 22 and 32kg/m2 with fcH = 25 and fcv = 28 being typical values.>>>
<<<For tail con- figurations with higher than normal span and for large areas, the higher values should be substituted.>>>
<<<Add 10% to the above figures for fully variable tee-tails.>>>
<<<When more details are known an analysis similar to the main wing mass estimation can be used.>>>
<<<The above analysis is based on conventional aluminium structures.>>>
<<<If modern composite materials are used the mass may be reduced by 20%.>>>
<<<Body (fuselage) mass (M B) The mass of the body is obviously dependent on the size of the fuselage, the aircraft layout (e.g.>>>
<<<engine and undercarriage positions) and operational aspects (large cargo or freight doors).>>>
<<<Typical values for the ratio (MB/MTOM) range from 7 to 12% with the higher figure associated with smaller executive-style aircraft.>>>
<<<There are many different methods of more accurately estimating body mass but the formula recommended for civil aircraft (50-300 seats) is the Howe4 formula below: MB = 0.039 (LF x 2 x DF x F0 05)15 where: LF = fuselage overall length DF = fuselage diameter (or equivalent diameter) VD = aircraft maximum speed (design driving speed) It is recommended that the above mass be amended as follows: increased 8% for pressurised cabin increased 4% for fuselage mounted engines increased 7% for fuselage mounted main undercarriage increased 10% for large cargo door (etc.)>>>
<<<discontinuity reduced 4% if the fuselage is free from structural discontinuity All the available methods are based on historical data so care must be taken when applying them to novel or very large (e.g.>>>
<<<twin-deck) designs.>>>
<<<Nacelle mass ( M N ) Mass items to be attributed to the nacelle group are difficult to specify since some of the structure may be regarded as part of the wing, body, propulsion, or undercarriage groups.>>>
<<<Care must be taken when assigning detailed esti- mates to avoid double accounting of mass items with other component mass groups.>>>
<<<Typical values for the mass ratio (MN/MTOM) are 1.2 to 2.2%.>>>
<<<The nacelle mass is proportional to the size of the engine and the type of cowling specified (short, three-quarter, or full).>>>
<<<In the initial design stages an estimate of the installed (required) thrust will have been made but the engine configuration may not be known.>>>
<<<Details of the nacelle mass for some existing aircraft are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<7.4.>>>
<<<The 'best fit' quadratic function shows a 98% correlation with the data.>>>
<<<To simplify the calculation this function can be approximated to the linear function shown below: M N = 6.8 x T (for T < 600 kN) = 2760 + (2.2 x T) (for T > 600 kN) where: T = total installed take-off static sea-level, SL thrust (kN) The values calculated above should be slightly reduced if a short length bypass duct is used and increased for full length ducting.>>>

<<<Landing gear mass ( M u c ) The mass of the undercarriage will depend on the specified maximum landing mass and the rough field landing capability of the aircraft.>>>
<<<In the initial design stages decisions will not have been taken on the landing mass specification.>>>
<<<To avoid the need for fuel dumping many aircraft are now designed for a landing weight close to the maximum take-off weight.>>>
<<<When no other information is available use the aircraft MTOM value as used in the expression below.>>>
<<<As most airlines are operated from good quality paved runways the main variation lies in the degree of complication, and the degree of compactness necessary (i.e.>>>

<<<For a new aircraft design the landing gear is expected to weigh less than given by the above expression (assume 4.35%MTOM).>>>
<<<(Of course this saving will be associated with a slight cost increase for the landing gear.)>>>
<<<Aircraft configuration will affect the design of the undercarriage and therefore its weight.>>>

<<<Surface controls (M s c) The surface controls include all the movable surfaces on the wing that have not been included in the flap mass calculation.>>>
<<<The group includes all the internal wing controls and the controls for external leading edge devices (e.g.>>>
<<<slats/slots) and lift dumpers/air brakes.>>>
<<<It accounts for between 1 and 2% of the MTOM.>>>
<<<Figure 7.6 shows values for some current aircraft.>>>
<<<Although there is some scatter in the data the function below gives a 90% correlation: M s c = 0.4 MTOM06*4 The expression above assumes conventional aircraft configurations.>>>
<<<If more complex or extensive leading edge flap system or lift dumpers are specified the value should be increased.>>>
<<<For simple control systems (e.g.>>>

<<<2 Structure mass ratio (MSTR) The sum of the above masses (wing, tail, body, undercarriage and surface controls) is called the aircraft structural mass.>>>
<<<The ratio (MSTR/MTOM) will usually lie in the range 30 to 35% for conventional layouts.>>>

<<<It is therefore necessary to base estimates on the bare engines mass.>>>
<<<The mass of the bare engines may be assumed to be proportional to the static take-off thrust /weight ratio for similar types of engine.>>>
<<<For current large turbofan engines the specific mass is a function of bypass ratio as shown below.>>>
<<<The relationship in Fig.>>>

<<<Figure 7.8 shows values from some current aircraft.>>>

<<<[refer to the mass statement on pp.>>>

<<<The items  to be included depend on operational practices and aircraft specification.>>>
<<<Various textbooks and aircraft manuals list the actual masses for components in this mass group for a variety of different aircraft.>>>

<<<Advances in computer and control systems technology will change the size and mass of systems considerably.>>>
<<<Indi- vidual components have been 'miniaturised' but to offset this advantage more extensive systems will be installed; for example increased electrical demand requires a larger auxiliary power unit than on older aircraft.>>>
<<<You are advised to consider this mass group in detail as soon as the aircraft system information and specification is known so that a check can be made on the value assumed from the ratio above.>>>
<<<S Operational items mass (MOP) Some of the operational items are specific to the type of aircraft and other operational practices and must be assessed individually.>>>
<<<The following general data may be used (airline standard): • Crew provisions including maps and reference manuals.>>>
<<<Allow 10 kg total although with the introduction of on-line computer stored data this could be reduced (e.g.>>>

<<<Minimum numbers are set by the airworthiness authorities.>>>
<<<For a conventional aircraft a minimum of two flight crew will be necessary but this must be increased for long-haul (duration) flights to allow the pilots rest periods.>>>
<<<The number of cabin staff will be a function of the seating layout and the emergency evacuation process.>>>
<<<For normal scheduled services allow one attendant for 30-40 economy-class seats, one for 20-25 business-class seats, and one for each 10-15 first-class passengers.>>>
<<<Allow 93 kg for each flight crew member and 63 kg for each of the cabin staff (presumably they are usually much slimmer!).>>>
<<<E Mass of pay load (MPAY) The payload (i.e.>>>
<<<passengers, baggage, freight) will be set by the aircraft specification (payload/range).>>>
<<<The number of passengers to be carried in each class and the extra cargo will form part of the design brief.>>>
<<<The range over which this load is to be flown is also likely to be specified.>>>
<<<This range will need to be related to a fuel load, taking into account reserve fuel and contingencies.>>>
<<<Some items may be particular to the type of aircraft and its operation.>>>
<<<The following data may be used for general (civil transport) assessments: passengers (including carry on baggage) - 75 kg each extra baggage (tourist) - 20 kg (other classes) - 30 kg each passenger (Note: Baggage density is 192kg/m3.>>>
<<<This dictates the space required in the cargo holds for passenger luggage but extra volume will be required for the specified freight load.)>>>
<<<Mass of fuel(MF) The mass of fuel to be carried is related to the design payload/range specification for the aircraft.>>>
<<<Reserve and contingency allowances will be added to the fuel needed to fly the operation, to allow for any flight diversions and hold and to provide for adverse weather or for other extra fuel use.>>>
<<<The total (maximum) fuel will be limited by the size of the available fuel tanks.>>>
<<<The density of fuel used in aircraft engines varies according to the type.>>>
<<<Specific gravity will be between 0.77 and 0.82 kg/litre, with an average value of 0.80 typical.>>>
<<<With an assumed density and a calculated amount of fuel required a check must be made on the volume required and this compared to the available space in the wings (etc.)>>>
<<<to hold fuel.>>>
<<<SS Aircraft maximum takeoff mass (MTOM) The maximum take-off mass for the aircraft will be equal to the sum of the aircraft empty mass, operational items mass, payload and the fuel mass.>>>
<<<The MTOM will assume a combination of payload and fuel load appropriate to the design specification.>>>
<<<The aircraft will be designed to fly safely at this value of MTOM and the Certificate of Airworthiness will permit operation of the aircraft up to but not beyond this limit.>>>

<<<These are operational considerations relating to the service to be flown.>>>
<<<The component mass list allows various mass items to be grouped together and this has led to a variety of definitions for different conditions of the aircraft (e.g.>>>

<<<Lift and drag estimates Objectives A knowledge of the lift and drag characteristics of the aircraft is fundamental to determination of its flying qualities.>>>
<<<This chapter describes how lift and drag can be derived from a known aircraft geometry and conversely, how the selection of aircraft layout influences the generation of lift and drag.>>>
<<<As the fuselage shape is predetermined by the payload requirements, the nacelle geometry by the engine size, and the tail surfaces by stability considerations, the wing parameters are the principal variables to be considered in respect to lift and drag aspects.>>>
<<<To this end, guidance is given on the selection of wing section profile and planform geometry to provide specified performance requirements.>>>
<<<A drag estimation method covering all the aircraft components (fuselage, nacelle, wing and tail surfaces) is also provided.>>>
<<<Such methods are suitable for use in the conceptual design phase and provide an introduction to more detailed estimation procedures for later design stages.>>>
<<<Introduction The ability to estimate the lift and drag capability of the aircraft in various configurations (e.g.>>>
<<<aircraft mass and flap variations) and in different flight conditions (e.g.>>>
<<<cruise, climb, take-off, landing) is fundamental to the process of aircraft design.>>>
<<<All components (e.g.>>>
<<<wing, fuselage, tail, engine) will need to be considered in the total estimation process but the wing is the most significant.>>>
<<<Fuselage shape and size is mainly determined by the requirements associated with the payload (e.g.>>>
<<<passenger seating arrangements, cargo container sizes).>>>
<<<Nacelle shape is associated with engine geometry and flow requirements into and away from the core engine.>>>
<<<Tail sizing is mostly a function of stability and control requirements.>>>
<<<On the other hand the wing size and shape has considerable impact on the lift and drag of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Careful selection of the wing geometrical features will be a central issue in the design of the aircraft to meet lift requirements and to reduce overall drag.>>>
<<<As many of the issues in this process have been discussed in Chapter 6, only those aspects directly related to the estimation of lift and drag are discussed here.>>>
<<<Lift and drag forces on the aircraft are determined as the vertical (normal to the flight direction) and horizontal (along the flight direction) components of the overall pressure field around the aircraft.>>>
<<<As such it is not surprising that lift and drag are not independent parameters.>>>
<<<As we shall see in the estimation process drag will be assessed partly as a function of shape and surface condition (profile drag component) and partly as a function of lift (lift induced drag component).>>>
<<<The generation of sufficient lift for a flight condition may require changes in wing profile (e.g.>>>
<<<flap deployment).>>>
<<<Such changes will have considerable impact on drag evaluation.>>>
<<<The overall pressure distribution around the aircraft will also contribute a pitching moment about the point which the lift and drag components are assumed to act.>>>
<<<This pitching moment will vary for different aircraft configurations (e.g.>>>
<<<flap and undercarriage deployment) and must be considered when the balance of forces on the aircraft is assessed as it will be one of the major contributors to the requirement for tail size and efficiency.>>>
<<<The sections below describe initially the inter-relationship of wing shape with the generation of lift and drag and subsequently a method of estimating lift and drag for the whole aircraft from a knowledge of the component geometry.>>>
<<<Wing geometry selection Assuming that the gross wing area required for the aircraft has been determined from initial estimates (see Chapter 11), there are two geometrical parameters to be determined; namely, the aerofoil section profile and the wing planform shape.>>>
<<<Three operational cases need to be considered when making these selections; the wing must be efficient in the en-route (cruise) configuration; it must have sufficient lift generation capability in the take-off and landing configurations (i.e.>>>
<<<with flaps deployed), and it must have the lowest possible drag in the critical engine-out certification climb segments after take-off.>>>
<<<Aerofoil section profile The detailed specification of aerofoil profile shape requires the definition of wing chord length, camber shape, maximum thickness and the leading edge, LE, radius as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.1.>>>
<<<To generalise the geometry, the lengths are non- dimensionalised by dividing each parameter by the chord length to create a ratio (e.g.>>>
<<<thickness/chord ratio).>>>
<<<The sectional shape will vary along the wing span to provide smooth chordwise flow conditions over the different parts of the wing and to guard against outboard (tip) stalling of the wing.>>>
<<<Aerofoil section data available at the conceptual design stage will be related to two-dimensional flows over a constant section shape.>>>
<<<This data will need to be modified to take account of three-dimensional flow conditions and to integrate the changing section shapes along the wing span.>>>
<<<Thickness (t) Camber (y) Mean camber line Chord (c) Radius (r) Non-dimensional parameters; Camber = ylc Thickness = tic LE.>>>
<<<radius -rlc Fig.>>>
<<<8.1 Section geometry definition.>>>
<<<The wing section shape will determine the maximum practicable lift coefficient CL, the stall characteristics, the lift curve shape (CL versus wing incidence, a), the profile drag, the critical Mach number and the shape and extent of compressibility drag rise.>>>
<<<All these criteria are important as they dictate overall aircraft operational and design parameters.>>>
<<<For example, the maximum lift capability of the clean wing will dictate the type and size of high-lift devices necessary to meet the field performance requirements (e.g.>>>
<<<approach speed); the lift curve shape will determine the wing incidence in the cruise phase and thereby the fuselage to wing setting angle to minimise the aircraft overall drag; and the drag rise curve will dictate the maximum cruise speed with engines at the cruise setting.>>>
<<<In general, sections with a high thickness/chord ratio and high camber give high maximum lift coefficient but they lead to higher drag and a lower critical Mach number (lower cruise speed).>>>
<<<All modern turbofan aircraft have section shapes known as 'super-critical'.>>>
<<<These are designed to have positive pressure gradients up to about the half chord position.>>>
<<<This helps to delay the formation of local shock waves on the upper surface.>>>
<<<Such profiles have high values for critical Mach number (about 0.06 Mach number increase over a conventional section of similar thickness/chord ratio) but lose out slightly on the generation of maximum lift.>>>
<<<A more detailed account of sectional geometry changes can be found in standard textbooks on aerodynamics and wing section design.>>>
<<<Wing planform geometry The planform of a wing, for a given gross area, is defined by the geometric parameters, aspect ratio, taper ratio and sweepback.>>>
<<<These are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.2(a).>>>
<<<Many wing planforms incorporate a cranked trailing edge (see Fig.>>>
<<<8.2(b)).>>>
<<<This improves the efficiency of the flap and moves the centre of lift of the wing closer to the centre of the aircraft creating a lighter wing structure.>>>
<<<For initial design studies it is sometimes necessary to avoid such complications in the planform geometry and to approximate the total area to an equivalent straight tapered shape as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.2(b).>>>
<<<The choice of the wing thickness and planform parameters is discussed in Chapter 6.>>>

<<<The factor Ca in the above relationship reflects the influence of wing camber on the design lift coefficient.>>>
<<<For super-critical sections where the deviation of the aerofoil meanline is zero (near zero) until at least 70% of the wing chord, Ca may be taken as 1.0.>>>
<<<For conventional sections where camber is distributed along the aerofoil chord, values of Ca will vary from 1.02 and 1.05 for low camber sections to 1.05 and 1.15 for significantly cambered sections.>>>
<<<Some guidance on likely values for Ca for conventional sections is given in Table 8.1.>>>

<<<The angle of attack at which the two curves coincide will indicate the spanwise position of the start of the wing stall.>>>
<<<The maximum lift coefficient achieved by the wing will always be less than the section maximum value as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<A typical relationship is shown below: ( C W ) 3 D = 0 .>>>
<<<9 ( C I I M I ) 2 D X ( C O S A ) Modern turbofan aircraft have a clean wing maximum lift coefficient of about 1.5 when taking into account the above effects.>>>
<<<Without other consideration such a value would result in a very large wing area to meet the field and climb requirements.>>>
<<<To increase the maximum wing lift coefficient, high-lift devices are used.>>>
<<<Effect of high-lift devices High-lift devices generally fall into two categories: trailing edge (TE) devices and leading edge (LE) devices.>>>
<<<Trailing edge devices decrease the zero lift angle and thus increase the lift for a given angle of attack as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.5.>>>
<<<Several flap types are available.>>>
<<<These range from the simple split flaps to complex triple-slotted flaps.>>>
<<<A selection of trailing flaps is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.6.>>>
<<<Trailing edge flaps are of two types; those that do not increase the chord of the wing and those that employ chord extension.>>>
<<<The latter type are termed Fowler flaps.>>>

<<<The maximum lift increment for a simple flap typically occurs at a deflection angle of 50°.>>>
<<<Above this angle the flow separates and extra lift is lost.>>>
<<<To increase the lift increment further, double- and triple-slotted flaps are often employed.>>>
<<<Each section is deflected at a greater angle to increase lift whilst preventing separation of the flow.>>>
<<<However, such double- and triple-slotted flaps increase mechanical com- plexity and wing mass.>>>

<<<Leading edge devices increase the maximum lift on the wing by preventing wing leading edge stall increasing the maximum angle of attack as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<As with trailing edge flaps, there are several different types of leading edge devices available as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<8.8.>>>
<<<Fixed slat Retractable slat Nose flap Krueger flap Fig.>>>
<<<8.8 Types of leading edge devices.>>>
<<<Most modern civil transports have full span leading edge slats whilst older designs normally have inboard Krueger flaps and outboard leading edge slats.>>>
<<<Slats work by increasing the camber and chord of the wing.>>>
<<<The increment in lift produced is limited by the subsequent stall at the trailing edge flaps.>>>
<<<Krueger flaps increase lift in a similar way to slats but without increasing the wing chord.>>>
<<<They are sometimes used on the inboard section of wings, with slats used outboard for their favourable pitch characteristics and to help prevent tip stall.>>>
<<<It should be noted that leading edge devices are often interrupted along the span by engine pylon structures which reduce their effectiveness.>>>
<<<All leading edge devices increase mechanical complexity of the wing and thereby mass and cost.>>>

<<<Lift curve slope The lift curve slope is important as it affects the aircraft angle of attack in the take-off and landing configurations and also the setting of the wing relative to the fuselage.>>>
<<<In the take-off case the angle of attack with the take-off flap lowered to an angle which develops sufficient lift for lift-off is required.>>>
<<<A check can then be made that the aircraft geometry and undercarriage position are such that this angle of attack can be achieved on rotation.>>>
<<<In the landing configuration the angle of attack is needed to establish that the pilot's view meets the appropriate air- worthiness criteria.>>>
<<<A knowledge of the lift curve slope in cruise is required so that the wing attitude relative to the fuselage can be set such that the fuselage is approximately level and at a low-drag altitude during cruise.>>>

<<<Further corrections are also required due to the position of the fuselage relative to the wing configuration (i.e.>>>
<<<high-, mid- or low-) and for the effect of sweep.>>>
<<<A more accurate method of determining lift curve slope is given by ESDU.3 Drag estimation Each main component of the aircraft (wing, fuselage, tail surfaces, nacelles; and in the low speed flight phases the flaps and undercarriage) must be separately assessed for its contribution to the overall drag of the aircraft.2 It is not sufficient to consider only the wing effects in the estimation of drag.>>>
<<<For subsonic civil aircraft the overall drag of the aircraft can be considered under three categories: 1. profile drag resulting from the pressure field around the shape and from the surface skin friction effects of the boundary layer; 2. lift induced drag resulting from the changes in pressure due to attitude variations resulting from the generation of lift; 3. wave drag from shock waves as parts of the accelerated flow over the surfaces become supersonic.>>>
<<<These effects result in the following formations for aircraft drag coefficient: CD — CDo + CD.>>>
<<<+ ACDW where: CDo = estimated total profile drag coefficient (i.e.>>>

<<<Estimating the drag of a nacelle is complicated by the intricate geometry of many nacelles and the inter-relationship with the definition of engine thrust.>>>

<<<(vi) For the flaps.>>>
<<<The drag due to the high-lift systems depends upon the types of trailing edge and leading edge flaps envisaged for the aircraft under con- sideration.>>>
<<<As was noted earlier there are several possibilities, from plain flaps to area extending flaps all with one, two or three slots.>>>
<<<The method suggested for use at the preliminary design stage covers area extending flaps such as: • Fowler type with one, two or three slots; • flaps with offset hinge and a linkage to give some area extension at low flap angles again with one or two slots and plain flaps with offset hinge with one or two slots.>>>

<<<There are several published methods for estimating wetted area of the various components but all rely on the detailed definition of the layout.>>>
<<<When you know the shape of the component it is relatively easy to make a detailed estimate of the wetted area of the part using your own initiative.>>>
<<<Some performance calculations are done with one engine failed.>>>
<<<In such a condition the aircraft will be subjected to drag increases from the flow blockage of the failed engine and the extra drag from the asymmetric flight attitude of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The drag increment from the engine, known as the windmill drag, can be estimated from ACD = 0.3 Af/S (where A{ is the area of the fan cross section, and -S is the wing reference area).>>>

<<<The best (lowest induced drag) loading consists of a smooth elliptical distribution from wing tip to tip with no discontinuities due to fuselage, nacelles, flaps, etc.>>>
<<<Obviously, except for high performance sailplanes, it is not feasible to arrange the aircraft layout to get such a spanwise load distribution.>>>
<<<The comments below will help you to estimate the lift dependent drag coefficient for civil aircraft.>>>

<<<Without the assistance of powerful computer fluid flow analysis it is difficult to predict these effects accurately.>>>
<<<An empirical analysis of conventional civil aircraft geometry and operating conditions shows that the contribution to dCD/dCL is proportional to aircraft profile drag.>>>
<<<The following relationship is appropriate for current wing geometry.>>>
<<<dCD/dCL = 0.35 CDo (for older technology designs) dCD/dCL = O.15CDo (for advanced technology designs) The older technology value seems to work well for B737-300, B757 and B767, the A320 lies in between the two values and the A330/340 and B777 match the advanced technology value.>>>
<<<Hence the total lift dependent drag coefficient for the aircraft is the sum of the three effects: Wave drag dCD/dC2 L = C1C2ZnA + 0.0004 + O.15CDo As civil aircraft are designed to be operated away from the worst effects of wave drag rise it is acceptable to use a simple addition to the aircraft drag when operating at speeds greater than M 0.7 (e.g.>>>

<<<Introduction Current high bypass ratio turbofan engines are thermodynamically much more efficient than the early turbojet and low bypass types.>>>
<<<This has been largely brought about by the introduction of advanced technologies which have enabled turbine blades to withstand high centrifugal loads whilst operating in gas temperatures considerably higher than the melting point of the unprotected blade material.>>>
<<<The Chairman of Rolls Royce once summed this up by saying high pressure turbine blades operate at temperatures roughly 3000C above the melting point of the metal from which they are constructed .>>>
<<<.>>>
<<<.>>>
<<<additionally each blade experiences a centrifugal load equivalent to having a double-decker bus hanging on it.>>>
<<<Many technologies are brought to bear to enable an engine to be designed that is safe and has a service life acceptable to the airlines.>>>
<<<In the following paragraphs the factors that influence the choice of engine characteristics are discussed.>>>
<<<To illustrate the underlying principles a simplified approach has been adopted.>>>
<<<The choice of powerplant will depend upon the duty required of it by the particular aircraft and the associated cost.>>>
<<<A cost efficient engine will have: • low initial price • low maintenance cost • low weight • high reliability • high fuel efficiency • assuming it is a podded engine, a low wetted area This categorisation is somewhat of an oversimplification because there is an interdependency between all these items.>>>
<<<The first four items will be largely a func- tion of the mechanical design of the engine whereas the last two items are mainly influenced by the engine cycle and its internal operating efficiency.>>>
<<<The engine cycle is defined by the bypass ratio, pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.>>>
<<<On large aircraft the fuel price accounts for some 30% of the aircraft direct operating costs.>>>
<<<High fuel efficiency is therefore a major factor in such aircraft designs.>>>
<<<Improving fuel efficiency will not only have a direct saving on aircraft fuel cost but will also have an indirect effect due to the reduced fuel mass to be carried.>>>
<<<A more fuel efficient engine will require less fuel to fly a given range and hence will lead to a lower take-off weight and a general scaling down of the aircraft and engine size.>>>
<<<This is sometimes referred to as the 'snowball' effect.>>>
<<<Due to the reduced take- off weight and smaller engine size, the aircraft first cost, depreciation charges, insurance charges, landing fees and maintenance charges will all be reduced.>>>
<<<Thus a very powerful cost saving process stems from improving the engine efficiency.>>>
<<<Engine cycle The parameters that define the engine cycle have been mentioned above.>>>
<<<Before proceeding these parameters need to be defined.>>>
<<<• Bypass ratio This is the ratio of the air passing through the bypass duct to the air passing through the gas generator (e.g.>>>
<<<a bypass ratio of 5 has a total airflow of 6 units, 5 of which go through the bypass duct and 1 of which goes through the gas generator).>>>
<<<• Pressure ratio This is the ratio of the air pressure at the entry to the engine to the pressure at the outlet of the compression system (i.e.>>>
<<<as it enters the combustion section).>>>
<<<• Turbine entry temperature This is the gas temperature at the entry to the first turbine stage in the engine.>>>
<<<• A parameter which depends on the combination of the above characteristics is called the specific thrust.>>>
<<<This is defined as the amount of thrust per unit airflow: (thrust) divided by (engine total air mass flow) Engine thrust Since reference will be made to engine thrust in the sections describing the various efficiencies of the engine it will be helpful to define this term.>>>
<<<Engine thrust results from the change in momentum of the air through the engine plus any pressure thrust due to the static pressure ratio across the final (exhaust) nozzle.>>>
<<<The change of momentum of the air through the engine is given by: M ty-V0)/g where: M = air flow through the engine Vj = velocity of the exhaust jet V0 = velocity of the air entering the engine g = gravitational acceleration Pressure thrust is given by: (p - po)A where: (p — p0) = pressure difference at the nozzle A = the nozzle cross-sectional area Fig.>>>
<<<9.1 The derivation of nett thrust (source ref.>>>
<<<1).>>>
<<<engine thrust = If the final nozzle is unchoked (i.e.>>>
<<<not at supersonic speed) the nozzle pressure term disappears and the thrust becomes: M(Vj-V0)Jg In the case of a choked nozzle, with Vj representing the jet velocity when the flow is fully expanded to atmospheric pressure (p0), the nozzle pressure term again disappears and the thrust also becomes: M(Vi-V0)Zg to as the momentum drag.>>>
<<<The term The term MV0/g is often referred (MVj/g) + (p — P0)A is called the gross thrust.>>>
<<<The difference between the gross thrust and momentum drag is referred to as the nett thrust.>>>
<<<Main factors influencing fuel efficiency Fuel consumption is directly linked to engine efficiency.>>>
<<<The higher the overall efficiency, the lower is the fuel consumption of the engine per unit thrust.>>>
<<<The overall engine efficiency can be broken down into three main components: • the power producing component (i.e.>>>
<<<the gas generator); • the transmission system which conveys the power from the gas generator to the propulsive jet; • the propulsive jet system.>>>
<<<The overall efficiency can be written as: % = fth xr1txrlv where: qth = thermal efficiency of the gas generator rjt = transmission efficiency rjv = propulsive efficiency of the jet Each of these efficiencies will be discussed.>>>
<<<Thermal efficiency It can be shown that: „„,= 1 - ( 0 W -(!/»*)] where: r = overall pressure ratio of the engine thermodynamic cycle including any intake ram pressure rise n = function of the gas constant y Therefore, the higher the pressure ratio, the higher will be the thermal efficiency.>>>
<<<Consequently the specific fuel consumption will be lower.>>>
<<<However, it should be noted that available turbine materials and turbine cooling techniques limit the maximum pressure ratio.>>>
<<<Providing cooling air can negate the effect of higher pressure ratio due to the higher temperatures of the cooling air from the compressor.>>>
<<<For small engines there will also be a limit due to the practicalities of engineering the blades for the final compressor stages.>>>
<<<Transmission efficiency Transmission efficiency can be determined from: ( I + H ) V IfVtJ where: \x — bypass ratio rj{ = fan efficiency rjt = turbine efficiency If fan and turbine efficiencies were 100% then the transmission efficiency would also be 100%.>>>
<<<The transmission efficiency therefore depends primarily upon the fan and turbine efficiencies.>>>
<<<These are determined by the current material and manu- facturing technologies that are available.>>>
<<<Propulsive efficiency Propulsive efficiency can be determined from: where: V0 = the aircraft velocity Xn = the engine thrust M = the engine airflow XJM is referred to as the specific thrust Lower specific thrust means higher propulsive efficiency; however, the lower the specific thrust for the same overall pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature the larger will be the fan diameter for a given thrust.>>>
<<<Large fan diameters mean more weight for both engine and nacelle and more aircraft drag.>>>
<<<However, due to the improved propulsion efficiency, there will be an improvement in the engine specific fuel consumption (SFC).>>>
<<<(SFC is the amount of fuel burned per unit time per unit thrust -Ib/hr/Ib or in SI units kg/hr/Newton.)>>>
<<<Let us assume flight above the tropopause where the ambient temperature is constant (at this height the speed of sound is 295 m/s in ISA conditions [see Data D]).>>>
<<<For simplicity, assume that the engine hot and cold jet stream velocities are equal then the equation above gives: where: Xn — the nett thrust in Newtons M = the engine mass flow in kg/sec The above expression is sometimes quoted in imperial units in which thrust is in pounds, mass flow in Ib/sec, velocity in ft/sec.>>>
<<<If W is the mass flow in Ib/sec then M in the above formula needs to be replaced by W/g thus giving: 2Mn-a % = x ^.g + TMn-a where: Xn/W = specific thrust a = speed of sound In the tropopause, a = 968 ft/sec and g = 32.2ft/sec2, giving: __ Mn-968 0 = 322 ^ 60Mn /p \ (X (^+ WMHJ where thrust (Xn) is in pounds force and 'mass' flow (W) is in Ib/sec.>>>
<<<Propulsive efficiency is sometimes shown to be a function of bypass ratio.>>>
<<<This is only true for engines of the same overall pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature.>>>
<<<Engines of differing bypass ratio can have the same specific thrust and hence the same propulsive efficiency as shown in Table 9.1.>>>
<<<Nevertheless, in defining engine performance and efficiency, the term specific thrust will be used in this chapter.>>>
<<<The above values for specific thrust are those related to the take-off rating.>>>
<<<Currently the design point for engines of this type is at the top of climb where the specific thrust will be much lower, for the engines below it will be about 16.>>>
<<<Bypass ratio will still be used on occasions as it does describe the flow split between the bypass stream and the gas generator.>>>

<<<However, for the same thrust requirement reducing specific thrust will increase the fan diameter.>>>
<<<The mass of the basic engine will therefore increase and the engine nacelle will become larger, heavier and create more drag.>>>
<<<The nett result will be a reduced engine efficiency improvement with increased engine size.>>>

<<<Specific fuel consumption and flight speed The specific fuel consumption is defined as the rate of fuel consumption per unit of thrust.>>>
<<<If we assume a 100% efficient engine then the ideal fuel consumption is: SFCideal = (heat equivalent of aircraft work)/(calorific value of fuel x thrust) Example Using fuel with a calorific value of 10 000 CHU/Ib and assuming flight above the tropopause in a standard atmosphere (i.e.>>>

<<<1.35582), then the ideal specific fuel consumption becomes: aircraft work per hour = thrust x velocity = thrust x Mach no.>>>
<<<x 968 x 3600 x 1.35582 Joule/hr Converting CHU to Joule (using 1899.11): (calorific value of fuel x thrust) = (10000 x 1899.11 x thrust) Substituting the values above into the ideal SFC equation we get:  Typically, for an aircraft flying above the tropopause at Mn = 0.84, the ideal SFC will be about 0.21.>>>
<<<Actual SFC for an engine with an overall efficiency of r]o becomes: - SFCMeai _ Mn ?j?r S F C ^ - - ^ - - — Modern large high bypass ratio turbofans have SFCs in the range 0.55-0.6.>>>
<<<This implies overall efficiency (rj0) in the range 35-40%.>>>
<<<Factors governing choice of engine cycle The choice of engine cycle (i.e.>>>
<<<engine pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and specific thrust) is determined by a process of arriving at the best compromise between engine specific fuel consumption, engine weight and price.>>>
<<<The criteria at the initial design stage will be either in terms of direct operating cost of the aircraft or the capital cost of acquiring the aircraft.>>>
<<<The aircraft mission is important in this consideration.>>>
<<<Long-range aircraft will be more sensitive to changes in specific fuel consumption due to the 'snowball' effect from fuel mass.>>>
<<<On the other hand, short-range aircraft will be more sensitive to engine cost than to the specific fuel consumption.>>>
<<<In such an aircraft it may not be appropriate to employ the highest bypass ratio and pressure ratio possible along with the highest turbine entry temperature capability as these lead to increased complexity and hence higher cost and weight.>>>
<<<For example, Table 9.2 compares the powerplants for the Fokker FlOO (a typical short-range aircraft) and the B-141 with two different engines (a typical long-range aircraft).>>>
<<<On the long-range aircraft fuel efficiency is the main driver.>>>
<<<In this case the engine overall efficiency needs to be the highest practicable (within current technology constraints).>>>
<<<The best thermal efficiency is obtained first of all by designing for the highest component efficiency (i.e.>>>
<<<compressor and turbines); this will then determine the pressure ratio to give the highest efficiency.>>>
<<<The turbine entry temperature will be determined by the turbine material properties and the blade cooling technology.>>>
<<<The higher the turbine entry temperature, in general, the higher the thrust.>>>
<<<So one of the major effects of high turbine temperatures is to keep the overall size and weight of the engine down for a given thrust.>>>

<<<transmission efficiency is obtained by maximising the fan and turbine efficiencies.>>>
<<<The propulsive efficiency is at its highest when the average jet velocity is at its lowest.>>>
<<<Low jet velocities imply high bypass ratio or low specific thrust.>>>
<<<The choice of bypass ratio or specific thrust is determined by balancing the improvement in propulsive efficiency against the increase in weight, drag and cost as bypass ratio and thereby the size of the engine is increased.>>>
<<<The effect of engine parameters on aircraft direct operating cost (DOC) is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.6.>>>
<<<Considering the effect of engine SFC alone produces a low value for optimum specific thrust (e.g.>>>
<<<3.01bf/lb/sec in the example).>>>
<<<However, as specific thrust decreases, installation drag, aircraft mass and aircraft price increase.>>>
<<<When all effects are taken into account the optimum specific thrust value is much higher (e.g.>>>
<<<14.0 in the example).>>>
<<<Engine performance The engine performance data will contain thrust, fuel flow and airflow.>>>
<<<Fuel flow is often in the form of a specific fuel consumption (i.e.>>>
<<<fuel flow per unit thrust).>>>
<<<Thrust and fuel flow are obviously required in order to calculate the aircraft performance.>>>
<<<The airflow value is needed to design the engine intake so that the flow requirements of the engine can be met in all the important phases of the flight without excessive penalties (for example, due to spillage, i.e.>>>
<<<the intake providing more air than the engine requires).>>>
<<<The engine will also have certain rated thrust levels.>>>
<<<These ratings are set such that the engine can pass its certification type test and at the same time give an acceptable engine service life to the airlines.>>>
<<<These ratings are usually set by a turbine entry temperature limit and are summarised as follows.>>>
<<<• Take-off rating: is the maximum thrust rating and corresponds to the highest turbine entry temperature.>>>
<<<To protect engine service life this thrust level is normally cleared for only five minutes per flight but this can be increased to ten minutes to meet special cases.>>>
<<<• Maximum continuous: is the highest thrust rating for the engine cleared for continuous use.>>>
<<<It is only used in the event of a serious emergency condition.>>>
<<<Although it could be used for normal operations the engine service life would be unacceptably reduced.>>>
<<<• Maximum climb: is the maximum thrust used in normal climb • Maximum cruise: is the maximum thrust used in normal cruise Take-off and maximum continuous ratings are determined by the engine certification type test.>>>
<<<The maximum climb and maximum cruise ratings are set in conjunction with the required take-off rating to achieve a desired service life.>>>
<<<The term required take-off rating has been used quite deliberately as this may be less than the maximum take-off rating set by the type test.>>>
<<<It is possible that the selected ratings may not match specific aircraft operating requirements.>>>
<<<For example, an aircraft may need less take-off thrust but more climb and cruise thrust.>>>
<<<It is therefore possible to re-rate the engine to accommodate different combinations of rating while still achieving approximately the same engine service life.>>>
<<<This interplay between the engine ratings and the aircraft requirements is quite important in optimising the engine size and hence the powerplant weight and costs.>>>
<<<This compromise can only be achieved through a dialogue between the airframe manufacturer and the engine supplier.>>>
<<<The selection of the engine and its ratings plays an important role in the project design discussions between the engine and airframe companies.>>>
<<<Engines operating at a constant turbine entry temperature (TET) will lose thrust as the ambient temperature increases.>>>
<<<The engine control system for an engine which is 'flat rated' will progressively increase TET as the ambient temperature rises to maintain constant thrust.>>>
<<<Aircraft are often designed to meet specified hot day requirements (typically ISA+ 150C at take-off and ISA+ 100C at climb and cruise).>>>
<<<At day temperatures lower than these the engine thrust will increase and hence give the aircraft a performance superior to that at the design point.>>>
<<<This is not usually necessary so the engine is flat rated to increase the service life.>>>
<<<An example at take-off is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.7.>>>
<<<Flat rating also improves service life as only on a comparatively small number of occasions does the aircraft operate at or above the hot day design point.>>>
<<<The development of electronic control systems for engines has allowed airlines to de-rate the engines from the maximum ratings established above for both take- off and climb depending upon the aircraft operational requirements.>>>
<<<For example, the aircraft take-off weight may be less than the maximum, the runway available may be longer than that for which the aircraft has been designed, and the ambient temperature may be lower than the specification critical figure.>>>
<<<The required take- off thrust under these conditions, observing all the necessary safety margins, may Flat rating Constant turbine entry temperature t s u r h T Reducing TET Fig.>>>

<<<For aircraft with high bypass engines the excess take-off power available makes this option commonplace.>>>
<<<This is illustrated in Fig.>>>
<<<9.8.>>>
<<<In this way reducing thrust from the maximum permitted rating will lower turbine entry temperatures and thereby increase the service life of the engine.>>>
<<<In the case of climb, an aircraft operating at less than its maximum take-off mass may not need the maximum permitted climb rating to give an acceptable climb performance.>>>

<<<This is shown on Fig.>>>
<<<9.9 in terms of the improvement in specific fuel consumption.>>>
<<<It should be noted that the De Havilland Ghost engine used in the first jet- powered airline (the De Havilland Comet) paid a large price in cruise fuel efficiency compared to the then current piston and turboprop engines to gain the much higher cruise speed.>>>
<<<It was not until the introduction of the high bypass ratio turbofans with bypass ratios in the 4-6 range (e.g.>>>
<<<RB211, the JT9 and the CFF-6) that the lost fuel efficiency was regained.>>>
<<<One of the future engine developments which could give further improvements in cruise fuel efficiency would be the advanced turboprop or propfan.>>>
<<<However, despite considerable amount of research and development a propfan installation has not been produced that would show a significant benefit in direct operating costs to make it attractive to the airlines at current fuel prices.>>>
<<<There are still problems associated with noise and installation (particularly when wing-mounted) and the maximum cruise speed will be restricted to about Mn = 0.8 as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<Although Fig.>>>
<<<9.12 shows an under-wing layout the remarks below apply equally to rear fuselage installations.>>>
<<<The majority of new aircraft have externally podded engines installed under the wing and therefore this installation is considered in detail.>>>
<<<There are many issues involved in putting a nacelle around an engine.>>>
<<<These are listed below.>>>
<<<• Air must be delivered at conditions acceptable to the engine compressor system throughout the aircraft flight envelope.>>>
<<<• The nacelle must efficiently separate the air which passes through the engine from that which passes outside.>>>
<<<• The external nacelle flow must be such as to minimise the external drag.>>>
<<<• There must be an acceptable fairing down to the final exhaust nozzle.>>>
<<<• Sufficient space must be provided for the engine mechanical systems and accessories while at the same time minimising the impact on the nacelle profile.>>>
<<<• Provision is required for a thrust reverser and its associated systems.>>>
<<<• Sufficient acoustic lining area must be provided to enable the aircraft to meet the required noise rules, again with minimum impact on the nacelle profiles.>>>
<<<• Safety considerations require: 1. ventilation of various areas in the nacelle to prevent the build-up of dangerous gases and to control temperatures within ranges acceptable to the accessories; 2. fire detection and extinguishing systems in separate zones subject to a fire hazard; 3. fireproof bulkheads to enclose zones considered to be fire hazards.>>>
<<<• Accessibility for maintenance purposes is also required.>>>
<<<At the preliminary design stage it is not possible to cater for all these considerations in detail.>>>
<<<Derivation of pod geometry The geometry described here for the nacelle installation has been based on the analysis of existing aircraft installations covering the major aircraft manufacturers.>>>
<<<It covers two different types of installation (separated and mixed jets): • engines with separate jets installed in a pod with separate nozzles for the fan flow and core flow as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.13; • engine with mixed flows installed in a fully cowled pod as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.14.>>>
<<<The statistical data used for the analysis shown in Tables 9.3(a) and (b) was restricted mainly to wing-mounted powerplants.>>>
<<<However, some limited informa- tion on rear fuselage-mounted engines indicated that basic pod geometries may be derived using the data for lower bypass ratio engines.>>>
<<<Nacelle geometry is influenced by the position of accessories.>>>
<<<At the preliminary design stage it may not have been established whether the engine accessories should be mounted on the fan casing or on the core structure.>>>
<<<The nacelle geometry shown in this chapter will give typical nacelle geometry and will enable the effect of engines of different designs to be compared without consideration of mounting of accessories.>>>
<<<Figs 9.13 and 9.14 define the geometric parameters referred to in the following tables (Tables 9.3(a) and (b)).>>>

<<<Therefore with plug nozzle it can be shown that: D5 plug = 1.25 D3 (no plug).>>>
<<<Having defined the engine nacelle, it is now possible to install it on the airframe.>>>
<<<There are again many issues to be resolved.>>>
<<<These are listed below and shown in Figs 9.15 and 9.16.>>>
<<<• Gully depth.>>>
<<<This is the necessary clearance between the wing and the nacelle to ensure efficient wing aerodynamics with a low nacelle drag.>>>
<<<• Penetration.>>>
<<<This is the overlap of the final nozzle exhaust plane relative to the wing leading edge.>>>
<<<In conjunction with the gully depth it is chosen to minimise the powerplant interference drag.>>>
<<<• Intake highlight to ground clearance must be set high enough to avoid the formation of ground effect vortices which could cause losses due to fan flow distortion and injection of debris from the ground.>>>

<<<Rules for scaling an engine There are limits on the degree of scaling that can be sensibly carried out.>>>
<<<It would be impractical and inaccurate to scale an engine configuration from its baseline to 0.5 thrust scale.>>>
<<<For example, the size of the last stages of the compressor may be too small to be manufactured.>>>

<<<If engine thrust scale is x {i.e.>>>

<<<Dimensions scale by the square root of x, and engine and nacelle mass scale by x.>>>
<<<{i.e.>>>
<<<(engine thrust/engine mass) and (engine thrust/nacelle mass) ratios remain constant.}>>>
<<<These rules are only approximate; for example the combustion system dimen- sions do not depend solely upon the engine size but involve other parameters.>>>
<<<However, at the preliminary design stage these rules will give a reasonable first assessment of the weight and performance of a scaled engine.>>>

<<<Derivation of formulae The derivation of the formulae given in the early part of this chapter for the thermal, propulsive and transmission efficiencies are given below.>>>
<<<Thermal efficiency Gas turbines operate to a Joule (or Brayton) cycle.>>>
<<<It is this cycle that controls the thermal efficiency.>>>
<<<A simple cycle is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.22 which also defines the temperature T and pressure p at various sections.>>>
<<<Assuming ideal components (i.e.>>>
<<<100% compressor and turbine efficiencies, zero loss in the combustion system and an ideal gas) the thermal efficiency can be expressed as the ratio (nett work output)/(heat supplied): nett work output = Cp(T3 - T4) - Cp(T2 - T1) and heat supplied = CV(T3 - T2) where Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure with units of Joule/kg Kelvin.>>>
<<<Therefore: = (T3 - T4) - (T2 - T1) (T3 - T2) ^ From the isentropic relation between pressure and temperature we have: T tl — -Ky-I)/?]>>>
<<<_ T1 T Il T4 where y is the gas constant and r is the pressure ratio evaluated as: Defining the exponential in the above equation as: r = P2 = P1 Pi PA Compressor Combustion Turbine Fig.>>>
<<<9.22 A simple cycle.>>>
<<<Then thermal efficiency Defining Then where r is the pressure ratio of the engine thermodynamic cycle including any intake ram pressure rise at flight conditions and n is a function of the gas constant y.>>>
<<<Note that with ideal components the turbine operating temperature has no in- fluence on the thermal efficiency.>>>
<<<This does not hold true when realistic component efficiencies are introduced.>>>
<<<Figure 9.23 shows the effect of turbine entry temperature on engine thermal efficiency when realistic component efficiencies are considered.>>>
<<<Transmission efficiency Transmission efficiency for a bypass engine is a function of the fan turbine efficiency and fan efficiency and the bypass ratio.>>>
<<<Assume an engine with mixed exhausts and with the following characteristics: bypass ratio = /x core mass flow = M velocity achieved if the available core energy was expanded down to ambient pressure = Vc jet velocity = V1 fan turbine efficiency = rjt fan efficiency — rjr freestream velocity = V0 y c n e i c i f f e l a m r e h T Ideal constant pressure cycle T.E.T.>>>

<<<We define engine transfer efficiency as: kinetic energy available from the core 1 kinetic energy at the propelling nozzle Kinetic energy available from core is given by and kinetic energy available at the propelling nozzle by y(K?-tf) Hence the engine transfer efficiency is: Now consider the overall energy transfer.>>>

<<<Energy in the bypass stream is given by: These must be equal.>>>
<<<Therefore and so and Substituting (VЈ — V0 2) in the equation of rjT: As stated earlier, rjT is a function of the turbine and compressor efficiencies.>>>

<<<9.25 Influence of component efficiency on cycle pressure ratio (source ref.>>>
<<<3).>>>
<<<Overall pressure ratio The influence of component efficiency Increasing component efficiency levels has three basic effects.>>>
<<<• Thermal efficiency is improved by the direct effect of the improved component efficiencies.>>>
<<<• The optimum pressure ratio increases as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<9.25.>>>
<<<The higher pressure ratio in turn improves the thermal efficiency.>>>
<<<• The best match of turbine entry temperature and pressure ratio changes.>>>
<<<However, higher pressure ratio will result in higher cooling air temperatures from the compressor and therefore more cooling air will be required, unless improved turbine materials or much better cooling techniques are employed.>>>
<<<It is possible that in the absence of such improvements the increased cooling air requirement could negate the advantage of the higher pressure ratio.>>>
<<<Figure 9.26 shows the effect of high temperature material technology and improved cooling techniques on the thermal efficiency.>>>
<<<Constant core energy is assumed; therefore as turbine entry temperature is increased and/or the cooling airflow reduced the gas generator air mass flow can be reduced.>>>
<<<Propulsive efficiency Propulsive efficiency (rjp) is defined as: work done on aircraft work done on aircraft 4- kinetic energy imparted to jet  No cooling air, ceramics etc.>>>

<<<3).>>>
<<<Work done on the aircraft is the engine nett thrust multiplied by the aircraft speed.>>>
<<<As shown earlier the nett thrust is evaluated as: M(Vj - F0) Then the work done on the aircraft is V0[M(Vi ~ Vo)] The kinetic energy imparted to the jet (defined as the work wasted in the exhaust) can be expressed as: Propulsive efficiency (rjp) then becomes: where: rjp = propulsive efficiency V0 = flight speed Vj = jet velocity  For a given flight speed the jet velocity will determine the propulsive efficiency.>>>
<<<The choice of jet velocity will determine the mechanical configuration of the engine from the high jet velocity of a pure jet engine to the modest jet velocity of a turbofan engine and ultimately to the low jet velocity of propeller engines.>>>
<<<In other words, as bypass ratio increases the jet velocity drops and the propulsive efficiency increases.>>>
<<<However, as shown earlier the nett thrust (Xn) is a function of jet velocity: Zn = Mty ~ *i) where: M = airflow mass flow Vj = jet velocity V0 = aircraft velocity Therefore, substituting this definition of V1 into the equation for rjp gives: and V+1* Aircraft flight Mach number (Mn) = V0/a where a is the speed of sound at the % = x ambient temperature.>>>
<<<Then 2Mn - a I* = x - 7 + 2Mn.a M If we assume flight above the tropopause where the ambient temperature is constant (at this height the speed of sound is 295 m/s in ISA conditions [see Data D]).>>>
<<<For simplicity, assume that the engine hot and cold jet stream velocities are equal; then the equation above gives: 590Mw % = x - ^ + 59OMn M where: Xn = nett thrust in Newtons M = engine mass flow in kg/sec The above expression is sometimes quoted in imperial units in which thrust is in pounds, mass flow in lb/sec, velocity in ft/sec.>>>
<<<Replacing M in the above formula with W/g gives: 2Mn • a where: Xn/ W = specific thrust In the tropopause, a = 968 ft/sec and g = 32.2ft/sec2, giving: and where thrust Xn is in pounds force and 'mass' flow M is in Ib/sec.>>>
<<<Comments As mentioned earlier, in this chapter a simplified approach has been adopted to more easily illustrate the underlying principles.>>>
<<<For example, the turbofan engines have been treated as having a single stream with average jet velocities and pressures whereas in reality the bypass and the gas generator flow must be treated separately.>>>
<<<No distinction has been made between the fully cowled engine with a single nozzle with mixed exhaust flows and the separate jets of the three-quarter cowled engine.>>>
<<<Component efficiencies have been mentioned but no attempt has been made to quantify them or to demonstrate the matching of turbines to compressors or how to choose the working point on the compressors to give an acceptable surge margin.>>>
<<<Disregarding the simplifying assumptions mentioned above you should now have an underlying appreciation of the matching of engine performance with aircraft requirements and be able to make reasonable choices in the initial design stages.>>>
<<<To gain more understanding of the subject there are many textbooks on gas turbine theory and design6'7 which deal with engine detail design in much more depth than is appropriate here.>>>

<<<The flight profile may be split in to several phases as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<A typical set of allowances and reserves is shown in Table 10.1.>>>
<<<Performance calculations The performance calculations for each phase of the flight and their impact on the aircraft range are described below.>>>

<<<The fuel required is defined as minutes of fuel burn at maximum take-off rating, with a typical time of two minutes.>>>
<<<Takeoff distance The distances available at an airfield are given in the following form.>>>
<<<• Take-off run available - this is the length of the paved runway.>>>
<<<• Emergency distance available - this is the sum of the runway length plus stopway length.>>>
<<<The stopway is an area at the end of the runway, which is clear of obstructions.>>>
<<<• Take-off distance available - this is the sum of the runway, stopway and clearway lengths.>>>
<<<The clearway distance is the distance from the end of the stopway to the first obstruction with a height of 35 ft or more.>>>
<<<These distances are shown diagrammatically in Fig.>>>
<<<10.2.>>>
<<<Take-off distances required by the aircraft are related to aircraft performance.>>>
<<<• Take-off run required - this is the distance from the start of the take-off run to the point of lift-off, plus one third of the airborne distance from lift-off to 35 ft [10.7 m] (known as the screen height).>>>

<<<The two definitions for engine-out calculations are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.3. in the take-off configuration the aircraft stall speed Takeoff performance - all engines operating The take-off performance of the aircraft with all engines operating is relatively straightforward.>>>
<<<The aircraft, starting at rest, accelerates along the runway at a low angle of attack altitude (nose-wheel on the ground) and passes a speed (Vs) which equals (e.g.>>>
<<<undercarriage down and flaps deflected to the take-off angle).>>>
<<<At a speed (VR) which is greater than Vs, the pilot rotates the aircraft by lifting the nose-wheel off the ground.>>>
<<<During this manoeuvre the aircraft angle of attack may be limited to avoid the rear fuselage touching the runway.>>>
<<<The aircraft will continue to move along the runway until the speed increases to the lift-off value (VLOF).>>>
<<<At this point the aircraft starts to climb away from the runway slowly gaining height until the screen height specified in the requirements (usually 35 ft; 10.7 m) is achieved.>>>
<<<At this point the aircraft speed should be equal to or greater than speed V2 (see definition below).>>>
<<<Speed V2 is obviously a critical parameter in the estimation of take-off performance.>>>
<<<The airworthiness requirements prescribe various criteria that have to be met in determining V2.>>>
<<<The speeds defined for take-off calculations are illustrated and described in Fig.>>>

<<<Transition to climb.>>>
<<<During transition the aircraft accelerates from V^OҐ to the take-off climb speed V2.>>>
<<<It is difficult to accurately predict the ground distance covered during transition.>>>
<<<A simple method will be presented, but where possible it should be calibrated against the measured performance of current aircraft.>>>
<<<During transition we assume that the aircraft flies at 0.9CLmax and that the average speed in the manoeuvre is given by: We also assume that the aircraft is flying along an arc, as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<Estimation of takeoff distance - with one engine failed As described previously, the pilot has two options in the event of an engine failure during the take-off run: • continue the take-off and fly away on the remaining engines; • apply emergency braking and bring the aircraft to rest further down the runway.>>>
<<<These two options were shown on Fig.>>>
<<<10.3.>>>
<<<They are often referred to as 'accelerate-go' and 'accelerate-stop'.>>>
<<<If the engine failure occurs early in the take- off run it would be preferable to stop the aircraft.>>>
<<<If the failure was later (when the aircraft had achieved a large amount of kinetic energy) it may be better to continue the take-off and fly away.>>>
<<<For a given aircraft weight it is possible to calculate the total distance required to either stop or fly (to the obstacle height) for a range of speeds at which the engine fails.>>>
<<<These calculations enable the failure speed at which the 'accelerate-go' distance is equal to the 'accelerate-stop' distance to be identified.>>>

<<<Balanced field length is a function of aircraft weight; therefore it is possible to operate an aircraft out of an airport with restricted runway length by reducing aircraft weight (removing payload and/or fuel).>>>

<<<If the aircraft is take-off climb critical it would be appropriate to use a more detailed method as described in Chapter 8.>>>
<<<The engines will be at maximum take-off power setting.>>>
<<<However, the thrust produced will be lower than the sea-level static value due to the effect of forward speed.>>>

<<<En-route performance In normal flight the aircraft can be flying in any of the following conditions: • constant altitude, constant speed • climbing or descending at constant speed • accelerating or decelerating at constant altitude • climbing or descending and accelerating or decelerating Figure 10.11 shows the forces diagram and the velocity acceleration diagram for the general case with a climb gradient y.>>>
<<<Assuming small angles: Since Therefore T = D+ W(dV/dt) + Wsiny siny = (dh/dt)/V T = D + W(dV/dt) + W(dh/dt)/V V(T - D)IW = V(dV/dt) + (dh/dt) (10.15) The thrust available (T) has to overcome the drag (D) and at the same time provide the necessary acceleration (dV/dt) and/or rate of climb (dh/dt).>>>
<<<Climb from 1500 ft to initial cruise altitude This is split into two parts: 1.>>>
<<<1500 ft to 10000 ft where the speed is restricted to 250 kt in the USA (but not necessarily in the rest of the world); 2. from 10 000 ft to the initial cruise altitude.>>>
<<<The distance flown in both of these phases contributes to the range.>>>
<<<The climb speed above 10000 ft is at constant EAS followed by a constant Mach number.>>>
<<<Various criteria can be applied to determine these climb speeds.>>>
<<<The two most common are: • speed for minimum time to height • speed for minimum direct operating cost.>>>
<<<In normal operation the second of these two options is used.>>>
<<<The speed is higher than that required for minimum time to height.>>>
<<<This reduces the block time, improves the productivity and hence improves the direct operating cost (DOC).>>>
<<<The Mach number at the top of climb in these circumstances is usually the cruise Mach number.>>>
<<<Climbing at constant equivalent airspeed (EAS) implies an increasing true airspeed as altitude increases.>>>
<<<Climbing at constant Mach number below the tropopause implies a reduction in the true air speed as altitude increases.>>>
<<<Hence when calculating climb performance these effects need to be taken into account.>>>
<<<From equation (10.15) the rate of climb with no acceleration is given by: and the rate of climb with acceleration by (RoC)0 = [(T-D)/W]V (RoC\ = [T-D- (W/g)(AV/At)](V/W) = [(T - D)/W]V - (V/g)(AV/Ai) (10.16) Now (AV/At)/(Ah/At) = (AV/Ah) Dividing equation (10.16) by (Ah/At) and substituting for (RoC)0 we get: (RoC\ = (RoC)0Z[I + (V/g)(AV/Ah)} The climb can now be computed using a step by step procedure using the appropriate engine climb rating as specified by the engine manufacturer.>>>
<<<Cruise performance An aircraft in cruise is neither accelerating or climbing.>>>
<<<It will normally be flying at a constant speed (Mach number or EAS) at a constant altitude.>>>
<<<An examination of equation (10.15) for the cruise case shows that with zero acceleration and zero rate of climb, thrust equals drag (as would be expected).>>>
<<<Before looking at cruise performance and its implication on range the aircraft must be capable of climbing to the desired initial cruise altitude in an acceptable time.>>>
<<<This requires a reasonable rate of climb at the initial cruise altitude.>>>
<<<The initial cruise altitude will often define the climb thrust required and the aircraft wing area, as discussed below.>>>
<<<At the initial cruise altitude a rate of climb of 300ft/min is normally required.>>>
<<<Therefore the thrust available at this height must equal the aircraft drag plus the thrust to produce the required climb rate.>>>
<<<The climb gradient from equation (10.14) may be written as: y=VJV = (T-D)/W Vc is the rate of climb (300ft/min= 1.52m/s) and V is the aircraft speed at the initial cruise altitude (i.e.>>>
<<<the aircraft cruise speed).>>>
<<<The drag (D) may be estimated using the methods outlined in Chapter 8.>>>
<<<Thus rearranging the required increase in thrust to give Vc ft/min rate of climb: AT = (VJV)W Total thrust required now becomes: T = (VJV)W + D Note that the thrust calculated above is at a climb rating and must be related back to an equivalent static sea-level take-off thrust to determine the installed thrust required for the aircraft design.>>>
<<<The aircraft at the initial cruise condition should be operating at a lift coefficient to give a lift/drag ratio near the maximum.>>>
<<<If the lift coefficient is too high it implies that the wing area is too small or conversely if it is too low the wing is too large.>>>
<<<In the cruise phase the range flown is calculated using the appropriate aircraft and engine parameters along with the fuel available for cruise.>>>
<<<Assume that the total aircraft thrust at cruise rating is T9 and that at this condition the engine has a specific fuel consumption (SFC) denoted by c [measured in (N/sN)].>>>
<<<The decrease in aircraft weight with time due to fuel burn is: (dW/dt) = -c-T For straight and level flight, we have (T = D) and (L = W), therefore: (dW/dt) = -cD(W/L) and dt = (l/c)(L/D)(dW/W) (10.17) Integrating between an initial cruise weight W1 and the final cruise weight W2 gives: I = (IfC)(LfD)In(W1ZW2) If the aircraft is flying at a speed V then the range flown is: R = (I2- tx)V In(WJW2) (10.18) (10.19) This is the classical Breguet Range Equation.>>>
<<<The equation assumes the lift to drag ratio (LfD) remains constant throughout the cruise phase.>>>
<<<This implies that the aircraft is constantly climbing to maintain the same lift coefficient but this height change is very gradual and can be ignored in initial project calculations.>>>
<<<In practice, air traffic control does not allow cruise-climb profiles and insists on airlines adopting a stepped climb procedure as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.12.>>>
<<<Currently the steps must be 4000 ft, but with the introduction of satellite navigation this may be reduced to 2000 ft.>>>
<<<The maximum cruise range for a given speed can be derived as follows.>>>
<<<The range covered in time dt is given by: where VT = cruise speed dR= VTdt Noting that Fx = [2W/pSCL]05 and recalling equation (10.17) for (dt) gives: 1000ft = 5% thrust Buffet boundary 300 ft/min.>>>

<<<Option 1.>>>
<<<The fuel burn can be obtained by applying equations (10.20), (10.21) and (10.22) over a range of altitude.>>>
<<<Option 2.>>>
<<<This is usually flown at the aircraft design Mach number and at an altitude to maximise the range with the given fuel load.>>>
<<<The speed in this case is usually higher than for case 1 in order to reduce block time thereby increasing the aircraft productivity and hence minimising direct operating cost.>>>
<<<Option 3.>>>
<<<Is applicable to the holding/diversion conditions.>>>
<<<Equation (10.17) shows that the endurance is a function of the engine specific fuel consumption (c) and the aircraft lift drag ratio (L/D).>>>
<<<As the holding altitude is usually specified, to minimise the holding fuel the aircraft needs to be flown at the highest L/D possible (i.e.>>>
<<<as close to the minimum drag speed as is practical to give acceptable aircraft speed stability).>>>
<<<Descent performance The descent calculation is similar to the climb except that in this case the thrust is less than the drag.>>>
<<<R a t e o f d e s c e n t = [(D - T)/W\ -V-(l + V/g.>>>
<<<dV/dh)~l The descent speeds are usually Mmo and Vmo down to 10000 ft and 250 kt below 10000 ft.>>>
<<<The thrust is at a setting which enables the cabin air conditioning to be maintained.>>>
<<<There is one other criterion that must be observed: the rate of descent must be such that the maximum rate of change of pressure in the cabin does not exceed 300ft/min.>>>
<<<Once these conditions are met the descent fuel, distance and time can be calculated on a step by step basis similar to the climb.>>>
<<<At the initial project stage in aircraft design there are usually insufficient data to establish the thrust setting; it is therefore acceptable to extend the cruise to the destination and ignore the descent manoeuvre.>>>
<<<This is a pessimistic assumption as the air miles/kg of fuel is much higher in the descent than in the cruise.>>>
<<<Often a first approximation of the thrust and fuel flow on the descent is possible and can be used to give an allowance for the time, distance and fuel used in the descent.>>>
<<<Landing The landing distance is predicted in a similar manner to take-off.>>>
<<<The landing phase is split into several segments as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.13.>>>
<<<The distance covered during each segment is calculated and then summed to obtain the total distance.>>>
<<<This value is then factored to account for pilot and operational uncertainties.>>>
<<<Each of the separate phases will now be described: 1.>>>
<<<Approach.>>>
<<<For civil transport aircraft the approach flight path is typically made at 3° to the horizontal.>>>
<<<For FAR and JAR certification the approach starts at a screen height of 50 ft and ends at the flare height, hҐ.>>>
<<<The value of hҐ is given by: ^F = r • yA • yA/2 where yA is the approach gradient.>>>

<<<Flare.>>>
<<<During the flare manoeuvre, the aircraft decelerates from the approach speed (VA), to the touch-down speed (VTD).>>>
<<<The average speed during the flare, VF, is given by: Typically FTD = 1.15 Fs.>>>
<<<The radius of the flare manoeuvre, r, is given by: VF = (VA + Vn,)/!>>>
<<<Typically n — 1.2.>>>
<<<The ground distance covered during the flare, sF, is given by: r=ViMn-l)] sF = r - y A (10.24) 3.>>>
<<<Ground roll.>>>
<<<After touch-down the aircraft will roll for a few seconds before the pilot applies the brakes and spoilers.>>>
<<<The distance covered is called the free-roll distance.>>>
<<<This may be approximated using: SFR = t - Vn, where t is duration of free roll.>>>
<<<The braking distance (sB) is calculated using the following equation with speed from VTD to rest: 5B = [\/(2gKA)] In [(KT + KxVn,)/KT] (10.25) where: KA = ~(pa)(2W/S) K7 =-Ii and in general thrust = zero.>>>
<<<The thrust and lift coefficient must be evaluated at the average energy speed (i.e.>>>
<<<0.707 Vjn).>>>
<<<Typically thrust will be zero or idle and with spoilers deployed CL will be zero.>>>
<<<The effects of braking are included by modifying the value of \x.>>>
<<<Maximum values under various conditions are shown below: dry paved runway wet paved runway icy paved runway jn = 0.5 \i = 0.3 \i = 0.1 Many modern civil jet transports use coefficients less than 0.5 in normal operating conditions to reduce brake and tyre wear.>>>
<<<The maximum coefficient is dependent on wheel size which is limited in order to fit the brake discs and systems.>>>
<<<Note that there is weight transfer during braking on to the nose undercarriage.>>>
<<<A typical value of \i would be 0.3.>>>
<<<The total landing distance calculated by the equations above is factored by 1.66 for JAR/FAR certification rules to account for variability in pilot and operational uncertainties during the landing manoeuvre.>>>
<<<Simplified empirical landing calculations If we examine the above equations we note that: • the approach distance is independent of the aircraft speed and is only a function of the approach angle; • the flare distance is a function of V2 and the normal acceleration; • the ground roll is a function of V2 and the available braking force.>>>
<<<The total landing distance is primarily a function of V2, the normal acceleration in the flare and the braking force.>>>
<<<The normal acceleration in the flare must lie in a small band for passenger comfort.>>>
<<<The braking force is a function of the braking coefficient of friction on the runway surface and the amount of aircraft mass reacted by the braked wheels.>>>
<<<This later item depends upon the mass distribution between the nose-wheels and the main undercarriage when in the braking mode and also the amount of residual lift from the wings.>>>
<<<The residual lift from the wings depends upon how efficient the lift spoilers are and how quickly they are deployed after touch-down (the effect of thrust reversers is not allowed).>>>
<<<If we assume that all aircraft pull a similar amount of 'g' in the flare, the mass distribution between nose and main wheels is similar and the spoilers have roughly the same efficiency; then the landing performance is purely a function of the approach speed, VA, squared.>>>
<<<Airworthiness requirements specify that VA = 1.3 Vs where Vs is the stalling speed in the landing configuration.>>>
<<<Vi = constant x M/(SW • C ^ • o) landing distance (approx.)>>>
<<<= M/(SW • C ^ x • o) (10.26) An analysis of the landing performance of current aircraft will enable this relationship to be calibrated.>>>
<<<One might expect more scatter for landing distance than take-off as the major decelerating force from the wheel brakes is subject to more variability than the accelerating force from the engines during take-off.>>>
<<<Fuel for approach and landing This phase of the flight does not contribute to the range but it does affect the fuel burn and hence the fuel available for the other flight segments.>>>
<<<The customer will usually define the fuel required for this phase in terms of minutes at the approach fuel flow.>>>
<<<A typical time would be six minutes.>>>
<<<Taxi-in after landing Again this does not contribute to the range but it does impact on the total fuel burn.>>>
<<<The fuel allowance for this item would come out of the reserves.>>>
<<<A typical time would be six minutes at the taxi fuel flow.>>>
<<<Reserves This is extra fuel that has to be carried to cater for unforeseen events (e.g.>>>
<<<air traffic control may prevent the aircraft flying at its optimum altitude, head-winds may be more severe than forecast, thunderstorms may force the aircraft to depart from the planned flight plan, the destination airfield may have a traffic problem and the aircraft may have to join a holding pattern, the destination airfield may be closed for weather or other operational reasons and the aircraft may have to divert).>>>
<<<It is necessary to consider the worst case scenario, with the defined hold and diversion requirements.>>>
<<<The fuel allowed for the overshoot at the end of the normal operational mission is typically 1-1.5 min at take-off power.>>>
<<<The fuel for hold is calculated at the speed and fuel flow for maximum endurance.>>>
<<<The diversion fuel is calculated using climb, cruise and descent techniques to give the minimum fuel for the required diversion distance.>>>
<<<Payload range The aircraft mission analysis enables the fuel required for various range and take-off weights to be calculated and a payload-range diagram to be constructed.>>>
<<<This shows the ability of the aircraft to perform different missions.>>>
<<<A typical payload-range diagram is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.14.>>>
<<<A full explanation of the diagram is given in Chapter 7.>>>
<<<Three points define the payload-range diagram.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Range with maximum payload This point is defined as the range flown with maximum payload.>>>
<<<The maximum payload of aircraft is defined as either the maximum volumetric payload or the maximum zero fuel weight limited payload.>>>
<<<• The maximum volumetric payload includes: 1. mass of passengers in high-density layout, assuming standard passenger weights; 2. mass of passengers baggage, assuming standard baggage weights; 3. remaining hold volume used for cargo, assuming standard cargo densities.>>>
<<<Maximum payload Maximum take-off weight l d a o y a P Maximum fuel capacity Fig.>>>
<<<10.14 Payload-range diagram.>>>
<<<Range (nm) • The maximum zero fuel mass limited payload is: zero fuel mass limited payload = maximum zero fuel mass — operating mass empty The maximum zero fuel weight is normally based on structural requirements.>>>
<<<In the absence of any other criteria at the conceptual stage it is acceptable to assume that the maximum zero fuel weight is equal to the operating weight empty plus the maximum volumetric payload.>>>
<<<2.>>>
<<<Maximum fuel range This point is defined as the range flown with maximum fuel and the associated payload to maintain the aircraft maximum take-off weight.>>>
<<<The maximum fuel weight corresponds to the fuel tank volume available.>>>
<<<Most civil transport aircraft store fuel in the wing.>>>
<<<Additional fuel for long-range aircraft may be stored in the wing centre section and in some exceptional cases also in the tail structures.>>>
<<<The payload with maximum fuel is then calculated as: payload = maximum take-off mass — maximum fuel mass — operating mass empty 3.>>>
<<<Ferry range This point corresponds to the range flown with maximum fuel and zero payload.>>>
<<<Thus, in this case the aircraft is no longer at its maximum take-off weight and the aircraft cruise lift to drag ratio (L/D) will be different from that in cases 1 and 2.>>>
<<<The take-off weight for the segment is calculated as: take-off weight = operating weight empty + maximum fuel weight The aircraft specification will define the design range and corresponding design payload.>>>
<<<The design payload on a civil airliner is usually less than the maximum payload.>>>
<<<It normally consists of the maximum passenger load plus their baggage and in addition some airlines require a certain amount of cargo.>>>
<<<This will usually place the aircraft design point on the payload-range diagram between cases 1 and 2.>>>
<<<Example calculations for performance estimation The performance of an aircraft can now be calculated.>>>

<<<Due regard needs to be taken of the thrust fall off with speed when sizing the engine.>>>
<<<It can be seen from Fig.>>>
<<<10.10 that the choice of flap angle, i.e.>>>
<<<C1^3x, effects the thrust requirements for both field length and climb-out.>>>
<<<Increasing the aircraft C1^13X reduces the thrust requirement for a given field length but increases thrust required for climb-out.>>>
<<<The choice of flap and flap angle is therefore important.>>>
<<<The critical climb-out requirement is usually in the second segment.>>>
<<<In this phase the aircraft has take-off flap deployed, g a r d / t f i L Fig.>>>

<<<6W undercarriage up, one engine failed and the remaining engines at take-off power.>>>
<<<For a twin-engined aircraft (reference Table 10.2) in the second segment: (T/W) = 0.024 + [1/(LfD)] Obstacle clearance There is one issue which can affect the aircraft take-off thrust requirement, and that is obstacle clearance.>>>
<<<Many of the major airfields have runways with obstacles which affect the ability of some aircraft to take full advantage of the runway length available.>>>
<<<Gatwick is a typical example; on one of the runway directions there is 10500 ft available but due to an obstacle in the flight path the effective runway available is reduced to approximately 10000 ft.>>>
<<<The aircraft nett flight path with one engine inoperative must clear any obstacle by at least 35 ft.>>>
<<<The nett flight path is the gross flight path reduced by the following gradients: two-engined aircraft 0.8% three-engined aircraft 0.9% 1.0% four-engined aircraft More details of this requirement can be found in CAP395 - Air Navigation: The Order and the Regulations Section 3 General Regulations.>>>
<<<It is difficult to deal with this type of requirement at the project stage as we do not usually design the aircraft for one specific operation.>>>
<<<Obstacle clearance is best allowed for by examining the effect of the obstacle on existing aircraft performance and deciding on an effective runway length to clear the obstacle.>>>
<<<En-route climb performance There are two issues here that effect the engine: the initial cruise altitude capability and the time taken to arrive at this altitude.>>>
<<<Initial cruise altitude capability This definition is the condition of the aircraft at the top of climb.>>>
<<<By the time the aircraft arrives at this point it has lost about 2-3% of its take-off weight because of the fuel used.>>>
<<<Initial cruise altitude capability is defined as the ability to sustain a certain rate of climb at this altitude, at typical cruise speed and with the engines operating at maximum climb rating.>>>
<<<A 300ft/min rate of climb is the usual requirement although airlines may specify other levels (e.g.>>>
<<<500ft/min).>>>
<<<In this calculation we will assume a 300ft/min requirement.>>>
<<<The initial cruise altitude is set at a minimum of 2000 ft above the optimum cruise altitude.>>>
<<<This margin is required because in the current air traffic control environment it is not possible to follow the optimum cruise altitude schedule (i.e.>>>
<<<approximately a constant CL technique).>>>
<<<Such a procedure would lead to a gradual increase in altitude as fuel is burnt and the aircraft becomes lighter.>>>
<<<Air traffic control requires aircraft travelling in the same direction to fly at discrete flight levels separated by 4000 ft in altitude.>>>
<<<This means that a minimum of 2000 ft margin above the optimum is required to enable the aircraft to fly a stepped cruise technique.>>>
<<<This is shown on Fig.>>>
<<<10.30.>>>
<<<Development in navigational aids may enable this separation to be reduced to 2000 ft in the near future.>>>

<<<Aircraft mass Thrust required for 300ft/min rate of climb: where: VTAS = true airspeed (kt) AXn = additional thrust (Ib) Total thrust required Time to height The initial cruise altitude capability will fix the thrust level at the top of climb, but the time to height will also be affected by the thrust ratings at the lower altitudes.>>>
<<<This can be an important issue from operational considerations.>>>
<<<The ability to climb to altitude quickly may enable the aircraft to take advantage of an air traffic control slot which would be missed by an aircraft with a low climb capability.>>>
<<<Such aircraft with limited performance may therefore be subject to delay or be forced to cruise at a lower than optimum altitude.>>>
<<<An acceptable climb time can be the subject of some debate but on a long-range aircraft such as the B747-400 is often considered as a typical design criterion.>>>
<<<This aircraft climbs to 31000 ft in about 20min at MTOM.>>>
<<<Typical climb performance is shown in Fig.>>>

<<<Fig.>>>
<<<10.32 Estimated ratio of cruise to climb thrust.>>>
<<<Cruise performance Cruise thrust required is around 7-8% less than the climb thrust.>>>
<<<As shown in the calculation above climb thrust may be fixed by a rate of climb of 300ft/min at cruise Mach number and altitude whereas cruise thrust is fixed by a rate of climb of lOOft/min.>>>
<<<Figure 10.32 shows how the ratio of cruise to climb thrust varies with cruise lift/drag ratio and the cruise Mach number.>>>
<<<En-route engine-out ceilings These requirements can determine the maximum continuous rating for the engine.>>>
<<<The regulations say that in the event of an en-route engine failure all terrain must be cleared by a minimum of 2000 ft with a gradient which varies with the number of engines.>>>
<<<This means, for example, over the Rocky Mountains an engine-out ceiling of 16000 ft is desirable, a lower ceiling than this may result in the aircraft having to fly a non-optimum (less direct) route leading to increased fuel requirements.>>>
<<<The aircraft specification should allow for these considerations, if known at the project stage, and set a ceiling appropriate to the envisaged use of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The gradients specified by airworthiness requirements for the engine-out ceilings are associated with the number of engines on the aircraft configuration: number of engines gradient % 2 1.1 3 1.4 4 1.6 The effect of en-route gradient requirements can be alleviated by using a drift down technique as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.33.>>>
<<<However, for this purpose no advantage can be taken of any cruise altitude above the engine re-light altitude.>>>
<<<Cruise altitude Relight altitude Aircraft flight path Engine-out ceiling Gradient = 1.1 to 1.6% Terrain Fig.>>>
<<<10.33 En-route requirement with one engine failed.>>>
<<<Descent The descent is governed by the rule that the rate of descent in the cabin should not exceed 300ft/min and the requirements of the air conditioning system.>>>
<<<Hence the idle setting on the descent will be set by the requirements to supply the appropriate amount of air at the right pressure to the air conditioning system.>>>
<<<The relationship between aircraft altitude and cabin altitude for a typical pressure differential of 8 psi is shown on Fig.>>>

<<<10.35).>>>
<<<The reason for this variation lies in the change of lift to drag ratio with aircraft mass, as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<10.36.>>>
<<<Landing performance There are two requirements in landing which affect the engine in terms of thrust: • approach climb • baulked landing climb These requirements are not usually critical and need only be examined on short- range aircraft where the maximum landing weight is either the same as or close to the maximum, take-off weight.>>>
<<<Approach climb With the aircraft in the approach condition, with approach flap, undercarriage retracted, maximum landing weight with one engine inoperative and the remaining engines at take-off power the gradients required by the airworthiness regulations vary with the number of engines in the aircraft configuration as follows: number of engines gradient % 2 2.1 3 2.4 4 2.7 The aircraft speed should not exceed 1.5 x stall speed in the approach condition and the stall speed in the approach condition should not exceed 1.1 x the stall speed for the all-engines operating case with landing flap.>>>
<<<Baulked landing climb With the aircraft in the landing configuration, with all engines operating at a thrust level which is available eight seconds after initiation of movement of the throttle, a gradient of 3.2% is required to meet airworthiness regulations.>>>

<<<An indication is given on how to establish a starting point and then how to proceed to establish a preliminary aircraft design.>>>
<<<The method also enables the critical requirements to be established and shows the effect of alleviating any that might have an undesirably large influence on the design.>>>
<<<A specimen calculation is included at the end of this section.>>>
<<<On completing this section you should be able to tackle the full design process including iterative and parametric studies.>>>
<<<The aircraft design case studies that follow Chapter 15 further expand the methods shown here.>>>
<<<The values and relationships used and further developed for a particular study may only be appropriate for that study.>>>
<<<It is risky to use such values in other work without conducting a thorough validation of the data.>>>
<<<Introduction The aircraft specification lists the aircraft requirements in terms of payload, range and performance (en-route and field).>>>
<<<The design process involves selecting an aircraft layout and size to meet these requirements against some overall criteria such as minimum take-off weight or minimum direct operating cost (DOC) so that a baseline configuration can be established.>>>
<<<Apart from information and data for the aircraft, engine data including performance, weight and costs will also be required.>>>
<<<To assist in the early stages some typical engine data is given in Chapter 9 (Figs 9.18-9.21).>>>
<<<This data is in a non-dimensional form to make it easier to scale engine size in the initial design studies.>>>
<<<The only part of the aircraft that the specification immediately sizes, once the passenger comfort standard has been decided, is the fuselage.>>>
<<<There are therefore three major unknown aircraft parameters: wing area S engine thrust T take-off weight W All three of these parameters are interdependent.>>>
<<<The wing area affects the engine size and both of these impact on the empty weight, fuel weight and hence the maximum take-off weight.>>>
<<<Our analysis needs to take into account variations of these three major parameters.>>>
<<<It is necessary before starting the analysis to establish approximate values for each of these three parameters.>>>
<<<This is done by assessing the characteristics of current aircraft and engines with similar specification.>>>
<<<It is also useful to determine some simple weight and performance relationships for these aircraft.>>>
<<<This will enable an appropriate range of values of wing area and engine size to be selected and allow an approximation of the take-off weight to be made for the initial estimates.>>>
<<<The basic wing geometric characteristics (thickness chord and sweepback) will be dictated by the specified cruise Mach number and can therefore be fixed at an early stage.>>>
<<<The interdependence of wing area, engine thrust and take-off weight makes it impossible to consider them as independent variables.>>>
<<<However, an assessment can be made of wing loading (W/S) and thrust loading (T/W) using the performance equations from Chapter 10.>>>
<<<The simplified mass equations from Chapter 7 allow for each of the unknowns to be estimated.>>>
<<<Guidance on the input required for the performance and mass equations can be obtained from the characteristics of existing aircraft with a similar specification.>>>
<<<Typical values for these characteristics are given in the aircraft data files.>>>
<<<Care must be taken to ensure that the effect of any new technology under consideration for the design (e.g.>>>
<<<carbon fibre structure and laminar flow) is taken into account.>>>
<<<Wing loading Aircraft wing loading is usually determined by either the landing field length or the approach speed depending upon which of these is specified.>>>
<<<For a range of current aircraft the distance from 50 ft is plotted in Fig.>>>
<<<11.1 as a function of: (W/S)/(C^-o) where: o = p/p0 p = air density To comply with airworthiness requirements, the estimated distance from 50 ft is factored by the ratio (1.0/0.6) to obtain landing field length.>>>
<<<Care must be taken when using published figures to ascertain if the value is for the factored or actual distance.>>>
<<<To use the data on Fig.>>>
<<<11.1 requires the assessment of a C1^x in the landing configuration.>>>
<<<An assumption based on the wing thickness/chord ratio and sweepback required for the specification along with current aircraft data should give a reasonable estimate at this stage.>>>
<<<For turbofan-powered aircraft cruising at ) t f ( e c n a t s i d i g n d n a L Fig.>>>
<<<11.1 Landing distance from 50 ft. MO.75-0.85, CL1113X in the landing configuration would be expected to lie in the range 2.4 to 3.4.>>>
<<<If an approach speed is specified the wing loading can be obtained from the following equation: W/S = q-CL where: q = dynamic pressure = 0.5 p V2 V = aircraft speed CL = lift coefficient in the approach condition The flap setting for approach is not usually the same as used for landing.>>>
<<<The airworthiness regulations specify the approach speed as follows: broach < 1.5 x FstalI approach flap Ktaii approach flap > 1.1 x Fstall landing flap Approach > 1.3 Ktaii approach flap The approach speed must therefore lie between 1.43 and 1.65 T^tall, where T^tall is determined with landing flap.>>>
<<<Or in terms of C1^1x landing flap, the approach CL will lie between (C1^x/2.04) and (C1^x/2.72).>>>
<<<At some airports during busy times air traffic control sets the approach speed.>>>
<<<For some aircraft this means that landing flap is set and landing gear is down on approach.>>>
<<<In each of the above cases W/S will be that appropriate to the aircraft maximum landing weight.>>>
<<<This can be corrected to W/S at the maximum take-off weight by the ratio of maximum landing weight to maximum take-off weight.>>>
<<<This can be obtained from consideration of current aircraft with a similar specification.>>>
<<<An initial estimate of the wing loading has now been made.>>>
<<<Two further checks are required.>>>
<<<Firstly, that at the initial cruise altitude the aircraft is operating at a reasonable lift coefficient to give Mn(LfD) somewhere near the maximum, and secondly that the ride (response to gusts) is acceptable.>>>
<<<Cruise check The cruise Mach number and the initial cruise altitude are given in the specification.>>>
<<<The dynamic pressure (0.5pV2), denoted as q can then be computed: q = OJpMn2 (in British units) where: p = ambient pressure (lb/sqft) at the initial cruise altitude Mn = cruise Mach number The wing loading (W/S) at start of cruise is approximately (0.98 x WyS)take_off due to the use of fuel during taxi, take-off and climb.>>>
<<<Then cruise CL = 0.98 (W/S) • q'x This can be compared with CLdes obtained from Fig.>>>
<<<8.3.>>>
<<<A typical curve of lift to drag ratio versus CL at the cruise Mach number is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<11.2 which also shows the CLdes from Fig.>>>
<<<8.3.>>>
<<<It should be noted that the curve is flat around the maximum L/D value.>>>
<<<In the example shown 99% of the maximum L/D value covers the CL range from 0.43 to 0.50.>>>
<<<It is therefore not necessary to precisely match the CLdes value as the effect on aircraft performance of not operating at the maximum value is minimal.>>>

<<<11.3 Ride and speed limitations.>>>
<<<Ride check It is necessary to check whether the chosen wing characteristics and the loading will give a satisfactory gust response at the maximum cruise Mach number.>>>
<<<The ability of a given wing planform and wing loading to give a satisfactory gust response is assessed by referring to the boundary conditions of Fig.>>>
<<<11.3 where limiting speed is shown as a function of a wing gust response parameter.>>>
<<<Two boundary conditions are shown, one with active controls giving the aircraft a gust alleviation capability, and the other without active control.>>>
<<<The gust response parameter is defined by the equation: [xlwb-ARf(WfS)] where: alwb = wing body lift curve slope as calculated from the EDSU (Engineering Science Data Units) data sheets AR = aspect ratio (W/S) is the wing loading at the start of the cruise The wing aspect ratio is the term that makes allowance for aeroelastic effects.>>>
<<<The higher the aspect ratio the more flexible the wing will be.>>>
<<<On a swept wing, as the wing flexes, the ideal incidence will change, hence the local lift will change and this will affect the gust response.>>>
<<<Provided the wing loading (W/S) is greater than about 340kg/sq m (701b/sqft) this is not usually a critical item.>>>
<<<Engine size Engine size is usually determined by either the take-off performance or the climb performance at the initial cruise altitude.>>>
<<<The particular requirement which determines the engine size will be dictated by both engine and airframe characteristics.>>>
<<<As noted in Chapter 9 short-range aircraft do not require such a high cruise efficiency engine as long-range aircraft.>>>
<<<Engine bypass ratio and overall pressure ratio are the main parameters to affect engine efficiency.>>>
<<<However, high efficiency engines lose thrust with speed at a much higher rate than low efficiency engines.>>>
<<<Long-range aircraft usually have a fairly relaxed field requirement (lOOOOft+).>>>
<<<The engine for these aircraft will be sized for the top of climb requirement.>>>
<<<Conversely the short-range aircraft has a much more severe field length require- ment (5000-7000 ft).>>>
<<<With a lower bypass ratio and pressure ratio it would be expected that the engine would be sized at take-off.>>>
<<<These of course are generalisa- tions and there are engine airframe combinations which do not fit neatly into either of these categories.>>>
<<<If there is any doubt it is advisable to check both of these criteria to establish which is critical.>>>
<<<Takeoff The initial estimate for the take-off wing loading along with the specification field performance and equation (10.13) will enable an assessment of the thrust/weight ratio to be made as a function of the lift coefficient at V2.>>>
<<<The CLmax at take-off will lie between 1.7 and 2.2, and CLv will be between 1.18 and 1.53.>>>
<<<Statistical analysis of existing aircraft along with any proposed new technology will enable a first assessment of CLv2 to be made and hence an initial thrust/weight ratio.>>>
<<<As was noted earlier this thrust/weight ratio will be at 0.707 x V2 and hence needs correcting to static conditions: (thrust/weight)static = (thrust/weight)0707F2 • (static thrust/thrust0 707F2) Initial cruise altitude capability At the initial cruise altitude the aircraft will require a rate of climb of 300ft/min when flying at the cruise Mach number with engines set to maximum climb rating.>>>
<<<This enables the aircraft at the initial cruise altitude with engines at cruise thrust to have a margin over the maximum cruise thrust.>>>
<<<This margin is required to enable the flight control system to maintain height and speed under gusty conditions.>>>
<<<The equation for the thrust required at the top of climb (as shown in Chapter 10) can be rearranged to account for British units as follows: where: Mcl = mass at the top of climb (Ib) and is approximately 0.98 x MTOM Fn — climb thrust required at top of climb (Ib) (Fn needs to be referred back to the corresponding sea-level static value of thrust/weight ratio by using the engine characteristic which relates the maximum climb thrust take-off thrust.)>>>
<<<L/D = lift drag ratio at cruise speed V = cruise speed TAS (kt) (ir (FnTO/MTOM) = nclimb/Fnro) can be obtained from the engine data to the engine sea-level static (FJMJOM/iF^/F^) A first estimate of the cruise L/D is required.>>>
<<<A basis for this can be obtained from statistics of current aircraft and the wing geometric characteristics.>>>
<<<The L/D is primarily a function of the span loading, the aircraft profile drag and the wing loading.>>>
<<<Assuming a parabolic drag polar: As these aircraft will be operating at similar values of (Cf/e)0'5 and approximately the same relationship to (L/D)max, the cruise L/D will be a function of [b/(Sweitf5] or [AR/(SweJSwing)l The cruise lift/drag ratio based on estimates from the aircraft geometry plotted against an aspect ratio parameter, is shown in Fig.>>>

<<<In general the aircraft structure represents about 25-30% of the take-off mass.>>>

<<<Fuel mass Aircraft fuel mass has to allow for the design flight profile plus the specified reserves.>>>

<<<The method employed has been devised to show whether any of the initial requirements are dominant and the effect of relaxing such requirements.>>>
<<<It is based on the premise that the passenger capacity, cruise speed and the design range are fixed.>>>
<<<The passenger capacity and cruise speed are determined by the market requirements and the design range by the geography of the area in which the particular type of aircraft under consideration will be operating.>>>

<<<This will give nine aircraft designs at each wing area.>>>

<<<Now we know that: MTOM = Mpay + MOE + MF which can be rearranged to give: MTOM = Mpay [1 - (M0JMTOM) - (MF/MT0M)]~l Hence: MF/MT0M = 1 - (MJM2Y1 where: M1 = initial aircraft mass M2 = final aircraft mass From Fig.>>>
<<<11.8, the equivalent still-air range for a 6500 nm design range would be 7470 nm.>>>

<<<A cruise Mach number (Mn) of 0.85 gives a true air speed at 35 000 ft of 490 kt.>>>
<<<If we look at the engine data (Fig.>>>
<<<11.19), at M0.85: SFC/6 0.615 = 0.7 SFC = 0.59 (L/D) • (VISFC) = 20 • 490/0.59 = 16610 Note, the parameter above is referred to as the range parameter.>>>
<<<Substituting the above values into the range equation: R = (L/D) • (V/SFC)\oge(MJM2) gives: This equation gives: 7470 = 16 610 log e (MJM1) MF/MT0M = 0.362 A payload of 305 passengers at 95 kg each gives 28 975 kg or 63 879 Ib.>>>
<<<Hence take-off mass can be calculated as: MTOM = 63 879/(1 - 0.53 - 0.362) = 5914701b (268240 kg) Wing area is most likely to be determined by the approach speed at maximum landing mass (Mland).>>>
<<<On this type of aircraft (Mland/MTOM) = 0.72.>>>
<<<C ^ x (for approach speed= 1.3 K|tall)= 2.3.>>>
<<<CL approach = 2.3/1.32 = 1.36 Thus wing loading is: ^r at 145 kt = 71.41b/sqft.>>>
<<<Hence at landing: and at take-off: Hence wing area is given by: This calculation gives us the starting point for take-off weight and wing area.>>>
<<<What about thrust?>>>
<<<For this aircraft, top of climb may size the engine.>>>
<<<At this condition, Mn = 0.85, (L/D) = 20, altitude = 35 000 ft. For operational reasons we need a climb rate of 300 ft/min.>>>
<<<Weight at the top of climb is: 0.98 x MTOW = 0.98 x 591 470 = 580000 Ib Thrust required for zero rate of climb is: 580000(L//)) = 580000/20 = 29 000 Ib Fn/W for a 300 ft/min climb is given by: FJW = (Yc/V) = 300/(490 101.3) Note that 101.3 is the conversion of knots to ft/min.>>>
<<<Hence Hence total thrust required is: Fn = 3505 Ib 29 000+ 3505 = 32 505 Ib At 35 000 ft altitude the engine thrust lapse rate is 0.2.>>>
<<<There are two engines on the aircraft.>>>
<<<Therefore each engine will need 81 2601b (361 kN) of sea-level static thrust.>>>
<<<We now have some idea of the likely size of the aircraft and its engine.>>>
<<<MTOM Wing area Engine thrust [sea level static (SLS)] 591 500 Ib (268 249 kg) 4400 sq ft (398 m2) 81 3001b/eng (361.7kN) From the charts, the baseline engine has a thrust (SLS) of 81237 Ib (361 kN).>>>
<<<The above estimates enable a selection of wing area and engine scale to be made to start our design procedure.>>>

<<<A fuselage with two aisles was chosen with the following dimensions: fuselage diameter = 20.33 ft fuselage length = 206 ft Preliminary design procedure - results The drag and weight information can now be derived as shown (in Imperial units) in Fig.>>>

<<<The (profile + wave) drag data is shown at a lift coefficient of 0.5; in practice the drag will need to be adjusted for other lift coefficients.>>>

<<<However, other criteria can be used such as minimum fuel burn or minimum direct operating cost if or when these are thought to be more appropriate.>>>
<<<The preliminary design can now be compared with the original approximation (Table 11.1).>>>
<<<It is easy to examine changes to the performance or specification by reading data off the charts at the new values for the requirements and superimposing on the design chart.>>>
<<<Initially the choice of wing aspect ratio was based on current aircraft with a similar specification.>>>
<<<The only way to establish the validity of this original assumption is to repeat the analysis over a range of aspect ratios.>>>
<<<So far engine size and wing area have been considered to be variables; however, the aircraft designer is often presented with a fixed choice of engine.>>>
<<<In our example the engine scale is unity.>>>
<<<At this engine size the engine-out ceiling requirement is out of line with the other requirements.>>>
<<<This would suggest that the designer approach the engine company for an increase in maximum continuous power to bring the requirements more into line.>>>
<<<Alternatively the designer could approach those responsible for setting the aircraft specification, asking for a concession on the engine-out ceiling height.>>>
<<<In the case of a fixed sized engine a design chart similar to Fig.>>>
<<<11.29 could be produced using wing aspect ratio and wing area as the two variables.>>>
<<<Take-off mass has been used as the optimising criterion on the basis that there is a direct relationship between MTOM and aircraft price/operating cost.>>>
<<<Using the methods described in Chapter 12 and the aircraft design case studies, aircraft price or operating cost could be used instead of MTOM.>>>
<<<Aircraft cost estimations Objectives Aircraft design decisions have significant influence on the first cost and operating expenses of the aircraft.>>>
<<<It is therefore important to understand the cost implications of aircraft manufacture and operation and to take these into account when deciding the aircraft configuration and performance.>>>
<<<Consideration of cost aspects is especially significant in the preliminary design phase of aircraft projects as fundamental decisions are taken which will be influential in the overall cost of the project.>>>
<<<Such decisions affect the cost of manufacturing and equipping the basic aircraft and the subsequent cost of operating it over the route structure of an airline.>>>
<<<It is therefore essential to understand the cost estimation methods to be used by the customer when comparing competitive aircraft, in order to make sensible design choices.>>>
<<<This chapter introduces the methods by which aircraft operating costs are estimated.>>>
<<<These methods are used in the preliminary project phase to allow comparisons to be made between different aircraft configurations and to assess the best choice of values for all the aircraft parameters.>>>
<<<Indirect costs (those not directly related to the aircraft parameters, for example those associated with marketing and sales expenses) are only briefly covered, whereas direct costs are described in enough detail to allow estimating methods to be incorporated into the aircraft design process.>>>
<<<The principal cost functions are described and typical values given.>>>
<<<The chapter concludes with a specimen calculation and some reference data to be used in student project work.>>>
<<<After completing this chapter you should understand the main character- istics of cost estimation and be able to predict direct operating cost (DOC) on projected aircraft designs.>>>
<<<Introduction The main financial criterion on which the aircraft design should be judged is the return on investment (ROI) to the company.>>>

<<<12.1 Project cash flow 150 seat aircraft ($1995) (source AIAA-86-2667).>>>
<<<Years from start of project lies in the inherent variability in the nature of aircraft manufacture and operations and the associated substantial initial investment (i.e.>>>
<<<prior to the inflow of revenue from sales of aircraft).>>>
<<<The delay in recovering expenditure will result in negative cost flow in the early years of production.>>>
<<<During this time customers (airlines) make only a small payment to the manufacturers, to reserve a position in the aircraft production schedule; this is called an option.>>>
<<<From a project design study of a 150 seat regional aircraft conducted by McDonnell-Douglas (MD) some years ago, the cash flow history was forecast.>>>
<<<This is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<12.1 together with cash flow histories for a developed (stretched) existing civil aircraft and a military project.>>>
<<<The 'return' as measured in the ROI parameter will depend on the terms and conditions of the investment loans and not solely on the aircraft technical and operational performance.>>>
<<<Nevertheless, the overall financial balance sheet for the project must provide sufficient confidence to investors for the project to be externally financed.>>>
<<<The degree of confidence held by the investors will be conditioned by many factors.>>>
<<<Such factors will include the technical analysis of the aircraft performance in comparison with competing designs and the expectation of the total world market for the aircraft.>>>
<<<The design team will be expected to provide such analysis.>>>
<<<A major difficulty in assessing the financial success of a project is the long timescales involved in aircraft design and development.>>>
<<<The factors which influence financial viability are often considered over shorter time cycles than those associated with typical aircraft developments.>>>
<<<Within this environment it is not surprising that funding is sometimes difficult to find for new projects.>>>
<<<Such  reluctance leads to national /governmental involvement in aircraft projects.>>>
<<<This further complicates a pure financial analysis as political issues may be have to be considered.>>>
<<<Although aircraft manufacturers are in business to exploit advances in technology the financial restrictions mentioned above make them somewhat conservative in the development of new designs.>>>
<<<If a revolutionary innovation ran into technical/operational difficulties it could ruin the company.>>>
<<<A lot of technical effort needs to be put into building confidence in new methods before they are accepted for production.>>>
<<<The difficulties of using ROI as the design criterion have led to the adoption of life-cycle cost analysis.>>>
<<<This involves the summation of all the cost elements associated with purchasing, operating and supporting the aircraft throughout the operational life.>>>
<<<Although this parameter can be used for both military and civil projects, the components in the total cost equation differ for each sector.>>>
<<<For civil aircraft a lot of data is available from past aircraft and operations, on which to base such analysis.>>>
<<<Each airline has developed its own methods for estimating operating expenses related to their particular type of operation, flight patterns, aircraft fleet and accounting procedures.>>>
<<<The aircraft manufacturer will have to subject the projected aircraft, in competition with others, to the particular cost method of potential customer airlines.>>>
<<<Since these methods vary widely between different operators it is necessary for the design team to use a standardised method for cost analysis, especially in the early stages of the design.>>>
<<<Such methods are used to provide guidance in the choice of values for the fundamental operational and design parameters.>>>
<<<It is difficult to rationalise the design of the aircraft to different cost methods so a choice has to be made.>>>
<<<Whichever method is chosen it can be used only to show the relative cost variation between different designs.>>>
<<<The method will not predict actual costs as these vary so widely over different operational practices.>>>
<<<There are several different standardised methods available but they all trace their origin to the 'Standard Method of Estimating Comparative Direct Operating Costs of Turbine Powered Transport Airplanes' (Air Transport Association of America, Dec. 1967).>>>
<<<Most standard cost methods only estimate the direct operating costs of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The total cost of owning and operating an aircraft is the sum of indirect operating costs (IOC) and DOC.>>>
<<<Although both costs may be influenced by the type of aircraft under consideration (e.g.>>>
<<<fleet mix) it is common practice to consider the two cost components separately.>>>
<<<In an inflationary economic climate, values for costs are highly time-dependent; therefore some effort must be made to secure current prices for the various elements that make up the total operating cost.>>>
<<<Alternatively, old prices must be 'factored' to account for changes since publication.>>>
<<<This factoring requires the use of an inflation index.>>>
<<<Traditionally such an index is difficult to determine but as the cost method used in aircraft design is employed only to estimate relative costs the exact evaluation of the index may be less significant than for absolute cost predictions.>>>
<<<Cost values are however 'date sensitive' and any published data must show the year to which costs refer.>>>
<<<American airlines are compelled to submit cost information to the government and this is collated and published annually in 'Aircraft Operating Costs and Performance Report' CAB Report (this data is used in Aviation Week quarterly/annual reports).>>>
<<<These reports are useful sources of cost updating information.>>>
<<<Although in project studies only relative costs are considered care must be taken to ensure that the influence of individual variables is truly represented in the cost equation.>>>
<<<Indirect operating cost (IOC) IOC estimation methods deal with those costs not directly attributable to a particular aircraft type or the flying costs of a particular operation.>>>
<<<It may include some or all of the following expenses: • facility purchase cost and facility depreciation • facility leasing cost • facility maintenance cost • ground equipment depreciation • ground equipment maintenance costs • maintenance overheads • headquarters overheads • administration and technical services • advertising, promotion and sales expenses • public relations cost expenses • booking, ticket sales and commission • customer services • training In order to classify the above parameters for particular airlines the American Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) requires American airlines to report indirect costs associated within the following headings: aircraft and traffic servicing, promotion and sales, passenger services, general and administrative overhead, ground property and equipment maintenance and depreciation expenses.>>>
<<<Indirect operating costs obviously vary over a wide range depending on the type of operation and activity of the airline.>>>
<<<Standard methods of estimating these costs are available (e.g.>>>
<<<'Boeing Operating Cost Ground Rules') and data are published on airline actual expenses (e.g.>>>
<<<the USA CAB annually publishes statistics and data in journals such as the Flight International and Aviation Week annual reviews).>>>
<<<Although aircraft design may have significant influence on indirect costs, for example by requiring new maintenance facilities and the introduction of new skills for advances in technology, it is difficult to quantify the exact cost of the inter- relationship.>>>
<<<Airline management and operational aspects are predominant factors in the indirect costs and these are outside the control of the aircraft designer.>>>
<<<It is therefore usual to ignore the effects of indirect cost on the selection of aircraft design parameters.>>>
<<<As the variation in direct operating costs of competing aircraft and airlines narrows, the influence of IOC will become much more significant and aircraft sales teams will use reductions in the indirect costs to show their product to advantage over competitors (e.g.>>>
<<<through savings in fleet commonality).>>>
<<<Indirect operating costs are not insignificant; they can account for between 15 and 50% of the total operating expenses (i.e.>>>
<<<up to the same cost as the direct operational expenses).>>>
<<<Direct operating costs (DOC) Under the DOC category all the costs associated with flying and direct maintenance must be considered.>>>
<<<Figure 12.2 shows a typical breakdown of these costs.>>>
<<<Some standardised DOC methods do not include all the factors shown in Fig.>>>
<<<12.2.>>>
<<<The cost components may be considered under four broad headings: Airframe cost Engine cost Avionics cost Loans cost Aircraft cost Spares cost R and D cost Total aircraft price Depreciation rate Depreciation Insurance rate Insurance cost Interest rate Loan repayments Airframe cost Maintenance cost Engine cost Overhead Crew cost Flight operation cost Fuel / oil cost Airport fees Total direct operating cost (DOC) Fig.>>>
<<<12.2 Direct operating cost components.>>>
<<<• standing charges • flight costs • maintenance costs • cost parameters A description of each of these headings is given below.>>>
<<<Standing charges These are the proportion of the costs that are not directly linked to the aircraft flight but may be regarded as the 'overhead' on the flight.>>>
<<<Such costs, in order of importance, include: 1. depreciation of the capital investment 2. interest charges on capital employed 3. aircraft insurance Depreciation and interest charges are sometimes quoted as an item and referred to as 'ownership' costs.>>>
<<<Items 2 and 3 are ignored in some cost methods as they are small components compared to the cost of depreciation; however, these items will be discussed first.>>>
<<<Insurance cost This is directly related to the risks involved and the potential for claims following loss.>>>
<<<The airworthiness authorities oversee the observance of the safety standard; therefore the risk of accident is well established.>>>
<<<For the insurance companies the associated technical risk is relatively easy to estimate as it is associated directly with the probability of failure of the total aircraft system.>>>
<<<Above this baseline risk is the possibility of losing aircraft due to non-technical occurrence (e.g.>>>
<<<terrorism) and the subsequent potential for personal claims.>>>
<<<Such risks are difficult to determine in advance due to the sometimes transient nature of the problem.>>>
<<<Insurance companies will therefore vary their fee in relation to the nature of the operation (e.g.>>>
<<<geographical areas of flights) and the level of airline security.>>>
<<<The annual premiums for aircraft insurance vary between 1 and 3% of the aircraft price.>>>
<<<If insurance is to be included in the cost method a value of 1.5% is considered typical.>>>
<<<Interest charges Interest charges are impossible to quantify in a general analysis as the banks and government agencies will charge various fees to different customers.>>>
<<<Such charges will be dependent on the world economic climate, local exchange rates, the credit standing of the purchaser and the export encouragement given by the national government of the airline or manufacturer.>>>
<<<Further complications may arise due to 'off-set' agreements made between the two trading partners (manufacturer and airline).>>>
<<<For all these reasons, and because most of these factors are outside the influence of the aircraft manufacturer, many cost estimation methods ignore this cost component but it is necessary to include the interest costs in any business plan.>>>
<<<Current national base interest rates should be determined and used for such analysis.>>>
<<<Depreciation Depreciation will be dependent on many factors including the capital involved, the airline purchasing policies, the accounting practices of the financial loan companies, the competition for capital and the overall world economic conditions at the time the aircraft is purchased.>>>
<<<As the aircraft is always maintained to a fully airworthy condition throughout its life, it will have an identifiable value when sold (known as the residual value).>>>
<<<As with any capital item, the residual value will reduce as the aircraft ages.>>>
<<<The depreciation period will be dependent on the accountancy policy of the airline and the expected development of the routes for which the aircraft is bought to service.>>>
<<<Typically, an aircraft may be considered to be at the end of its useful life after 15-20 years with zero residual value.>>>
<<<With civil aircraft design methods reaching a mature technology state the useful life of aircraft is progressively extending with 20-30 years likely to become more common in the next decade.>>>
<<<The choice of depreciation period and the estimation of residual value is made by the purchasing airline (* e.g.>>>
<<<12 years depreciation to 15% residual value).>>>
<<<The main parameter in the evaluation of depreciation is the total price of the aircraft.>>>
<<<The initial aircraft price used in the evaluation of depreciation will include an allowance for the capital required to provide for spares holding (typically 10-15% of the aircraft initial price).>>>
<<<Therefore aircraft initial price = factory cost of the aircraft + spares cost The percentage of the first cost of the aircraft to be depreciated per year can be determined as: [(initial price — residual value)/initial price]/(depreciation period/100) For example in the case above * the equation will give: [(P - 0.15P)/P]/[12/100] = 7.08% where P = aircraft manufacturer's price (including airframe, engines, systems and online equipment).>>>
<<<The estimation of aircraft price is complicated by many non-engineering factors (e.g.>>>
<<<market conditions, competition, politics, off-set trade agreements, inter- national collaboration on manufacture, etc.).>>>
<<<The president of one of the largest aircraft manufacturers once said, 'The price of an airplane .>>>

<<<.>>>
<<<has little direct relationship to the design and production costs of the vehicle.'>>>
<<<Nevertheless the price of an aircraft must be sufficiently high to allow a reasonable return on investment for the manufacturer and sufficiently low to allow an adequate return on the purchase investment made by the operator.>>>
<<<A cynical view of this process is to state that the initial price of the aircraft (and engine) is set at what the customer will pay and not related to the technical manufacturing factors.>>>
<<<This may not be exactly true but it is known that the initial sales prices of a new aircraft type are always set low to enable the manufacturer to gain market penetration.>>>
<<<Also, when the aircraft type is old the manufacturer will quote low prices against competing new aircraft, in the knowledge that the development costs for his aircraft have been recovered.>>>

<<<However, the data can be used to determine aircraft price in the project design phase, as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<12.3.>>>
<<<With the complexity and uncertainty of factors associated with the market price for aircraft it is surprising that there is not more variability in the price of aircraft per pound of aircraft empty mass (OEM).>>>
<<<Such a crude plot should not be used for particular aircraft analysis as the range of aircraft size covered is too extensive (100-500 passengers).>>>
<<<A more detailed analysis should be made around the size of aircraft under consideration (e.g.>>>
<<<if only aircraft less than 200 000 Ib were analysed on the data above a different average-line would have been drawn).>>>
<<<There is a strong argument in favour of using aircraft parameters other than OEM for determining aircraft price (e.g.>>>
<<<maximum take-off mass, aircraft speed, number of passengers, etc.).>>>
<<<Each design study should consider which parameter is most appropriate.>>>
<<<There are several data sources available from which aircraft price information can be obtained (e.g.>>>
<<<The Avmark Aviation Economist database of jet airliner values).>>>
<<<These should be used to build a database for the particular design.>>>
<<<Care must be taken when using price data to normalise the values to account for inflation and the devaluation of currencies.>>>
<<<In some cost evaluation methods there is an option to allow for leasing of aircraft to be substituted for purchasing.>>>
<<<There are several methods available for determining aircraft manufacturing costs from the configuration and system details (e.g.>>>
<<<J Burns, SAWE Paper No 2228, 1994).>>>
<<<The total cost can be considered as the sum of the design costs (which is a function of the technical complexity of the design), the overhead cost of development (which is a non-recurring cost independent of the number of aircraft produced) and the production cost (which is directly related to the number of  aircraft produced, the complexity of the design and the number of co-operating manufacturing companies).>>>
<<<The design and overhead costs occur in the early years of the design and manufacture cycle.>>>
<<<In the early years these costs will be a large component of the sales cost, but as the design matures and sales increase the design and development cost will be repaid and eventually form a relatively small element in the sale price.>>>
<<<For a constant production volume, the manufacturing cost will start low (because some of the early production cost will be regarded as development) but quickly stabilise to a constant value.>>>
<<<The capital requirements for each cost will depend on the type of aircraft, the complexity of the design and the method of manufacture.>>>
<<<A new aircraft design will involve more design and development capital than a derivative (e.g.>>>
<<<stretched) aircraft.>>>
<<<The MD study for a 150 seat regional jet mentioned earlier showed the estimated total programme cost for a new and derived design as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<12.4.>>>
<<<The overhead cost may be regarded as a small part of the total cost only if sufficient numbers of aircraft can be produced (and sold).>>>
<<<Dividing the total cost associated with the design, development and manufacturing cost, by the number produced gives the unit cost (aircraft break-even price) as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<12.5.>>>
<<<This analysis determines the average cost of producing each aircraft, evaluated at the end of the productive life of the design.>>>
<<<The problem for the manufacturers is that they do not know at the start of the project how many aircraft will be produced so the average price study is not used as a basis for fixing the initial aircraft price.>>>
<<<Setting a constant price for a new aircraft sale ($57M and $50M on the above figure) allows a break-even production quantity to be predicted (i.e.>>>
<<<about 250 and 350 aircraft respectively).>>>

<<<About two years ahead of delivery the manufacturer will ask for progressive stage payments up to about one third of the sale price.>>>
<<<These cash inputs help with the manufacturers' cash flow and show goodwill from the customer.>>>
<<<Note, in the above analysis the manufacturer's cash flow break-even point lies between six and nine years from the start of the project.>>>
<<<The variability is caused by the uncertainty in the number of aircraft produced.>>>
<<<A stabilised production volume will only arise after about six years from the start of the production process.>>>
<<<The differences between new and derived designs in the above analysis illustrates the variability in the assessment of aircraft production cost.>>>
<<<Although constant sales price was assumed in the analysis, experience shows this is not the normal market practice.>>>
<<<As mentioned earlier, the average price will be discounted at the start and towards the end of the production run.>>>
<<<The only rule that seems to apply to the price of aircraft is that it is set to suit the market and not as a calculation from the design and production cost.>>>
<<<However, on average, the manufacturer needs to make a profit from the sales to stay in business and the airline must make a profit from the purchase.>>>
<<<In some studies it is desirable to include the engine cost as a separate item from the aircraft price.>>>
<<<In this way the optimum aircraft design (from an aircraft DOC standpoint) can be determined.>>>
<<<Engine price is largely dependent on the take-off thrust with a small overhead to account for non-thrust dependent cost com- ponents.>>>

Leasing For accountancy purposes, sometimes related to local taxation policies, some airlines lease their aircraft from a third party in preference to outright purchase.>>>
<<<The cost method reflects this option by eliminating the standing charge element and then calling the DOC value a 'Cash DOC.>>>
<<<Maintenance costs Prediction of maintenance costs is complicated by the lack of definition for items to be included under this heading.>>>
<<<Setting up a maintenance facility is an expensive outlay for the airline.>>>
<<<Some such facilities run as a separate business.>>>
<<<The capital cost of buildings, the administration costs and the cost of special equipment may be regarded as an indirect cost on the total maintenance operation and included in the IOC evaluation.>>>
<<<This suits the aircraft manufacturer as the evaluation of DOC would be proportionately reduced.>>>
<<<The attribution of the maintenance overhead burden forms the biggest variability in the different standard methods for estimating DOC.>>>
<<<Some airlines contract-out their aircraft and engine maintenance to other airlines or specialised maintenance companies.>>>
<<<In these cases the total  charge for maintenance will be automatically set against DOC as the cost will be directly attributable to a specific aircraft.>>>
<<<Maintenance charges include labour and material costs associated with routine inspections, servicing and overhaul (for airframe, engines, avionics, systems, accessories, etc.).>>>
<<<There will also be some non-revenue flying involved and this will be charged to the maintenance account.>>>
<<<Generalised estimation of the total costs involved has always presented difficulties due to the variability of maintenance tasks for different aircraft and the variations in the types of operation.>>>
<<<All the standard DOC methods include procedures for estimating maintenance costs but care must be taken when adapting these standardised methods to particular designs.>>>
<<<It is common practice to divide the maintenance tasks into airframe and engine components giving: total maintenance cost = cost of airframe maintenance + cost of engine maintenance + maintenance burden (overhead cost) The airframe and engine maintenance costs are further sub-divided into labour and material components, for example: airframe maintenance cost = cost of labour + cost of materials Furthermore, each component cost is considered to be the sum of a cost per flight (flight overhead) and the cost per flying hour (recurrent charge).>>>
<<<For example the cost of airframe labour maintenance is defined as: airframe labour cost = (labour cost per stage + labour cost per flying hour x stage time) x labour rate The total maintenance burden is often based on a standing charge to cover the overhead cost of providing the maintenance service plus an hourly cost, as shown below: maintenance burden = standing cost + hourly charge x block time/stage Hence the components of the maintenance cost are: 1. airframe maintenance labour cost per stage 2. airframe maintenance labour cost per flying hour 3. airframe maintenance material cost per stage 4. airframe maintenance cost per flying hour 5. engine maintenance labour cost per stage 6. engine maintenance labour cost per flying hour 7. engine maintenance material cost per stage 8. engine maintenance material cost per flying hour 9. maintenance burden standing charge 10. maintenance burden hourly (flying) charge Items 5-8 are sometimes reduced to a simple maintenance cost per flying hour obtained from the engine supplier.>>>
<<<Flight costs This cost element comprises all the costs which are directly associated with the flight.>>>
<<<The following items are summed to give the total flying costs per hour: 1. crew cost 2. fuel and oil usage 3. landing and navigational charges Crew costs These include the salaries for the flight and cabin staff.>>>
<<<Crew productivity has increased over the last ten years with the increased acceptance of two-pilot operation.>>>
<<<The number of crew is dictated by airworthiness standards and labour union agreements.>>>
<<<Typically there will be two flight crew for smaller aircraft travelling shorter stages, three for heavier aircraft and for long-range flights it is sometimes necessary to have more than one set of flight crew on the flight.>>>
<<<The number of cabin staff is associated with the number of passengers (30-50 passengers per cabin attendant is typical).>>>
<<<Annual utilisation of crew varies depending on staff contracts.>>>
<<<Eight hundred hours a year is typical for a medium size regional jet aircraft operation.>>>
<<<Wage rates differ between airlines and between aircraft type so it is difficult to generally assess crew costs.>>>
<<<The following relationship can be used: crew costs = (annual cost of flight crew member x number of flight crew + annual cost of cabin staff member x number of cabin staff) x (flight block hour)/(crew utilisation per year) Note, flight and cabin staff utilisation is likely to be different, cabin staff having a higher utilisation.>>>
<<<Crew cost will include overheads for enforced stop-overs on long-range schedules.>>>
<<<These expenses are sometimes treated as a general operating cost and therefore considered as indirect costs.>>>
<<<Fuel and oil The cost of fuel and oil is relatively easy to estimate providing the price of fuel can be accurately predicted.>>>
<<<Next to depreciation, fuel cost represents the most significant cost parameter in the design.>>>
<<<A historical survey of fuel price over a 20-year period shows the difficulty of making this prediction.>>>
<<<Figure 12.7 shows how the price of fuel has varied between 50 and 350% of the baseline value in only a 20-year period (due mainly to the imposition of cartel trading by the oil suppliers in the late 1970s).>>>
<<<With such variability it is difficult to confidently predict fuel price in the future.>>>
<<<Cost parameters All the preceding costs are calculated on an hourly (flight) basis.>>>
<<<They are all summed to produce the direct operating cost of the aircraft per flight hour.>>>
<<<The Baseline fuel price set at 1974 cost l e u f f o t s o c e v i t a l e R Fig.>>>
<<<12.7 Fuel price variability (data source AIAA-86-2667).>>>
<<<Year cost of flying a particular route (known as the stage cost) is found by multiplying the hourly DOC by the block time (hours).>>>
<<<The stage cost can be divided by the block distance to show the mile cost.>>>
<<<The mile cost can be divided by the maximum number of seats flown on the stage (note not the number of seats occupied as this will vary with airline schedules) to provide the seat mile cost.>>>
<<<Some manufacturers quote all the above cost parameters on a cash basis, by which they mean that the aircraft standing charge is not included in the total cost.>>>
<<<Their reasoning for doing this (apart from making the DOC figure much lower) is that it is becoming common practice for airlines to lease their aircraft on an annual basis and therefore this cost becomes a different part of the company balance sheet.>>>
<<<Be careful when using quoted DOC figures from manufacturers or the aeronautical press to understand if the total or cash method of calculating the values has been used.>>>
<<<Design influence Aircraft project designers are seen to influence costs directly by the basic configuration of the aircraft (system complexity, aircraft size, engine size, etc.)>>>
<<<and the selected performance (cruise speed, range, etc.).>>>
<<<All these aspects will have a substantial input to the cost model through the standing charges, the fuel used and the maintenance required.>>>
<<<The designers also influence cost indirectly through airline economics (market size, ticket price, aircraft performance, passenger appeal).>>>
<<<These indirect factors feed into the cost analysis through revenue potential, the demand for the aircraft type, market development and ultimately to commonality and type derivations.>>>
<<<It is important for the designers to recognise  these influences in the early stage of the aircraft project so that the design can meet the market potential and thereby maximise success of the project.>>>
<<<It will be necessary to conduct several parametric trade-off studies to fully understand the various competing aspects of the design.>>>
<<<It is unusual for the design team to consider the aircraft as a 'point-design' aimed exclusively at one market sector.>>>
<<<The initial design will be slightly compromised to allow for future stretch (increased payload and/or range) to extend the market for the aircraft type.>>>
<<<Example To illustrate how the direct costs are calculated consider an aircraft with the following details: 300 7200 nm MO.825 number of seats range at maximum payload cruise speed (at a representative altitude this equates to a speed of 243 m/s) aircraft maximum take-off mass engine take-off thrust (two engines) cruise SFC fuel consumption aircraft utilisation engine maintenance airframe maintenance 243 200 kg 370 kN (each engine) 0.55 5500 kg/hr (each engine) 4200 hr / year $ 190 / hr / engine $660 / hr (labour) and $218 / hr (materials) Estimating the standing charges We shall first estimate the 'standing charge' element in the DOC calculation.>>>
<<<From a graph similar to Fig.>>>
<<<12.2, drawn for aircraft of similar size (weight) to the proposed design, we can determine the aircraft price.>>>
<<<Using the MTOM quoted above and assuming an empty weight fraction of 58% (typical of this size aircraft) we estimate the empty weight and then the aircraft price: OEM = 0.58 x MTOM = 0.58 x 243 200 = 141 100 kg From the cost graph (Fig.>>>
<<<12.3) at this weight: total aircraft price = $M118 Using the quoted engine SFC and derating the take-off thrust to the cruise condition allows an estimate of the engine price to be made using the value function shown in Chapter 9: value function = (cruise thrust)088(5FC)"258 The graph of current engine prices gives a value of $M9.8 per engine.>>>
<<<There are two engines; therefore cost of engines = $M19.6, making the cost of airframe = SM98.4 and giving: total aircraft factory price = $M118 Assuming the cost of aircraft spares is 10% of the airframe price and the cost of engine spares is 30% of the engine price we can determine the total spares cost: spares cost = (0.1 x 98.4) + (0.3 x 19.6) = $M15.7 Adding the spares cost to the total aircraft factory price gives: total investment cost = 118 + 15.7 = $M133.7 Assuming that this cost is depreciated to 10% over a 16-year operational life gives an annual cost of: depreciation costs/year = 0.9 x 133.7/16 = SM7.52 Assuming interest on investment cost is set at 5.4% per year, the annual cost will be increased by: interest/year = 0.054 x 133.7 = SM7.22 Assume insurance is charged at 0.5% of aircraft cost: insurance/year = 0.005 x 118 = SM0.59 Hence the total annual standing charge is: total standing charge/year = 7.52 + 7.22 + 0.59 = SM15.33 Dividing this by the quoted aircraft utilisation per year of 4200 hours gives: standing charge/flying hour = $3650 Estimating the flying costs Assume two flight crew at $360 per hour and nine cabin crew at $90 per hour are used: crew costs/hr = (2 x 360) + (9 x 90) = $1530 Assume landing fees are charged at $6 per ton (of aircraft MTO): landing charge = 0.006 x 243 200 = $1459 Assume navigational charges of $5640 per flight for this type of aircraft.>>>
<<<Assume ground handling charges of $11 per passenger per flight.>>>
<<<For a 300-passenger aircraft this gives: ground handling = 11 x 300 = $3300 Therefore airport charges are: total airport charge = 1459 + 5640 + 3300 = $10399 per flight In order to relate this cost to the aircraft flying hours it is necessary to determine the block time of the flight.>>>
<<<For the cruise phase of 7200 nm and with the aircraft travelling at M0.825 (a cruise speed of 473 kt) the time taken is: cruise time = 7200/473 = 15.22hr To this must be added the time for climb and descent and the time on the ground.>>>
<<<As part of the 7200 nm stage distance will be covered in the climb and descent phases and the aircraft speed will be reasonably high in these parts of the flight profile, assume 10 minutes lost time.>>>
<<<Assume 20 minutes for start-up, taxi-out and take-off, eight minutes for hold prior to landing and five minutes for landing and taxi to stop: total extra time on flight =10 + 2 0 + 8 + 5 = 43 min (= 0.72 hr) Hence: block time = 15.22 + 0.72 = 15.94hr The above airport charges can now be related to flying hours: = 10399/15.94 = $669/hr The fuel consumption is quoted as 5500kg/hr per engine at cruise.>>>
<<<During the non-cruise phases the fuel consumption would be higher than this but on this long- range design it will be sufficiently accurate to ignore these increases.>>>
<<<Converting the fuel consumption to US gallons using the conversion factors and fuel density quoted in Data E, gives: typical jet fuel density = 800 kg/m3 volume of fuel used = 5500/800 (per engine) = 6.875 m3 = 6875 litres (conversion: 1 US gallon = 3.785 litres) volume of fuel =1816 US gallons With two engines, the aircraft will burn (2x18 116) = 3632 gallons/hr.>>>
<<<The cost of fuel is assumed to be 70c/US gallon.>>>
<<<Therefore: Fuel cost = 3632 x 0.7 = $2542/hr Maintenance costs These are relatively difficult to estimate in the initial project stage so values are used that are representative of the aircraft and engine types: engine (labour + materials) $ 190 / hr / engine airframe (labour) airframe (materials) $660/hr $218 / hr total maintenance cost = (2 x 190) + 660 + 218 = $1258/hr Total direct operating cost (a) Total DOC per flying hour.>>>

<<<For those operators that lease their aircraft the 'standing charge' estimated above may not form part of the direct operating cost analysis as the leasing contract may be accounted as an annual charge unrelated to the aircraft operation.>>>

<<<If lower load factors are to be assumed it is necessary to make more detailed modifications to the earlier cost analysis (e.g.>>>

<<<5.>>>
<<<Weights To establish a constant method of cost estimation it is necessary to precisely define various weight terms.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Pay load Within the limitations of the volumetric payload capacity and the structural payload capacity, the payload is equal to: aircraft take-off weight — (operating weight + weight of fuel) 2.>>>

<<<Structural pay load capacity Two limits to payload may frequently be imposed by structural strength considerations: (a) maximum zero fuel weight (b) maximum landing weight In the latter case the take-off weight must be such that the following total does not exceed the maximum landing weight: operating weight + payload + reserve fuel and oil The reserve fuel = (fuel carried + ground burn fuel consumed).>>>
<<<4.>>>
<<<Operating weight The operating weight is the weight of the aircraft fully equipped and ready for operation, including flight and cabin crew and their baggage, but less fuel, oil, and payload.>>>
<<<It includes expendable items such as anti- icing fluid, humidification, drinking, washing and galley water, and passenger amenities associated with the role of the aircraft.>>>
<<<If the fuel required for anti-icing, cabin heating, auxiliary power units, etc.>>>
<<<is drawn from the main tanks or if their operation affects engine consumption, a suitable allowance must be added to the fuel carried.>>>

<<<This process is satisfactory to determine the initial layout but the resulting design is highly conditional on the parameters defining the aircraft specification.>>>
<<<It is important that the designers understand the significance of the choice of the values used for the design specification and their influence on the aircraft configuration.>>>
<<<Methods are required that allow the designers to gain this understanding.>>>
<<<It is unusual for aircraft manufacturers to concentrate on one particular configuration.>>>
<<<Even when the initial set of requirements seems rigid, the manufacturers will be expecting to extend the design into new markets.>>>
<<<For example, most new civil aircraft designs will eventually form part of a family of aircraft with different payload/range specifications.>>>
<<<This will involve stretching (and in some cases shortening) the original design.>>>
<<<Furthermore, the aircraft manufacturer will want to offer the design with alternative engines so that a competitive engine market is maintained.>>>
<<<Also in some cases the civil aircraft may be converted into military transports or used for maritime patrol and reconnaissance.>>>
<<<For all the reasons mentioned above the aircraft configuration selected in the project stage may not be exactly matched to the initial specification.>>>
<<<The degree of compromise on the initial design is a difficult decision area for the designers.>>>
<<<The initial configuration will not be successful if it is made too inefficient compared to its competitors, but without the potential for later development the future success of the project would be jeopardised.>>>
<<<The method by which the designers select the initial 'baseline' design involves the use of parametric studies.>>>
<<<This chapter describes how the aircraft initial design layout is used as the focus for further parametric studies.>>>
<<<After a brief general introduction to the methods used, an example is presented showing how different types of parametric study are used in a case study.>>>
<<<This example may be used to guide student project work and to allow a com- prehensive understanding of the design area before finalising the aircraft configuration.>>>
<<<Further examples of parametric studies are included in the case studies following Chapter 15.>>>
<<<Introduction Parametric studies are normally conducted around a known design.>>>
<<<This is called the 'baseline aircraft'.>>>
<<<The studies are used to determine the sensitivity of the design parameters at this design point.>>>
<<<For those parameters shown to be sensitive to change, the designers will need to make a careful selection of the value to be used on the proposed design or to make adjustment to the layout to reduce the dependency on the parameter.>>>
<<<Conversely, for those parameters that are seen to be uncritical to the effectiveness of the layout the designers may have more flexibility in the selection of the value to be used.>>>
<<<For most aircraft designs there are many parameters that could be investigated in such studies.>>>
<<<To keep the multi-variable design problem manageable it is preferable to consider only one or two variables in any specific study.>>>
<<<For example in a parametric study of wing layout, the baseline layout may be held constant except for changes to the aircraft wing area and aspect ratio.>>>
<<<In another case, the suitability of different types of engine may be studied with everything else on the configuration kept constant.>>>
<<<Further parametric studies may be conducted to investigate the introduction of a new technology (e.g.>>>
<<<by showing the influence of new materials and manufacturing methods on aircraft structure weight).>>>
<<<The list of possible studies is long and it is up to the design team to use experience to select the types of study and the parameters to vary.>>>
<<<The team must select the type of study on the basis of those aspects that are most influential to the particular design.>>>
<<<Nine-point studies For a parametric investigation involving two variables the classical nine-point study can be used.>>>
<<<In a particular aircraft design study, variable x could be 'wing loading', variable y the 'thrust loading' and the objective function could be 'aircraft maximum take-off weight'.>>>
<<<At each of the nine points an aircraft will be fully designed to the appropriate values x and y.>>>
<<<When all nine designs have been determined a carpet plot can be drawn to show the variation of the designs against aircraft weight as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<13.1.>>>
<<<Note, that for each design point all aircraft parameters (geometry, mass, performance, cost, etc.)>>>
<<<will have been evaluated.>>>
<<<Similar carpets could be plotted for any of the overall design parameters.>>>
<<<The 'baseline design point' is often chosen as the centre point in the nine-point study to show positive and negative changes.>>>
<<<In association with the x and y variables a third parameter could be varied.>>>
<<<Variable z could be the 'number of passengers'.>>>
<<<Such three-variable studies produce a series of carpet plots as shown in Fig.>>>

<<<13.3 Single-parameter studies (fixed engine size).>>>
<<<Wing taper ratio Single-variable studies Single-parameter studies are sometimes used to show the sensitivity of the design to a particular variable (e.g.>>>
<<<direct operating cost, DOC, and aircraft price vs taper ratio).>>>
<<<In such studies all other parameters are held constant (e.g.>>>
<<<wing area and engine size).>>>
<<<The change in the variable will have secondary effects on some of the operating characteristics (e.g.>>>
<<<climb rate, range) and care must be taken that the resulting aircraft in the study are feasible (i.e.>>>
<<<meet all the aircraft specifications and constraints).>>>
<<<Figure 13.3 shows a typical single-variable study, in this case an investigation into wing taper ratio.>>>
<<<Example To illustrate the use of parametric studies in aircraft project design this example considers the design of a small (50-seat) regional jet.>>>
<<<The basic specification calls for a 48-seat aircraft flying over a lOOOnm single stage length with normal reserves and operating out of a 5300 ft field at + 25° ISA.>>>

<<<13.4 Baseline configuration.>>>
<<<The first parametric study to be conducted concerns the sensitivity of the choice of wing aspect ratio.>>>
<<<Point design studies were conducted at a range of input values of aspect ratio from 8.5 to 10.5.>>>
<<<This involved a complete redesign of the baseline aircraft to meet the required specification shown above.>>>
<<<At each of the selected aspect ratio values the aircraft weight, wing area and DOC changed from the baseline design.>>>
<<<Various aircraft parameters are plotted in Fig.>>>
<<<13.5.>>>
<<<The combined effects of structure weight and fuel usage resulting from the change in aspect ratio is seen in each parameter.>>>
<<<The influence of span loading on climb performance and thereby the WAT (weight, altitude, temperature) constraint is clearly shown at low values of wing aspect ratio.>>>
<<<The study shows the optimum choice of aspect ratio to be 9.22 for minimum DOC.>>>
<<<Varying aircraft geometrical parameters, as in the study above, is relatively simple as these are direct inputs to the estimating equations used in the design process.>>>
<<<Altering a principal operational parameter (e.g.>>>
<<<landing field length, LFL) involves much more iteration in the design calculations.>>>
<<<Nevertheless, it is important to show the sensitivity of such parameters on aircraft geometry as shown in the next study (see Fig.>>>
<<<13.6).>>>
<<<As all the details of the aircraft are evaluated at each value of the parameter (LFL above) it is possible to plot other sensitivities (e.g.>>>
<<<empty weight, fuel usage, etc.).>>>
<<<When all the operating parameters have been analysed it may be necessary to review the original specification.>>>
<<<More fundamental changes to the aircraft specification may be linked to future design options.>>>
<<<For example, it is likely that the aircraft engine will be developed Optimum for DOC (AR = 9.22) OEM Base Base DOC/flight Base DOC Wing Area OEM Wing area Wing aspect ratio Fig.>>>

<<<during the design life of the aircraft, providing more thrust.>>>
<<<To study the influence of engine changes further sensitivity studies can be conducted using the engine scaling relationships described in Chapter 9.>>>
<<<In the current study the baseline engine is assumed to be developed into more powerful versions.>>>
<<<The engine scale is the ratio of the developed thrust to the original baseline aircraft value.>>>
<<<Figure 13.7 shows the effect on aircraft size, performance and costs which results from the adoption of more powerful engines on the original specification.>>>
<<<The curves in Fig.>>>
<<<13.7 show the conflicting influences between different par- ameters.>>>
<<<For example, aircraft price will increase due to the more expensive and larger aircraft and engines but due to the increased thrust available the cruise speed will increase thereby reducing the stage time and raising the possibility of higher utilisation per year.>>>
<<<Such studies may dictate an initial specification which is slightly less optimum for the early designs but has the capacity to handle future developments more efficiently.>>>

<<<The relative position of the missing segment in the main graph and the shaded segment indicates the sensitivity of the design to engine thrust improvement.>>>
<<<Finally, the regional-jet design study was extended to consider engine designs.>>>
<<<Such studies assume that the engine size is exactly matched to the aircraft requirements (known as 'rubber' engines).>>>
<<<Although totally impractical in reality as engines are only available at specific sizes, these studies show the best combination of aircraft and engine integration.>>>
<<<Such studies show the compromise that must be accommodated by the design in using an existing engine sized differently from the optimum.>>>

<<<It is important to record these in a report that other people can understand.>>>
<<<The conventional format for this report is called the Aircraft Type Specification.>>>
<<<This includes all the detailed information that has been derived for the baseline design.>>>
<<<The report is a complete description of the aircraft that the design team expect to be produced.>>>
<<<The Type Specification therefore forms a focus for the conclusion of the project design phase.>>>
<<<For academic studies, the Type Specification acts as a useful planning sheet for the various detail studies that need to be conducted.>>>
<<<The various headings are used as an aide-memoire to the student.>>>
<<<They also act as a final report framework covering all the areas of the design which must be considered.>>>
<<<Obviously, for some students' work the level of detail in some of the specialist areas mentioned in the Type Specification may be too fine to be considered (this must not be used as an excuse for avoiding work!).>>>
<<<One of the main uses of this section of the book, for student project work, is in the organisation and planning of the project.>>>
<<<The main headings can be used to identify the various tasks to be undertaken.>>>
<<<They can be used to allocate and plan the progress of work throughout the course.>>>
<<<This section can be used to guide the students in their preparation of the final project report.>>>
<<<For student work the individual parts of the type record are not equal; their relative importance will depend on the nature of the study.>>>
<<<For example, for some students' coursework the 'performance' section may be the main area of specialisation and for others the system descriptions will be the central issues.>>>
<<<Finalisation of the Type Specification often forms the conclusion to the work of the initial project design group.>>>
<<<This chapter therefore concludes the first part of the book and leads to the design studies in the next part.>>>
<<<Type record From the start of the conceptual phase and all the way through the subsequent design processes, details of the aircraft configuration are continuously refined.>>>
<<<As time allows, more information about the layout is sought to enable better estimates of the aircraft parameters to be produced.>>>
<<<This will involve progressively considering more details of the aircraft structure and systems.>>>
<<<For example, at the start of the process the design knowledge about the tail will only consist of a guessed tail arm and a crude estimate of area.>>>
<<<At the end of the project phase the detail design of the tail, fin, rear fuselage, the control surfaces, control movements and forces, and all the aircraft systems will be known.>>>
<<<To record such detail the Aircraft Type Specification is created and used to summarise the current state of the aircraft design.>>>
<<<It is the responsibility of the design team leader to ensure that the information and data in the report are accurate and can be guaranteed by the company.>>>
<<<It is therefore a document that is continually evolving as design decisions are made right up to the time that the design is frozen.>>>
<<<The Type Specification document is a complete description of the manu- facturer's liability for the design.>>>
<<<It is a statement of what will be provided by the manufacturers for the sale price.>>>
<<<As such, it will eventually form part of the contract of sale and serve as the guarantee from the manufacturer.>>>
<<<With this background the document is treated seriously in the design organisation and will not contain any speculative statements, potentially misleading information or inaccurate data.>>>
<<<The report will consist of textural descriptions, drawings, numeric data, graphs and charts.>>>

<<<Introduction to spreadsheet methods Objectives Aircraft design is an iterative process, and therefore very labour intensive.>>>
<<<The designer is constantly striving to meet all the design specifications and airworthiness requirements, whilst offering the most cost-effective aircraft to the customer.>>>
<<<In the late 1940s, a number of engineers began to address this problem by attempting to automate the design process, using a mixture of mathematical and semi-empirical relationships.>>>
<<<However, the calculations still needed to be carried out by hand.>>>
<<<With the introduction of computers, designers realised that many of the labour intensive tasks could be achieved using computer programs but early programming languages were very specialised and difficult to use.>>>
<<<More recently, the power of desktop computers has enabled calculations to be performed using spreadsheet programs.>>>
<<<This section describes the use of spreadsheet programs for student projects in aircraft design.>>>
<<<This chapter is followed by several case studies using spread- sheet methods.>>>
<<<Introduction Computer programs used for aircraft design work have traditionally only been available for use on mainframe type computers.>>>
<<<In general they have been written in high-level, procedural languages, such as ADA and FORTRAN.>>>
<<<This is fine for industrial usage, but such systems require the user to be fluent in the appropriate computer language and know about the architecture of the program.>>>
<<<The power and flexibility of modern desktop computers has increased dramatically in the past few years.>>>
<<<However, there is still a gap between the predicted benefits of utilising computers and the actual benefits derived.>>>
<<<If a computer program or system is difficult to use, then prospective users will resort to their traditional design methods, i.e.>>>
<<<doing calculations by hand or batching work to large computers.>>>
<<<To exploit the capability of personal computers to their full extent, a more user-orientated approach is required when creating software.>>>
<<<This must involve higher learning rates, low error rates and increased usability of output data.>>>
<<<What is required is not a traditional high-level (procedural) program, but a program which has many of the required functions within its own structure and only requires a user to input the desired analytical method.>>>
<<<Spreadsheets1 appear to fit this description with their ability to carry out all but the most complex functions required.>>>
<<<This chapter details the methodology used to produce a spreadsheet suitable for student project design work.>>>
<<<The prime requirements for such programs are a modular design which will allow a variety of point estimates to be made and the ability to perform parametric studies.>>>
<<<The analysis modules necessary for initial project design work are described and the analytical methods used are briefly described.>>>
<<<In the following chapters spreadsheet programs are then applied to several example aircraft projects and the results are described.>>>
<<<Spreadsheet layout The layout chosen for an aircraft design spreadsheet will determine the overall usability.>>>
<<<Considering the need for modularity and the ability to perform parametric studies the layout shown in Table 15.1 is recommended.>>>
<<<Column A contains a descriptive label of the numerical value, either input or calculated.>>>
<<<Column B contains the variable name for the descriptive label.>>>
<<<This will either be a standard symbol such as S for gross wing area or an abbreviation of the descriptive label.>>>
<<<Finally, column C contains either numerical data (input) or a formula to estimate the value from other data in the spreadsheet.>>>
<<<Using this layout, column C may be copied and pasted several times to the right of itself.>>>
<<<Each of the pasted columns is a separate aircraft design and key input parameter, such as wing area, may be varied in each column.>>>
<<<Thus a parametric study has been set up with, for example, wing area as an input parameter.>>>
<<<The spreadsheet will then calculate the output values for each column and key output variables, for example maximum take-off weight, may be plotted against wing area.>>>
<<<Alternatively, for large spreadsheets, models may be generated to alter specific parameters in a specific manner.>>>
<<<As a particular parameter is varied, the required output parameters may be passed to another worksheet or workbook for use later.>>>
<<<Table 15.1 Spreadsheet layout Column A Column B Column C Descriptive Label Variable Name Numerical Value/Formula Modularity It is important that a modular layout is developed.>>>
<<<This will make the spreadsheet simpler to use, and allow modules to be easily changed for different design studies.>>>
<<<Typical modules required for initial project design are: 1. input data 2. atmospheric conditions 3. geometric calculations 4. mass model 5. cruise aerodynamic calculations 6. take-off performance 7. landing performance 8. second segment climb performance 9. centre of gravity model 10. cost model 11. direct operating cost (DOC) model The above list gives an indication of the modules required to successfully produce a satisfactory model from the initial specification.>>>
<<<Each of the modules will be discussed in turn.>>>
<<<1.>>>
<<<Input data Input data consists of the basic information used to define the shape, required performance and capabilities of the design.>>>
<<<Much of this information is generated as the initial estimates phase, whilst other parameters will be used directly from the design specification, e.g.>>>
<<<payload, range, cruise altitude, etc.>>>
<<<The data is used by the analytical modules to determine the weight, performance, cost, etc.>>>
<<<of a design.>>>
<<<Clearly the more detailed the analytical methods used, the more detailed the input data must be.>>>
<<<A balance has to be struck between the time available to obtain the required input data and the accuracy of the data output.>>>
<<<In most practical cases between 100 and 150 input values are required.>>>
<<<2.>>>
<<<Atmospheric conditions Central to any aircraft performance analysis is the need to know the atmospheric conditions at a particular altitude.>>>
<<<The model will be based around the international standard atmosphere (ISA) characteristics for the troposphere.>>>
<<<However, many transport aircraft now fly above the tropopause (i.e.>>>
<<<higher than 11km) and thus, in general, it is also necessary to model the characteristics of lower stratosphere.>>>
<<<While ISA the temperature (Atemp) to suit non-standard conditions is desired.>>>
<<<The module must be used at least twice [for the airfield conditions (altitude, Atemp) and is normally adopted, increase /decrease the ability to A Input data: Take-off: Altitude (m) Atemp (K) Cruise: Initial cruise altitude (m) Atemp (K) Constants: S/L ISA temperature (K) Pressure at S/L Viscosity at 273.15K (kgms"1) Lapse rate (K/m) Pressure at 11000m (Pa) Density at 11000m (kgm"3) Calculations: Take-off: Temperature (K) Pressure (Pa) Density at altitude (kgnT3) Absolute viscosity (kgms"1) Kinematic viscosity ( m V 1 ) Speed of sound (ms"1) Cruise: Temperature (K) Pressure (Pa) Density (kgms~3) Absolute viscosity (kgms"1) Kinematic viscosity ( m V 1 ) Speed of sound ( m s 1 ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Fig.>>>

<<<A spreadsheet module suitable for calculations in both the troposphere and stratosphere is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<15.1.>>>
<<<Note, in this example variable names have not been used as the module is reasonably compact.>>>
<<<3.>>>
<<<Geometric calculations The geometric calculations module determines the detailed geometry from the basic data input.>>>
<<<These calculations include determination of wetted areas, mean aerodynamic chords, etc.>>>
<<<Methodology described earlier in the book [Figs 7.19 and 8.2(b)] may be used, together with standard geometrical methods.>>>
<<<Output may be checked directly using the built-in graphing capabilities of spreadsheet packages.>>>
<<<Figure 15.2 shows the determination of equivalent wing planform for a cranked trailing edge wing, along with the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) for both the actual and equivalent wing planforms.>>>
<<<Actual planform Equivalent wing planform •M.A.C.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<15.2 Presentation of wing geometry using built-in spreadsheet facilities.>>>
<<<4.>>>
<<<Mass module The mass module determines the overall mass breakdown for the aircraft.>>>
<<<This module is generally iterative as many specific mass items are dependent on the maximum take-off mass of the aircraft.>>>
<<<An initial estimate of the maximum take- off mass is provided and the user can iterate this value manually to arrive at a final answer.>>>
<<<Convergence will normally be completed after approximately ten attempts.>>>
<<<Alternatively, the solver facilities available in many modern spreadsheet programs may be used to rapidly determine the maximum take-off mass.>>>
<<<For particularly complex spreadsheet models the built-in solvers are sometimes unable to determine a solution.>>>
<<<In such cases, macros may be generated to automate the iteration.>>>
<<<An example macro for this task using Visual Basic (Microsoft Excel) is shown below: Sub iyiacrol () Sheets("Sheetl").Select 10 If (Abs(Range("C12"))>0.01) Then Range("CIl").Select Selection.Copy Range("ClO").Select Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlValues, _ Operation: =xlNone, _ SkipBlanks:—False, Transpose:=False GoTo 10 End If End Sub The macro assumes that the worksheet is called 'Sheet 1' and that the computed mass is in cell CIl.>>>
<<<The initial estimate is defined in cell ClO.>>>
<<<The difference between the two values is computed in cell Cl2.>>>
<<<If the absolute difference between the initial estimate and the computed mass is greater than 0.01 then the initial estimate is replaced with the computed value.>>>
<<<Although very crude it converges rapidly to a solution.>>>
<<<Sheet names and cell references can easily be altered to suit the particular layout of your model.>>>
<<<5.>>>
<<<Cruise aerodynamic module The primary output from the cruise module is the aircraft cruise lift/drag ratio.>>>
<<<This is used to compute the fuel required for the mission under analysis and hence determine the maximum take-off mass for the mission.>>>
<<<To do this, the module computes the drag characteristics for the cruise flight condition using geometrical information.>>>
<<<In it simplest form, only a single cruise altitude will be analysed.>>>
<<<However, more advanced models may include stepped profiles with a number of cruise altitudes to more closely reflect operating practice.>>>
<<<It is convenient to check the engine power setting at this stage to make sure that the installed thrust is sufficient to meet the initial cruise requirements (normally 300ft/min climb rate).>>>
<<<To enable a drag prediction to be made input data for this module include the cruise conditions, geometric calculations and initial mass estimate.>>>
<<<Engine data is also required to convert the thrust required at the initial cruise altitude to a static sea-level thrust.>>>
<<<6.>>>
<<<Take-off module The take-off performance module determines the take-off field performance of the aircraft.>>>
<<<As well as computing the standard take-off field length it is often necessary to compute the balanced field length.>>>
<<<Here, the distance is computed for both the 'accelerate-go' and the 'accelerate-stop' phases.>>>
<<<For the accelerate-stop phase, braking is handled in a similar manner to the landing phase (see Chapter 10).>>>
<<<The balanced field length is then determined by altering the decision speed, V1, until both the 'accelerate-go' and the 'accelerate-stop' distances are equal.>>>
<<<Again this iteration may be handled within spreadsheets using the built-in solver or specialist macros.>>>
<<<Geometric data, aerodynamic characteristics and take-off mass are used to determine aircraft drag during the take-off run.>>>
<<<Installed engine thrust is then used to determine the acceleration during the take-off run.>>>
<<<If engine data is available to determine the thrust decay with aircraft speed the accuracy of the results is improved.>>>
<<<7.>>>
<<<Landing module The landing performance module determines the landing field performance of the aircraft.>>>
<<<As with take-off, aircraft drag is calculated using mass estimates and geometric data.>>>
<<<Depending upon the accuracy required, the landing phase may be broken into a small number of segments or an incremental procedure used.>>>
<<<The latter allows the effect of brake application, reverse thrust, speedbrakes and lift dumpers to be analysed but at considerable increase in computing time and complexity.>>>
<<<8.>>>
<<<Second segment climb module The second-segment climb performance module determines the climb gradient of the aircraft with one engine inoperative (OEI).>>>
<<<As discussed in Chapter 10, a civil transport aircraft must meet specific climb gradients depending on the number of engines (as defined in the airworthiness requirements).>>>
<<<The drag model in this case must take proper account of the increased drag from the wind-milling effect of the inoperative engine and also the increased drag due to control deflections associated with asymmetric powered flight.>>>
<<<9.>>>
<<<Centre of gravity module The centre of gravity module is essential for determination of the correct location of the wing to balance the aircraft.>>>
<<<Moments are taken about the nose for each component using the masses calculated in the mass module.>>>
<<<The centre of gravity is then calculated by summing the moments and masses to determine the aircraft centre of gravity distance from the nose.>>>
<<<This may then be expressed as a percentage of the wing mean aerodynamic chord (MAC).>>>
<<<If desired this module can be expanded to consider variations in passenger loading together with the centre of gravity of the aircraft in the operating empty condition.>>>
<<<10.>>>
<<<Aircraft cost and DOC module The aircraft cost module determines the 'price' the airline will need to buy the aircraft.>>>
<<<This may be estimated using a simple cost per kilogram relationship or by a detailed model using formulae to predict development and production costs.>>>
<<<The airframe and engine size are the primary input variables for the aircraft cost module.>>>
<<<The direct operating cost module determines the operating costs as perceived by the airline.>>>
<<<This is often a useful parameter for comparing designs.>>>
<<<It may also be used to optimise a given design.>>>
<<<Input variables include the fuel used, crew salaries, maintenance charges and the purchase cost of the aircraft.>>>
<<<Summary Together with second-segment climb performance, the field and cruise performance modules form the specific flight cases that 'size' the engine for a given design.>>>
<<<An optimum design will require the same 'size' engine to meet all three requirements.>>>
<<<In practice this may not be possible as often one of the three requirements may be dominant and therefore set the critical requirement.>>>
<<<Twin-engined aircraft are often found to be second-segment climb critical, while four-engined aircraft are likely to be climb critical (i.e.>>>
<<<top of climb performance).>>>
<<<The field case may be critical for any aircraft if the allowable runway is short.>>>
<<<Spreadsheet format the number of modules described produces quite a large Unfortunately spreadsheet.>>>
<<<If the all the modules are arranged on a single worksheet using the layout suggested the spreadsheet will be very long (>2000 rows).>>>
<<<It soon becomes tedious scrolling up and down past each module.>>>
<<<However, modern spreadsheets are three-dimensional in nature.>>>
<<<A traditional spreadsheet contains a series of rows and columns.>>>
<<<Three-dimensional spreadsheets continue this tradition but contain pages within a single file or workbook.>>>
<<<Data may be passed between the different worksheets just as it can be passed between cells on the same page.>>>
<<<It is then sensible to place individual modules on separate sheets.>>>
<<<This provides a strong structure to a spreadsheet model and reduces the length of each page resulting in less scrolling and better usability.>>>
<<<All sheets except the input data sheet may be locked to prevent changes by other users.>>>
<<<This is a useful feature for student project work in a group environment where one member may be responsible for specific model development.>>>
<<<Data handling Whilst many of the aircraft design methods are analytical in nature and thus relatively straightforward to enter into the spreadsheet model, experimental data, such as engine performance data, are sometimes more difficult to enter.>>>
<<<Where the data are one-dimensional (i.e.>>>
<<<dependent on one variable) curve fit and regression techniques may be used to generate functions for the data that can then be entered directly into the spreadsheet.>>>
<<<Care must be taken that such functions match the original data throughout the range of parameters anticipated, whilst being numerically efficient, i.e.>>>
<<<high-order polynomials should be avoided.>>>
<<<If at certain points the functions are no longer valid, appropriate error handling must be included to limit input parameter variation or else additional functions must be included to control certain parameters for extreme ranges of input values.>>>
<<<In many cases data are two-dimensional, i.e.>>>
<<<a parameter is dependent on two variables.>>>
<<<Linear interpolation may be used to determine values from these data.>>>
<<<Care must be taken with linear interpolation as this may upset some types of optimisation routines due to the sudden change of gradient between successive cells of data.>>>
<<<Alternatively, polynomial interpolation, used frequently for procedural programs, may be applied to spreadsheet methods.>>>
<<<A user-defined function is used to read in the tabular data from a specified worksheet and then determine the required value for the input parameters provided.>>>

<<<The design brief emphasised the importance of fuel cost to the design as it was felt that in future a 'carbon tax' may be levied on aviation fuel.>>>
<<<Initial research identified that many of the current 100-seat regional airliners are simply 'down-sized' variants of larger aircraft.>>>
<<<By basing the proposed family around a basic capacity of 70 passengers, it was felt that a more efficient design may be produced.>>>
<<<The introduction to the project briefly describes how the full specification was defined using data on current regional aircraft and current airline operating practices.>>>
<<<Initial estimates of the size and shape of the aircraft are then made in order to determine the necessary inputs to the spreadsheet model.>>>
<<<The model is then used to optimise the baseline design.>>>
<<<The minimising objective function was the aircraft direct operating cost (DOC).>>>
<<<The chapter concludes with data for the optimised design, together with a three-view general arrangement drawing.>>>
<<<Introduction Many 70-100-seat regional aircraft are now more than 20 years old providing a strong market for the introduction of a new regional aircraft.>>>
<<<Advances in technology should provide improvements over types such as the Douglas DC9 and Boeing 737-200.>>>
<<<It is interesting to note that many aircraft in this category have been 'down-sized' from larger models.>>>
<<<Such down-sized aircraft (e.g.>>>
<<<Fokker 70, Boeing 737-500/600) are not necessarily efficient designs.>>>
<<<Although the Fokker 100 was a new design in 1988, it was in essence a development of the Fokker F.28 and production has now ceased with the demise of Fokker.>>>
<<<The Avro RJ series, formally known as the British Aerospace BAe 146, has sold slowly, partly due to its four-engined configuration and perceived increased complexity.>>>

<<<This aircraft, now re-branded the Boeing 717, still utilises the DC9-30 wing and so does not employ the latest advances in technology introduced over the past decades.>>>
<<<In view of existing aircraft in this market segment it was decided that the baseline model should have a capacity for 70 passengers with the potential to produce a family of larger aircraft based around the initial model.>>>
<<<Emphasis has been placed on fuel efficiency from the outset as there is a risk of fuel price increases in the future via environmental taxes (referred to as a 'carbon tax').>>>
<<<From the initial brief given for the project, the aircraft capacity is fixed at 70 passengers.>>>
<<<This leaves several key parameters that must be determined in order to complete the specification of the aircraft.>>>
<<<These are: • design range • cruise speed • field length • initial cruise altitude The design range of the aircraft will affect the total weight and cost of the aircraft as well as the operational flexibility for the airline operator.>>>
<<<There are several methods by which the design range may be chosen.>>>
<<<In the first instance, a direct comparison with current regional aircraft can be made.>>>
<<<Table 16.1 provides the basic characteristics of several regional jet transport aircraft (taken from Data A).>>>
<<<The data shows that the design range increases with aircraft size.>>>
<<<However, these data give no indication of how these aircraft are currently operated.>>>
<<<Current operating practices may be analysed by investigating current airline operating schedules.>>>
<<<The routes flown by current regional aircraft can be identified and the ranges flown determined by estimating the great circle distance between airport pairs.>>>
<<<This is often a lengthy exercise.>>>

<<<Cruise speed for the design was determined by considering existing regional aircraft.>>>
<<<Maximum operating speed (Vmo) (EAS) and Mach number are listed in Table 16.3 (taken from Data A).>>>
<<<The normal operating Mach number is approximately 0.05 below the maximum value (Mnmo).>>>
<<<Thus from the table cruise Mach numbers are seen to be between M0.68 and M0.79.>>>
<<<Over the relatively short stages flown, the higher speeds offer little advantage in time saving, yet increase the thrust required and hence the total fuel burnt.>>>
<<<Thus it was decided that a cruise speed of MO.70 be adopted.>>>
<<<This relatively slow speed has the advantage of reducing the required wing sweep required which consequently will improve the take-off/landing performance of the aircraft.>>>
<<<High- speed cruise altitudes are also listed in Table 16.3 (taken from Data A).>>>
<<<The cruise altitude varies between 25 000 and 29000 ft. Higher cruise altitudes are more desirable to improve lift/drag ratio and reduce engine specific fuel consumption.>>>

<<<If this time could be reduced, higher cruise altitudes may be more feasible.>>>
<<<On this basis an initial cruise altitude of 35 OOOft was set with a time to climb to cruise altitude of less than 24 minutes.>>>
<<<The field length is an important requirement for the design.>>>
<<<If the field length requirement is too short the design will incur significant cost penalties.>>>
<<<Too great a length, however, and the aircraft will be unable to operate from certain airfields reducing its market potential.>>>
<<<Using field length information from Data C, cumulative percentage vs field length was plotted in Fig.>>>
<<<16.1 for UK, French and German airports.>>>
<<<The 50th percentile corresponds to a field length of around 2100 m (6890 ft).>>>
<<<Thus designing for this field would provide access to only half of the airports.>>>
<<<Reducing the field length to 1800 m (5900 ft) increases the available airports to 70%.>>>
<<<Reducing the field length further produces a small gain in the number of airports but at an increase in aircraft cost.>>>
<<<This approach is quite broad-based and thus it is useful to narrow down the number of airports to those identified during the stage length exercise.>>>

<<<This may be broken into three areas: 1. initial estimates 2. geometric sizing 3. optimisation of baseline design Analysis of existing aircraft Before the new design can be sized it is useful to analyse existing aircraft of a similar specification to determine key parameters such as operating empty mass (MOE) ratio and lift/drag ratio.>>>
<<<These parameters are then used together with the payload/range specification to determine an estimate for the aircraft maximum takeoff mass (MTOM).>>>
<<<From this information the wing and tail surfaces may be sized.>>>
<<<The performance estimates which lead to the definition of powerplant size can then be made.>>>
<<<A key indicator of a design's structural efficiency is the empty weight ratio (i.e.>>>
<<<the operating empty weight divided by the maximum take-off weight).>>>
<<<In general, the empty weight ratio decreases with increasing take-off weight, mainly due to the fact that larger aircraft fly over greater ranges and hence have a higher fuel weight Operating empty weight ratios are listed for civil jet transport aircraft in Data A.>>>
<<<Inspection of the data shows that the values vary from just over 0.60 for short-haul aircraft to around 0.45 for large, long-range aircraft.>>>
<<<Values for the empty weight ratio for the regional aircraft mentioned previously are plotted in Fig.>>>
<<<16.2.>>>
<<<Lines are shown connecting developed or stretched versions of the basic aircraft.>>>
<<<It is clear from the data that the basic model has the highest operating empty weight ratio and that this reduces as the aircraft is stretched.>>>
<<<Conversely 'shrinking' (e.g.>>>

<<<For existing aircraft information on cruise speed, fuel mass, payload and engine specific fuel consumption (SFC) are available and this enables lift/drag ratio to be estimated.>>>

<<<These are plotted in Fig.>>>
<<<16.3 against aircraft wing loading.>>>
<<<High wing loadings tend to increase aircraft lift/drag ratio but a smaller wing will increase take-off and approach speeds and thus have a detrimental effect on field performance.>>>
<<<The RJ series have significantly higher lift/drag ratios compared to other aircraft.>>>
<<<This may be partly due to the high- wing configuration and its associated drag and lift benefits.>>>
<<<Initial estimates Once the specification is complete and the preliminary analysis of similar aircraft has been conducted, it is possible to estimate the maximum take-off mass of the design and proceed to define the aircraft geometry.>>>
<<<Based on the empty weight ratio analysis, a reasonable value for our aircraft is 0.60.>>>
<<<From the lift/drag ratio estimates an initial value of 12.5 seems appropriate for a low-wing configuration.>>>
<<<These figures are now used with the specification to estimate the fuel mass and then the overall aircraft mass.>>>
<<<The Breguet Range equation is used to estimate the fuel mass ratio for the design.>>>
<<<The cruise speed is determined by first calculating the speed of sound for the required altitude.>>>
<<<This may be done using ISA atmospheric properties, or by reference to Data D. At 35000 ft, the speed of sound is 296.5 ms l giving a cruise of speed of 207.6 ms"1 (404 knots).>>>
<<<The ESAR may be estimated using the expression presented in Chapter 11: ESAR = 1.063 x 1250 + 568 = 1897 nm Engine data for the BPR 3.0 engine listed in Chapter 9 (Fig.>>>

<<<The spreadsheet method allows us to quickly illustrate the sensitivity of the design to payload/range changes as shown in Table 16.5.>>>
<<<Once the maximum take-off weight has been calculated, the wing area and engine thrust can be estimated.>>>
<<<Again, little information is available at this point, so a comparison with existing regional aircraft is made.>>>

<<<At this stage, any of the three cases can be used to size the engine.>>>
<<<However, the simplest option is often to estimate the thrust required at the top of climb.>>>
<<<This calculation requires an estimate for the aerodynamic drag polar which in general form is: CD = CDo + kCh where: CDo = profile drag coefficient k = induced drag coefficient (see below) CL = lift coefficient The profile drag coefficient, CDo typically varies between 0.013 and 0.024 for civil transport aircraft.>>>
<<<Lower values are associated with large, long-range aircraft with relatively small wings and high-wing loadings.>>>
<<<Higher values tend to be associated with short-haul aircraft with relatively large wings and low-wing loadings.>>>
<<<Based on this knowledge a value of CDo = 0.022 will be assumed for this exercise.>>>
<<<The induced drag coefficient, fc, may be expressed as: t = 1 n(AR)e where: AR = wing aspect ratio e = Oswald's efficiency factor The Oswald's efficiency factor typically varies between 0.75 and 0.85 for civil transport aircraft.>>>
<<<Higher values are associated with more modern aircraft with advanced wing sections.>>>
<<<Lower values relate to first and second generation civil jet transport aircraft.>>>
<<<We will assume an aspect ratio, AR of 9.0 for the initial estimates.>>>
<<<It would be possible to conduct a parametric optimisation later in the design process to determine the 'best' value for aspect ratio.>>>
<<<Using the method presented in Chapter 8 with an aspect ratio of 9.0 and a nominal taper ratio of 0.25 gives: C1 = 1.01 C2 = 1.02 The lift-dependent drag coefficient can now be computed as: dC, = /1.01 x 1.02 dC2 L V n x 9.0 0 0 0 ( ) 4 Q J 5 x \ = Q Q 4 4 / This corresponds to an Oswald's efficiency value of 0.798.>>>
<<<The drag polar for the clean configuration is thus: CD = 0.022 + 0.044Cj: The lift coefficient at the initial cruise altitude, assuming 2% fuel burnt during climb, is: The total drag coefficient is given by: The drag is then calculated as: At the initial cruise altitude a climb rate of 300ft/min (1.524 ms"1) is normally required for civil airline operations.>>>
<<<The climb angle associated with this rate is: The thrust required, T, is then calculated using: The thrust must now be converted to a sea-level static value using the BPR 3.0 engine data from Chapter 9 [Figs 9.18(a-f)].>>>
<<<The thrust available at 35000 ft and Mach 0.7 will be somewhat less than the maximum value at sea-level static conditions.>>>
<<<This reduction in thrust with increasing aircraft speed and altitude is normally termed thrust lapse.>>>
<<<Engine lapse rate is defined as the ratio of thrust at a given aircraft speed and altitude to that at sea-level static.>>>
<<<For this engine the lapse rate is approximately 0.25.>>>
<<<Therefore the equivalent sea-level static thrust is 97 391N.>>>
<<<Assuming two engines, each engine must provide 48 696 N (109451b) of thrust at sea-level static thrust setting.>>>
<<<The corresponding thrust/weight ratio is 0.280 which is slightly lower than that of the Fokker 70 at 0.341.>>>
<<<Once initial estimates have been made for the aircraft maximum take-off weight, wing area and thrust required, the geometry can be defined for the baseline aircraft.>>>
<<<Configuration Before detailed sizing of the aircraft is initiated, the aircraft configuration must be determined.>>>
<<<It is useful to consider a wide range of configurations and then assess each for its strengths and weaknesses.>>>
<<<It is likely that no single configuration Fig.>>>
<<<16.4 Alternative configurations for baseline design.>>>
<<<is a clear favourite.>>>
<<<In this case two configurations will be assessed through the preliminary design phase before a final decision is made.>>>
<<<The two configurations: are (a) wing-mounted engines and (b) rear-fuselage-mounted engines.>>>
<<<The former configuration is used for a number of larger aircraft but the smallest example is the Boeing 737.>>>
<<<In contrast rear-fuselage-mounted engines have been used on a number of short-haul regional aircraft including the Douglas DC9, Fokker F.28 and F. 100, Caravelle and BACl-Il.>>>
<<<For comparison the Boeing 737 and Douglas DC9 configurations are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<16.4.>>>
<<<Analysis conducted during the project suggested that the wing-mounted engines configuration is slightly lighter but suffers from inferior take-off performance due to the trailing edge flap discontinuity.>>>
<<<Concerns over foreign object ingestion and the ability to use larger powerplants on stretch variants with wing-mounted engines suggested that the rear-fuselage option was a better choice.>>>
<<<This also provides benefits such as a quieter cabin environment.>>>
<<<Fuselage The fuselage design is centered around the choice of fuselage cross-section.>>>
<<<This defines the seating layout, length of the aircraft and the ability to stretch the aircraft.>>>
<<<Seating layouts for regional aircraft vary between four, five and six abreast.>>>
<<<Too few seats across and the aircraft will have a high finesse ratio possibly incurring a weight penalty.>>>
<<<The aircraft will also be difficult to stretch as the fuselage finesse ratio will become even higher and the cabin interior seem too 'tube' like.>>>

<<<The aircraft can, however, be stretched easily.>>>
<<<The fuselage cross-section characteristics of several regional aircraft are shown in Table 16.6.>>>
<<<For the largest regional jets six abreast seating is standard with a fuselage diameter of around 3.70 m. The Avro RJ series has a diameter of 3.56 m somewhere between the typical five or six abreast fuselage diameter.>>>
<<<This provides a generous five abreast layout, but a rather cramped six abreast layout.>>>
<<<Noting that a slightly larger diameter would provide a more generous five abreast cabin, similar to that found on wide-body aircraft with the alternative for six abreast seating, a decision was made to use a 3.76m fuselage diameter.>>>
<<<Cross-sections for five and six abreast seating are shown in Fig.>>>
<<<16.5.>>>
<<<Once the cross-section has been chosen the next step is to generate the seating layout and fuselage planform.>>>
<<<For short-haul aircraft it is common to offer only two seating classes (business and economy).>>>

<<<The final layout is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<16.6.>>>
<<<Wing From the initial estimates two wing parameters have been defined for the wing: gross area and aspect ratio.>>>
<<<Before the external wing shape can finalised, the wing taper ratio and quarter chord sweep angle are required.>>>
<<<A lower taper ratio will tend to reduce wing mass and increase induced drag (Oswald's efficiency decreases).>>>
<<<It is also important to check that there is adequate chord near the tip for the placement of control surfaces.>>>
<<<An initial value may be determined from existing aircraft.>>>
<<<Values are seen to vary between 0.196 and 0.356.>>>
<<<A sensible value is 0.25 which may be adjusted by optimisation studies later in the design process.>>>
<<<The quarter chord sweep angle must be chosen in conjunction with the wing thickness /chord ratio.>>>
<<<Typically wing thickness/chord ratio is expressed for both the wing root and tip.>>>
<<<A rough estimate of the mean chord from Chapter 6 is: ft\ W m _(t/c)T + 3-(t/c\ 4 An initial estimate for the root and tip thickness /chord ratios is 0.15 and 0.12.>>>
<<<Using the above equation the average thickness/chord ratio is 0.1275.>>>

<<<The horizontal tail-volume coefficient varies between 0.707 and 1.432.>>>
<<<This parameter is dependent on the tail arm and hence the tail-volume coefficient increases as an aircraft is stretched.>>>
<<<Thus the baseline design is the most critical in terms of horizontal tail sizing.>>>
<<<At this stage the horizontal tail arm is not known, so the initial estimate will be based on area ratio.>>>
<<<For the baseline design a value of 0.20 is chosen giving a horizontal tail gross area of 15.0 m2.>>>

<<<Using the method described in Chapter 8 the aircraft drag polar for the take-off configuration with undercarriage up is: CDo= 0.042 + 0.044C| To this must be added the drag of the windmilling engine and that due to control surface deflection during flight with asymmetric power.>>>
<<<A first estimate of engine windmill drag may be obtained from: AC = ^ where Af is the fan cross-sectional area and S is the wing reference area.>>>
<<<For our regional jet, i f = 1.4m2.>>>

<<<The static thrust of the remaining engine is 44.34 kN.>>>
<<<This gives a net thrust of 36.74 kN.>>>
<<<At the reference climb speed of 121.4 kt, the lift coefficient is 1.56 producing a total drag coefficient of 0.1568 and a drag force of 28.09 kN.>>>

<<<Optimisation Three parameters were individually investigated for optimisation allowing the engine size to vary: • wing area • aspect ratio • minimum DOC Since both the take-off, landing and second-segment climb requirements were comfortably met, the wing area was analysed to investigate whether the top of climb thrust requirements could be reduced, allowing engine size also to be reduced.>>>

<<<16.7 Optimum wing area.>>>
<<<Gross wing area (m2) The minimum cruise power setting is seen to occur for a wing area of approximately 67 m2, compared with the baseline figure of 75 m2.>>>
<<<However, since there is a requirement for growth from the basic design it is desirable to 'over-wing' the initial aircraft.>>>
<<<On this basis a wing area of 70 m2 was chosen in consideration of the small penalty in thrust that will be incurred.>>>
<<<The wing aspect ratio and direct operating cost (DOC) are closely related.>>>
<<<Increasing aspect ratio tends to reduce cruise drag, increase cruise lift/drag ratio and reduce the amount of fuel required.>>>
<<<This will reduce DOC per aircraft seat mile.>>>
<<<However, if aspect ratio is increased further, the increased structural mass of the wing will offset the fuel savings and the DOC per ASM will increase.>>>
<<<Determining the optimum value is complex as results are dependent on assumptions used in the DOC calculation, particularly the cost of fuel.>>>
<<<This is further complicated by the fact that the aircraft will not typically enter service until around five years after the conceptual design phase and then may stay in production for 20 years.>>>
<<<The analysis must consider the sensitivity of results to changes in fuel price in the future.>>>
<<<In this scenario fuel prices may increase with introduction of a 'carbon tax', so the baseline fuel price was set at a typical present day value of $0.50 per US gallon.>>>
<<<To assess the sensitivity of this assumption DOC per ASM was then estimated as a function of aspect ratio for fuel prices of $0.50, $1.00, $1.50 and $2.00 per US gallon as shown in Fig.>>>
<<<16.8.>>>
<<<For present fuel prices the aspect ratio for minimum DOC is approximately 8.0 (similar to the value used on current regional transport aircraft).>>>
<<<Increasing the fuel price to $1.00 per US gallon increases the optimum aspect ratio to 11.00.>>>
<<<Increasing the fuel price further increases the optimum aspect ratio to around 12.>>>
<<<The highest value ever used on a swept wing jet transport aircraft is 10.0 on the Airbus A330/340 series.>>>
<<<Values around 12.0 create structural and aeroelasticity problems that may not be solved with current materials (aluminium alloys).>>>

<<<The final design exhibits an operating empty weight ratio of 0.599, the slight increase compared with the baseline design being attributable to the higher wing aspect ratio of the final design.>>>
<<<Lift/drag ratio is increased to 14.76 with a cruise altitude of 35 000 ft. Time to climb to cruise altitude The time required to climb to the initial cruise altitude of 35 000 ft was calculated using a simplified approach.>>>
<<<Since ambient conditions, true airspeed and engine thrust vary with altitude, the climb phase was broken down into a series of segments.>>>
<<<The conditions at the mid-point of each segment were then used to compute the climb gradient and the time to climb through the segment.>>>
<<<The total time is then obtained by summing the time taken for each segment.>>>
<<<The results from the spreadsheet are shown in Table 16.14.>>>
<<<The results show that the final design just achieves the specification to reach the initial cruise in under 25 minutes.>>>
<<<In view of this an alternative cruise option was analysed with a cruise altitude of 31 000 ft.>>>
<<<This reduces the time to climb to 18.5 minutes, but the cruise lift/drag ratio decreases to 13.62, reducing the design range by 107 nm to 1143 nm.>>>

<<<Military transport aircraft Summary The choice of a military aircraft design study in a book devoted to civil aircraft design may seem strange but it has been included to illustrate how the methods described in the book can be applied, with care, to other types of aircraft.>>>
<<<The military transport aircraft provides a good example of how the payload and operational the overall configuration of the aircraft.>>>
<<<requirements sometimes dictate This study was undertaken in 1993 by two undergraduate students.>>>
<<<At about the same time, the McDonnell-Douglas C-17 was undergoing trials with the USAF as a supplemental airlifter to the ageing fleet of Lockheed C-5 Galaxy airlifters.>>>
<<<The C-17 was designed to transport out-size loads direct to front line battle zones using semi-prepared airstrips around 3000 ft (1500 m) long.>>>
<<<This requirement led to several compromises being made during the design in order to attain the required performance.>>>
<<<These compromises were mainly associated with the restricted capacity that could be carried (both weight and volume) and the reduced range.>>>
<<<In contrast, the C-5 Galaxy requires a 10000 ft (3000 m) paved runway when operating with a full payload.>>>
<<<This study illustrates the process of setting the initial design specification with particular reference to the operational requirements.>>>
<<<The design process is followed through from the initial estimates to detailed trade-off studies.>>>
<<<Introduction The Gulf War in 1991 highlighted the need for heavy airlifters to transport artillery, vehicles, helicopters and supplies to areas quickly and efficiently.>>>
<<<Such was the shortfall in airlifter capacity that civil reserve aircraft were called upon to assist the USAF fleet of Galaxy and Starlifter aircraft.>>>
<<<These aircraft were generally freighter versions of large civil transport aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Douglas DC-10.>>>
<<<These aircraft exhibited good payload/range characteristics, but the height of the main deck meant that only palletised cargo could be accommodated.>>>
<<<In response to this deficiency, the USAF has since requested that additional military airlifters be procured.>>>
<<<With the rising costs of the C-17 program, a restart of C-5 Galaxy production was even proposed.>>>
<<<The Galaxy was originally designed in the late 1960s and combines dated aerodynamic technology with second generation turbofan engines.>>>
<<<Since this aircraft was designed the Soviet Union has developed two military airlifters which substantially outperform the ageing Galaxy aircraft.>>>
<<<In response to the need for additional airlifters, this study represents the conceptual design of a new military airlifter.>>>
<<<It is anticipated that the introduction of super-critical wing technology and advanced third generation turbofan engines developed for civil transport applications will significantly improve performance and reduce costs compared with the existing C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft.>>>
<<<Specification The specification for a military airlifter may appear to be similar to that of a civil transport aircraft, including parameters such as design payload, design range, etc.>>>
<<<However, the method by which some of these parameters, specifically the design payload, are determined is very different.>>>
<<<For a civil transport aircraft, the payload is primarily passengers which are regularly arranged in a fuselage, often of cylindrical cross-section to minimise weight, whereas the payload for a military airlifter varies in both shape and weight.>>>
<<<Items such as helicopters are relatively light, yet require a large volume of space in the hold.>>>
<<<This can lead to 'bulking-out' of the cargo hold where the volumetric space has been used, yet the payload is far below the maximum that can be carried by the aircraft.>>>
<<<This occurred frequently with the C-141A Starlifter and led to the development of the stretched version (C-141 B) with a substantially increased hold volume.>>>
<<<Another loading difficulty can occur with very dense items, such as tanks and artillery vehicles.>>>
<<<These often have very high floor loadings (often expressed as kg/ m2 of contact area) and this requires strengthened floors.>>>
<<<The C-17 achieves this with minimum weight penalty by strengthening the floor ramps between the three strengthened fuselage frames that take the main wing spar connections and undercarriage attachment points.>>>
<<<This configuration, however, limits the carriage of heavy items to the centre of the aircraft, disrupting the length of the cargo hold available for other items.>>>
<<<This position helps to maintain an adequate centre of gravity position for the aircraft.>>>
<<<As a replacement for the C-5 Galaxy it would be expected to carry several heavy items at once leaving lighter items to the C-17 and C-141.>>>
<<<Although the C-17 is a relatively new design, the performance requirements placed constraints on the size of the hold such that it cannot accommodate many items in the US inventory.>>>
<<<The other US airlifters were designed in the 1960s when many items now in the US inventory did not exist.>>>
<<<Some of these items are too bulky to be carried by even the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<Also, it must be remembered, particularly after the Gulf War, that rapid reaction forces may require deployment of outsize items from other NATO/Coalition forces as well as from the US inventory.>>>
<<<This rapidly expands the possible options that must be considered in sizing the fuselage for the aircraft.>>>
<<<The requirement to carry heavy wheeled /tracked items, implies a high-wing configuration, so that vehicles may be driven on/off the main cargo deck.>>>
<<<This requires a large rear cargo door to enable quick loading/unloading of cargo with minimum ground support.>>>
<<<Special consideration must be given to the provision of a hinged nose door to facilitate simultaneous loading and unloading of cargo (as provided on the C-5 and An-124 aircraft).>>>
<<<Design payload To aid in the determination of the design payload and the cargo hold shape, data is required on the possible types of vehicles that are in the US and NATO forces inventory.>>>
<<<Table 17.1 shows a summary of the data collated with key types listed for each sub-category.>>>
<<<After some consideration, the design payload was set at 150000 kg.>>>
<<<This gives enhanced capability compared with the C-5 Galaxy and enables the carriage of a greater number of medium to heavy items.>>>
<<<In comparison with current military aircraft typical design range appears to be in the range 2400-3400 nm (Table 17.2).>>>
<<<In general, the older aircraft have shorter ranges, with the exception of the An-225 whose low range is possibly attributable to the carriage of external cargo.>>>
<<<A design range of 3300 nm was selected.>>>
<<<The design range may be extended with the use of in-flight refuelling.>>>
<<<However, this is expensive and will lead to some loss of flexibility if tanker support is required on a regular basis.>>>
<<<The cruise performance of military airlifters has often been inferior to that of civil transport aircraft of comparable technology due to the higher drag configuration and the requirement for good field performance.>>>
<<<Better field performance normally demands a large wing area which directly affects the cruise performance.>>>
<<<However, with improvements in the drag reduction of wing high-lift aerodynamics and the use of super-critical wing technology it should be possible to offer similar cruise performance to that of civil transport aircraft.>>>
<<<This will also make the aircraft more compatible with operations on civil air-traffic routes.>>>
<<<In view of this, the cruise speed was set at Mach 0.80 with an initial cruise altitude of 33 000 ft.>>>
<<<Finally the field performance must be specified.>>>
<<<For a conventional civil transport aircraft, this is normally defined as a single distance for both take-off and landing.>>>
<<<However, the operation of a military airlifter is quite different.>>>
<<<A typical mission may be to take-off at maximum weight from a relatively long paved runway and land at a short semi-prepared strip and then return unloaded.>>>
<<<This mission implies a landing field length much shorter than that for take-off.>>>
<<<Based on this mission requirement, the take-off distance was set at 2000 m (6560 ft) with a landing field length of 1250 m (4100 ft).>>>

<<<As mentioned earlier the actual dimensions required are dictated by the equipment and materials that are to be transported.>>>
<<<During the definition of the specification, reference was made to the possible items that might be air-lifted to provide rapid deployment.>>>
<<<The geometry of such items is now considered for sizing of the cargo hold.>>>
<<<To aid this process a 50 m by 8 m grid was drawn representing the possible cargo hold.>>>
<<<Onto this grid the silhouettes of various items can be positioned to determine the number of items that can be transported and the volume/mass used.>>>
<<<This model was used to evaluate possible payload combinations and at the same time provide a graphical representation of the physical size of such combinations in terms of length, width, height and total weight.>>>
<<<It is worth noting that the cargo cross-sections of current military transports are not rectangular.>>>
<<<Key dimensions are the fuselage floor width and the maximum height.>>>
<<<To ensure that the cargo hold does not 'bulk out' when low density items are carried sufficient height and width must be used to provide the appropriate volume without an unacceptably long cargo hold.>>>
<<<After consideration of several payload combinations the following (length, width, height) cargo hold dimensions were chosen to be: 45.0m (147.7ft) x 5.9m (19.3ft) x 4.2m (13.8ft) These dimensions are greater than those of the C-5 Galaxy and enable this aircraft to carry the widest range of items within the US and NATO inventories.>>>
<<<It is important to note that the total length of the cargo hold includes the rear-loading ramp which is designed to be load bearing and forms part of the cargo volume.>>>
<<<This is similar practice to that used on the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft.>>>
<<<These dimensions are now used to determine the overall fuselage layout and size.>>>
<<<Fuselage layout A major requirement for any military transport aircraft is that of being able to load and unload any possible payload quickly, preferably with little or no extra handling systems to those available on the aircraft.>>>
<<<An obvious necessity is to have the floor of the cargo hold as close to the ground as possible.>>>
<<<This is achieved through choice of wing position and undercarriage design.>>>
<<<A high-wing with undercarriage-mounted to the fuselage sides will, in general, provide the best solution.>>>
<<<An examination of the airlifters listed in Table 17.2 shows that they all adopt such a configuration.>>>
<<<To prevent the wing carry-through section from obstructing the cargo hold, it is positioned to pass above the cargo hold.>>>
<<<To provide an aerodynamic shape this is then blended with the fuselage to form an upper deck above the cargo hold.>>>
<<<This deck provides four abreast seating (shown in Fig.>>>
<<<17.1) in two sections, one forward and one aft of the wing carry-through sections.>>>
<<<The forward section may be used for crew rest quarters for long endurance flights.>>>
<<<This upper deck feature is also common to the C-5 Galaxy and the Antonov An-124 aircraft.>>>
<<<Cargo hold access is of particular importance.>>>
<<<Most civil freighters use side cargo doors which are not suitable for use on military transport aircraft.>>>
<<<Access is provided through longitudinal loading using the nose and/or rear.>>>
<<<All the existing aircraft provide rear-loading ability.>>>
<<<The larger aircraft all have Fig.>>>
<<<17.1 Fuselage and cargo hold cross-section.>>>
<<<nose-loading providing simultaneous loading/unloading capability.>>>
<<<This may be an issue, particularly close to the front-line where it is desirable to expose the aircraft to threat for the shortest possible time.>>>
<<<Both nose and rear access produce weight penalties in terms of fuselage mass.>>>
<<<For initial design estimates this may be included in the design calculations by increments added to the basic fuselage mass estimated using the methods of Chapter 7.>>>
<<<Typical values for rear-loading ramps are 7-9% of fuselage mass.>>>
<<<Nose-loading might be expected to incur a slightly lower penalty of 6-8%.>>>
<<<More precise values can only be refined using detailed analysis once the specific geometry and loads are known.>>>
<<<For this aircraft the provision of an upper deck and high level flight deck lends itself to nose-loading, similar to that on the C-5 Galaxy, An-124 and freighter variants of the Boeing 747.>>>
<<<It is then questionable whether a rear-loading ramp is necessary.>>>
<<<This feature, however, allows the air-drop of certain cargo and troops.>>>
<<<This was a design requirement for the C-17 Globemaster.>>>
<<<With the basic fuselage configuration determined and the cargo hold dimensions known, the external fuselage size can be set out through the development of engineering drawings and comparisons to existing military transport aircraft.>>>
<<<For our design the overall fuselage dimensions are: length: maximum width: maximum height: 70.0 m (229.7 ft) 7.3 m (23.9 ft) 7.5 m (24.6 ft) Initial estimates To determine an initial estimate of the maximum take-off mass, values are required for the operating empty mass ratio and the fuel mass ratio for the design mission.>>>
<<<For an initial value of the operating empty mass ratio comparison was made with existing aircraft.>>>
<<<For the aircraft listed in Table 17.2, the computed values (not shown) range from 0.423 to 0.463 with a mean value of 0.435.>>>
<<<Little variation is observed with aircraft size in contrast to that shown for regional aircraft in Chapter 16.>>>
<<<The fuel mass ratio is estimated using the rearranged Breguet Range equation shown below: Mj0 Using the chart and expression provided in Chapter 10 for a design range of 3300 nm, the equivalent still air range is found to be approximately 4050 nm.>>>
<<<It is anticipated that the aircraft will need a 640001b (285.7 kN) class high bypass ratio turbofan engine such as the Trent 700 series.>>>
<<<Cruise SFC for this engine is approximately 0.553 lb/hr/lb.>>>
<<<For the baseline design an initial cruise altitude of 10 000 m (33 000 ft) and cruise speed of Mach 0.80 were chosen.>>>
<<<This corresponds to a cruise speed of 239.6 ms"1 (465.7 kt).>>>

<<<The Boeing 747 L/D ratio is about 17 and this suggests that the C-5 Galaxy cruise L/D may be around 15.>>>
<<<Since more modern civil transports are now achieving L/D values of 18-20 it may be appropriate for the initial estimates to choose a lift/drag ratio of 17 since the configuration is not too dissimilar to civil aircraft.>>>
<<<Applying these values to the Breguet Range equation results in a fuel mass ratio of 0.2478.>>>
<<<With a design payload of 150000 kg, the initial estimate for the take-off mass is then: Mp 1 - 0.2478 - 0.435 TO = 472 833 kg This value is comparable to that of the Antonov An-124 (405 tonnes) which has similar payload capability but shorter range.>>>
<<<Take-off mass for various payload/range values is shown in Table 17.3.>>>
<<<A payload of 120 tonnes and 2500 nm range corresponds to the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<Note how the 330 tonnes estimate compares with the Galaxy take-off mass of 380 tonnes.>>>

<<<Take-off masses above 600 tonnes would probably require four engines, each with a static thrust in excess of 1000001b (454 kN) or alternatively six engines (the configuration used by Antonov for the An-225) if such large engines were not available.>>>
<<<Aircraft geometry With an initial estimate of the maximum take-off mass, the remaining aircraft geometry can be sized.>>>
<<<As for the regional jet in Chapter 16, this is principally done by comparison with existing aircraft in the first instance to complete the baseline design.>>>
<<<Parameters are then changed later in the process as a result of parametric analysis and trade studies.>>>
<<<The next parameter to be chosen is the wing loading.>>>
<<<This will determine the wing reference area and has an effect on the aerodynamics, performance and size of other airframe components.>>>
<<<Analysis of the transports listed in Table 17.2 shows that wing loadings vary between 450 and 750 kgm 2.>>>
<<<Higher values tend to be associated with more modern and larger transports without a rough/short field take-off requirement.>>>
<<<Based on this information a wing area of 700 m2 was chosen, corresponding to a wing loading of 672 m2.>>>
<<<Wing aspect ratio was chosen to be 8.0, typical of aircraft of this size.>>>
<<<Higher values will increase wing mass and also wing span which is an issue for large military transports where a shorter span is preferable to reduce congestion at military bases.>>>
<<<A parametric trade study can be done later in the design process to identify the sensitivity of aspect ratio on various design parameters (see later in this chapter).>>>
<<<A super-critical wing section was adopted for the aircraft as used on more recent aircraft.>>>
<<<This should substantially improve cruise performance relative to aircraft such as the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<For a cruise speed of Mach 0.8, Fig.>>>
<<<6.6 suggests that a quarter chord sweep angle of 30 is sufficient.>>>
<<<This compares with 35 for the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<The reduction in wing sweep is brought about through improved wing sectional aerodynamics, and this should reduce wing mass and improve high-lift device efficiency.>>>
<<<High-lift devices are critical to good field performance by military transport aircraft, although significant advances have been made in aerodynamics since the introduction of the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<The main benefits will be associated with the reduction of mass and drag, rather than increases in lift generation.>>>
<<<The aircraft is assumed to have full span leading edge slats and double-slotted Fowler flaps.>>>
<<<Based on the method presented in Chapter 8, maximum landing lift coefficient is estimated to be 3.05 and maximum take-off lift coefficient around 2.7.>>>
<<<The take-off value is quite high and will result in a low L/D ratio for second-segment climb.>>>
<<<This, however, should not present a problem for a four-engined transport which requires lower engine-out and second-segment climb capability.>>>
<<<A number of options are available for the tail layout.>>>
<<<The classical layout for military transport aircraft with rear-loading ramps is a T-tail configuration.>>>
<<<Recently, the An-124 demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate a low-set horizontal tail behind the rear-loading ramp.>>>
<<<McDonnell-Douglas studied both configurations for the C-17 and determined that a T-tail provides improved ride quality at low level in turbulence where a low-set tail position suffers since it is in the wake from the wing.>>>
<<<Based on this information a T-tail arrangement was chosen.>>>
<<<At the initial stages of the design process tail sizing is made on the basis of tail area ratio comparisons with existing aircraft.>>>
<<<Tail volume coefficients may be evaluated later in the process once the tail arm dimensions have been determined.>>>
<<<The horizontal tail area ratios are seen to vary between 0.117 and 0.167.>>>
<<<An initial estimate of area is made of 100m2 corresponding to a ratio of 0.143.>>>
<<<This is towards the lower limit of values but reflects the introduction of new technologies such as improved aerodynamics and relaxed static stability.>>>
<<<A similar strategy was taken for sizing the vertical tail.>>>
<<<Area ratios vary between 0.129 and 0.205, the low value corresponding to the C-141 and the higher value the C-17.>>>
<<<This may seem counter to the trends of technology, but is partly due to the short tail arm on the C-17.>>>
<<<Based on this data an area of 97.3 m2 was chosen corresponding to an area ratio of 0.139.>>>
<<<Once the configuration was complete the tail arms and volume coefficients were determined to further check the tail geometry.>>>
<<<To complete the layout four Trent 700 class high bypass ratio turbofan engines are mounted beneath the wing at relative spanwise positions of 0.266 and 0.50 respectively.>>>
<<<Static thrust for the baseline design was assumed to be 640001b (285.7 kN).>>>
<<<Spreadsheet model Design methods similar to those described in the preceding chapters were coded into a spreadsheet aircraft design model.>>>
<<<With some minor changes the model can be adapted from the one used for the regional aircraft of Chapter 16.>>>
<<<Using the model the baseline design was found to have a MTOW of 445.6 tonnes, somewhat lower than the initial prediction.>>>
<<<This reduction is mainly due to a higher than expected lift/drag ratio of 17.55.>>>
<<<The empty weight ratio is also slightly lower than expected (0.423), compared with the 0.435 value assumed for the initial estimate.>>>
<<<This slight reduction may be attributable to advances in propulsion technology and materials.>>>
<<<Aircraft performance analysis shows that equipped with 640001b (284.7 kN) turbofans the baseline design meets all the specification criteria.>>>
<<<Take-off field length is 1818 m and landing field length is 1060 m. Note these are unfactored distances which are normally quoted for military transport aircraft.>>>
<<<The second- segment climb gradient is 0.04 which comfortably meets the minimum requirement for four-engined aircraft of 0.03.>>>
<<<Sensitivity analysis shows that aspect ratio has a significant effect on the second-segment climb gradient.>>>
<<<Assuming other variables remain constant Table 17.4 illustrates the effect of changes in aspect ratio on second-segment climb gradient.>>>
<<<The effect is particularly powerful for this design because of the high lift coefficient assumed and hence the resulting high induced drag.>>>
<<<Reducing the take- off lift coefficient to 2.5 would increase the gradient from 0.027 to 0.033 for an aspect ratio of 7.0, but reduction in CL would, however, have a detrimental effect on take-off performance.>>>
<<<Undercarriage design Once a more accurate estimate of the maximum take-off mass has been achieved a more detailed analysis of the undercarriage may be made.>>>
<<<Although the mass estimation method presented in Chapter 7 does not require detailed information Table 17.4 Sensitivity of aspect ratio of second segment climb gradient Aspect ratio Net thrust (kN) Drag (N) Climb gradient 7.0 683 363 567 356 0.027 7.5 683 363 536297 0.034 8.0 683 363 509120 0.040 about the undercarriage configuration it is important for this class of aircraft to determine the number of wheels required and the tyre size for a given pavement loading.>>>
<<<Using the references provided in Chapter 3 tyre sizes and allowable loads may be used to select an appropriate tyre.>>>
<<<For this aircraft a large low pressure tyre was chosen with the following characteristics: = 1.63 m diameter: width: = 0.572 m inner diameter: = 0.66 m At a pressure of 901b/in2 (620kN/m2) the tyre can accept a maximum static load of approximately 25 000 kg.>>>
<<<For this load the pavement load classification number (LCN) is approximately 50.>>>
<<<This corresponds with an LCN of 44 for the C-5 Galaxy.>>>
<<<A simple configuration with 10 undercarriage struts (five per side) and two wheels per strut is assumed, similar to that used by Antonov for the An-124/225.>>>
<<<A check must now be made that 10 struts and 20 wheels provides an equivalent single wheel load (ESWL) below 25 000 kg.>>>
<<<Assuming, for simplicity, that the aircraft static load is applied to the main undercarriage as though it were a tricycle layout, approximately 8% of MTOW is applied to the nose gear and 92% of MTOW to the main gear.>>>
<<<Now dividing by 10 gives the total load per strut.>>>
<<<Using the final design MTOW, this gives a load per strut of 40 945 kg.>>>
<<<The ESWL must now be determined.>>>
<<<For a strut with two wheels or a bogie with four or more wheels this is not simply the strut load divided by the number of wheels.>>>
<<<This is because the wheels are relatively close together and so the ESWL will be higher.>>>
<<<For a twin-wheel strut the reduction factor is dependent on the spacing between the wheels.>>>
<<<The range is typically 1.65-1.8.>>>
<<<For this case the wheels are closely spaced to minimise the volume required when retracted into the fuselage sides and thus a lower value of 1.65 is used.>>>
<<<This produces an ESWL of 24 815 kg, just inside the allowable value of 25 000 kg.>>>
<<<If the allowable load had not been achieved, the spacing would need to be increased or, if this was not possible, a greater number of struts/wheels or a more capable tyre would be needed.>>>
<<<All these options would increase weight and drag.>>>
<<<This provides a classical trade-off scenario where, at the detailed design stage, the effect on aircraft mass of LCN limits can be determined.>>>
<<<Optimisation The baseline design whilst satisfying all design criteria is far from optimum.>>>
<<<Field and cruise performance both exceed specification with some margin.>>>
<<<This suggests that the efficiency of the design can be improved.>>>
<<<The margin on landing field length would allow the wing area to be reduced and this should improve cruise performance.>>>
<<<Table 17.5 shows a simple trade-off analysis on wing area for the baseline design.>>>
<<<Reducing wing area from the baseline value of 700 m2 reduces MTOW slightly but at the expense of a slight increase in cruise power setting.>>>
<<<Based on the above Table 17.5 Wing area trade-off study Gross wing area (m2) 660 680 700 710 MTOW (kg) 442654 443 979 445 384 446114 Cruise power setting (%) 100.26 99.95 99.71 99.62 L/D 17.35 17.46 17.55 17.60 W/S (kg/m2) 670.61 652.91 636.26 628.33 data, the wing area was reduced to 680 m2.>>>
<<<To help reduce cruise thrust, which is now the critical requirement for sizing the powerplant, a trade analysis was conducted for aspect ratio with the new wing area.>>>
<<<An increase in aspect ratio to 8.5 increases cruise L/D to 17.76 (from 17.46) and reduces the cruise power setting.>>>
<<<This enables engine static thrust to be reduced to 620001b (275.8 kN).>>>
<<<A small weight penalty is incurred increasing gross weight close to that of the baseline design.>>>

<<<Unconventional designs Summary Unconventional designs are often difficult to analyse using traditional design programs that are inflexible.>>>
<<<In contrast the modular layout of a spreadsheet aircraft design program and the rapid development time, allow the model to be tailored to the requirements of the unconventional design study.>>>
<<<This study was made possible due to the availability of a wing mass formula for multi-hull aircraft.>>>
<<<This was incorporated into the spreadsheet model developed for the regional airliner and updated for application to large, long-haul aircraft.>>>
<<<The revised model was first validated on large aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400 before being applied to three aircraft with different fuselage configurations.>>>
<<<Optimisation analysis demonstrates the structural benefits of distributing fuselage mass along the wing span.>>>
<<<The significance of aspect ratio in design optimisation is illustrated by determining the aspect ratio for minimum gross weight, minimum direct operating cost and minimum fuel weight for each of the three designs.>>>
<<<Introduction One of the limitations of some of the established aircraft design programs is the difficulty of assessing aircraft of widely different configurations from the conventional layouts on which the software was based.>>>
<<<Modifications often require substantial redesign, recoding, recompiling and debugging of the program.>>>
<<<With spreadsheet methods the analysis is structured for the particular problem under investigation; therefore the inflexibility of traditional programs is avoided.>>>
<<<This study was used to assess the difficulties associated with designing unconventional layouts using spreadsheet methods.>>>
<<<Some earlier work on ultra- high capacity civil transport aircraft had identified serious technical and operational problems associated with aircraft size.>>>
<<<To overcome some of these problems multi-hull layouts were investigated.>>>
<<<This offered the opportunity of assessing the flexibility of spreadsheet methods applied to unusual layouts.>>>
<<<Multi-hull aircraft have been considered in several aircraft projects in the past.1'2'3 The main advantage claimed for the configuration is the increased structural efficiency compared to conventional single-hull layouts.>>>
<<<This increase in structural efficiency results from the reduced wing bending moment due to the outboard position of the fuselage mass.>>>
<<<This in turn, produces a lighter wing and enables higher aspect ratios to be used.>>>
<<<There are, however, many problems surrounding the configuration which have resulted in the configuration rarely being adopted.>>>
<<<The most notable exception is the Voyager aircraft.4 The design point for the study was set at 1500 seats (i.e.>>>
<<<an ultra-ultra high capacity aircraft) in a three-class layout, flying 4000 nm with usual reserves at Mach 0.82 and operating from 3000 m runways.>>>
<<<The range is shorter than that proposed for the new large aircraft as it was felt that the payload/range trade-off would offer more flexibility than for conventional designs.>>>
<<<The multi-hull layout necessitated developing the wing mass formula within the overall mass model to account for the novel configuration.>>>
<<<The wing mass formula for twin fuselage aircraft developed by Udin et al.5 was used.>>>
<<<The method may be applied to single-, twin- and triple-hull aircraft configurations.>>>
<<<In the latter case the aircraft is modelled as a single fuselage aircraft with the two outer fuselages considered as concentrated loads.>>>
<<<In this way all three aircraft can be modelled using a consistent analytical method, enabling accurate comparisons to be made between configurations.>>>
<<<The implementation of the new wing mass formula confirmed that existing spreadsheet modules could be modified quickly.>>>
<<<Unlike traditional procedural languages, the spreadsheet code does not require recompiling after each alteration, and the formula may be debugged faster because all the calculated values in the spreadsheet are visible.>>>
<<<Since no multi-hull transport aircraft exist the spreadsheet was applied to aircraft designs proposed by Lockheed in its multi-body aircraft study6 to validate the analytical methods used.>>>
<<<Configuration Fuselage design was an area of specific interest.>>>
<<<Each design required a different fuselage cross-section to produce a near optimum fuselage shape.>>>
<<<To achieve this a range of fuselage cross-sections was analysed for all three configurations.>>>
<<<The single-fuselage design proved the most difficult since this requires 24-28 seats abreast to maintain acceptable fuselage length.>>>
<<<Such a number of seats immediately dictates a multi-deck aircraft.>>>
<<<The critical question here is either a twin-aisle triple-deck aircraft or a triple-aisle twin-deck configuration.>>>
<<<Neither of these options is likely to be viable in terms of passenger evacuation; however the twin-deck layout was chosen as being most representative for this class of aircraft.>>>
<<<After considering double bubble and ovoid designs a circular section was adopted as mechanically the simplest shape.>>>
<<<Figure 18.1 shows that the main deck has 14 seats arranged 3-4 4 3, whilst the upper deck has 12 seats in 2-4-4-2 configuration.>>>
<<<In terms of scale the upper deck floor width is the same as a Boeing 747 main deck.>>>
<<<The under floor cargo hold can accommodate three LD3 containers abreast.>>>
<<<For the number of seats abreast this represents a reduction in cargo hold Single fuselage Twin fuselage Fig.>>>
<<<18.1 Fuselage cross-sections.>>>
<<<Triple fuselage volume compared to current single-deck civil transport aircraft.>>>
<<<This will be a serious disadvantage to airline profitability potential.>>>
<<<The twin-fuselage design requires 750 passengers per fuselage.>>>
<<<The three-class layout was split equally between the fuselages.>>>
<<<The implications for passenger loading are not considered here.>>>
<<<Circular and double-bubble designs were analysed and the final choice is based on a double-bubble shape with flattened top and bottom.>>>
<<<The upper deck is 10 abreast in 3-4-3 configuration.>>>
<<<The main deck is 11 abreast with a 3-5-3 seating arrangement.>>>
<<<The underfloor cargo hold can accommodate three LD3 containers abreast.>>>
<<<This equates to 7pax/LD3 compared with 8.7pax/LD3 for the single-fuselage aircraft.>>>
<<<The twin-fuselage aircraft will, however, have two wing carry-through sections and cargo hold volume should be similar to that of the single-fuselage aircraft.>>>
<<<The triple-fuselage aircraft requires 500 passengers per fuselage.>>>
<<<Again the three-class layout has been split between the fuselages.>>>
<<<A number of cross-sections were analysed, yet it was concluded that the Boeing 747 cross-section with 3-3 seating on the upper deck and 3-4-3 seating on the lower would be suitable.>>>
<<<The under floor cargo contains two LD3 containers abreast.>>>
<<<The cross-section equates to 8pax/LD3, compared with 10pax/LD3 for the twin-fuselage design.>>>
<<<Statistical data of current large transport aircraft was then used to determine the baseline parameters for each of the configurations.>>>
<<<This included determination of wing loadings, tail volume coefficients, high-lift device type and capability, etc.>>>
<<<Engines were based around scaled variants of the Rolls Royce Trent 800 series which was well defined at the time this study was conducted.>>>
<<<Optimisation The aircraft were then optimised using spreadsheet methods.>>>
<<<Figure 18.2 (reproduced directly from the spreadsheet output) shows the variation of gross weight with aspect ratio for each of the designs.>>>
<<<The minimum gross weight for single-fuselage aircraft is seen to occur for an aspect ratio of 6.75.>>>
<<<This is very close to the values used on the first generation wide-body transports as shown in Table 18.1.>>>
<<<This illustrates two points.>>>
<<<First, it confirms that early wide-body transports were optimised around minimum gross weight.>>>
<<<This is mainly because computer power was not available for more advanced optimisation and also because lower fuel prices meant weight and initial aircraft cost were more important than direct operating cost.>>>
<<<Secondly, the approximate aspect ratio for minimum gross weight has not changed significantly despite the advances in propulsion, aerodynamics and structures.>>>
<<<It is quite likely that the value found is more closely related to the basic (single-fuselage) configuration.>>>

<<<For the aspect ratio range 6-12 it is at least 6% lighter than the single-fuselage configuration.>>>
<<<The aspect ratio for minimum gross weight is approximately 8.75, a considerable increase over the single-fuselage design due to the relief of wing load associated with the outboard location of the fuselages.>>>
<<<The triple-fuselage design does not move all the fuselage and payload mass outboard and so is not as efficient (structurally) as the twin-fuselage design.>>>
<<<It still, however, proves to be better than a single-fuselage design.>>>
<<<A reduction in gross weight of at least 5% is evident for a given aspect ratio relative to the single- fuselage design.>>>
<<<DOC optimisation The aspect ratio of the final designs was selected on the basis of DOC optimisations.>>>
<<<A selection of fuel prices were used to determine the optimum aspect ratio for each design and the sensitivity to changes in fuel price.>>>
<<<Figures 18.3(a)-(c) show the DOC as a function of aspect ratio for different fuel prices for the three aircraft configurations respectively.>>>
<<<For a given fuel price, optimum aspect ratios are higher for the twin- and triple-fuselage designs relative to the single-fuselage design.>>>
<<<In all cases the optimum aspect ratio is higher than that for minimum gross weight.>>>
<<<Optimising for minimum DOC is now common practice and a feature of modern designs such as the Boeing 777.>>>

<<<Economic analysis Summary This study investigates the effect of aircraft size on aircraft economics.>>>
<<<Two separate design specifications (300- and 600-seat aircraft) are taken through the conceptual design process and optimised to produce final designs.>>>
<<<Comparison on key parameters shows that the 600-seat aircraft is structurally more efficient than two 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Total fuel and gross mass are also seen to be lower compared to two 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Assuming equal production runs (1000 aircraft), the 600-seat design purchase cost is seen to be less expensive compared to two 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<However, if only half as many 600-seat aircraft are produced (500), the 600-seat design is seen to be more expensive.>>>
<<<Estimates show that for equal production runs (1000 aircraft), the 600-seat design direct operating cost (DOC) is seen to be 10.4% below that of the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<If only five hundred 600-seat aircraft are produced compared to one thousand 300-seat aircraft, then the DOC advantage for the 600-seat aircraft reduces slightly to 9.0%.>>>
<<<Introduction Having shown the ability of spreadsheet methods to handle conventional and unconventional layouts from a technical/engineering standpoint, this study investigates the use of such methods for economic/cost analysis.>>>
<<<Analysis of past aircraft shows that aircraft direct operating costs have decreased with increasing aircraft size.1 However, such aircraft have been designed at different technology levels making comparisons difficult.>>>
<<<In order to make fair comparisons between two designs, the technology level must be similar.>>>
<<<Two aircraft of different size (300- and 600-seat) were designed to a common mission specification and optimised for minimum direct operating cost.>>>
<<<The mission specification was based on the proposed new large aircraft (NLA) design.>>>
<<<• Single-class layout with 34-inch seat pitch.>>>
<<<A single-class layout was adopted to simplify the design of the fuselages and allow more accurate comparisons to be made.>>>
<<<• 7200 nm range with full passengers and baggage.>>>
<<<• 3000 m field length.>>>
<<<• Cruise at M0.82 to M0.85 with initial altitude of at least 31 000 ft.>>>
<<<The spreadsheet model that was developed for this study incorporates detailed aircraft cost and direct operating cost methods so that the effects of production run/rate could be investigated.>>>
<<<The cost model by J. Wayne Burns2 was used to estimate aircraft development and purchase costs.>>>
<<<Direct operating costs were estimated to European rules using Association of European Airlines (AEA) methods.3 Configuration Similar to the designs presented in Chapter 18, the fuselage layout is central to the initial design for this study.>>>
<<<As mentioned above, single-class seating arrange- ments were adopted.>>>
<<<Galley space and other amenities were then set according to AEA recommendations for long-haul aircraft.>>>
<<<300-seat design The fuselage design is highly dependent on the choice of cross-section.>>>
<<<Obviously for a given number of passengers the cabin will be longer if the number of seats across is reduced.>>>
<<<For a 300-seat aircraft, a cross-section incorporating 7, 8, 9 or 10 abreast seating is possible.>>>
<<<This will produce fuselages of different length which will also affect the carriage of baggage and cargo.>>>
<<<Within this variation the designer must be aware of operational issues such as cargo hold container sizes and passenger preferences, e.g.>>>
<<<to be seated no more than one seat from an aisle.>>>
<<<To assess the effects of seating layout, several fuselage designs were configured.>>>
<<<This enabled the effects of the fuselage on the overall design to be taken into account.>>>
<<<Table 19.1 shows the primary characteristics for four different fuselage cross- sections.>>>
<<<Fuselage length, wetted area and floor area all decrease with increasing number of seats abreast.>>>
<<<Cargo hold volume per passenger is also seen to decrease as the cross-section increases from eight to 10 abreast.>>>
<<<This is mainly attributable to the shorter fuselage and hence fewer LD3 containers may be accommodated.>>>
<<<Table 19.2 shows the effects of different fuselage configurations on the baseline designs.>>>
<<<The fuselage group mass is seen to decrease as the number of seats abreast is increased.>>>
<<<This is mainly due to the lower finesse ratio of the shorter fuselage along with the reduction in wetted area.>>>
<<<The higher drag associated with the shorter fuselage, however, offsets the reduction in fuselage mass.>>>
<<<This makes the total mass, cost and DOC greater for nine and 10 abreast configurations compared with the baseline eight abreast seating configuration.>>>
<<<Based on this analysis the eight abreast seating layout was adopted for the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Table 19.1 300-seat fuselage characteristics No.>>>

<<<Because of the poor cargo hold volume this configuration was not considered for further analysis.>>>

<<<Above 500 seats the option of a double-deck seating arrangement becomes attractive.>>>
<<<This prevents the fuselage from being unacceptably long whilst twin-aisle seating providing acceptable arrangement.>>>

<<<Floor area is seen to reduce for either single- or double-deck designs, although double-deck seating appears to offer much greater floor area per passenger than for single-deck seating arrangements.>>>
<<<This is actually the additional floor space required to allow for the curved fuselage sides on the upper deck.>>>
<<<This may be used for carry-on baggage but it does not necessarily imply increased passenger comfort.>>>
<<<Hold volume per passenger is significantly higher for the nine and 10 abreast seating arrangements compared with the eight abreast 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<However, the volume per passenger then drops dramatically for double-deck designs to around 0.25 m3 per passenger compared with 0.35 m3 per passenger for the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<This reduction is entirely due to the double-deck seating arrangement and may help to improve the direct operating cost per air seat mile.>>>
<<<This may be a disadvantage as airlines would like to use extra cargo space for passenger and crew rest accommodation.>>>
<<<Noting that the single-deck arrangements produce unacceptably long fuselages, the three twin-deck options were analysed using the baseline aircraft parameters.>>>
<<<Again fuselage group mass reduces for 16 and 19 abreast seating arrangements compared with the 14 abreast seating design.>>>
<<<This is shown in Table 19.4.>>>
<<<Further analysis shows that the 16 abreast seating arrangement produces the minimum gross weight and minimum cost design.>>>
<<<Based on the analysis, the 16 abreast seating arrangement was selected for the 600-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Optimisation The aircraft were optimised using DOC/ASM as an objective function to produce the final designs.>>>
<<<The effect of wing area and aspect ratio on DOC/ASM for the 300-seat aircraft is shown in Fig.>>>
<<<19.1 (three-dimensional plotting facilities are automatically available within the spreadsheet).>>>
<<<It can be seen that aspect ratio has a pronounced effect on the DOC/ASM.>>>
<<<The optimum aspect ratio for current fuel prices is seen to be around 9.0.>>>
<<<This is in agreement with current designs.>>>
<<<It can also be seen that a smaller wing improves the DOC/ASM, for a long-range aircraft, as expected.>>>
<<<The minimum wing area was set by fuel volume requirements.>>>
<<<The buffet boundary constraint was not considered at this initial project stage.>>>
<<<The 600-seat aircraft was optimised in a similar manner to the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<The optimum aspect ratio was found to be around 8.5 for this aircraft.>>>
<<<This is slightly lower than that for the 300-seat aircraft which may be due to the increased overall size of the aircraft.>>>

<<<The general arrangements of the final 300- and 600-seat aircraft are shown in Figs 19.2 and 19.3.>>>
<<<A comparison of the two designs is shown in Table 19.5.>>>
<<<The 600-seat design is seen to be structurally more efficient with a lower empty weight ratio than the 300- seat designs.>>>
<<<Cruise lift/drag ratio is slightly lower for the larger aircraft; however, mission fuel is slightly below that of two 300-seat aircraft resulting in a lower gross weight for the 600-seat aircraft relative to two 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Economic analysis For the initial economic analysis, the production volume and build rate were assumed to be similar for both aircraft.>>>
<<<However, if two 300-seat aircraft were to perform the role of a single 600-seat aircraft, the production of the 300-seat design would be double that of the 600-seat design.>>>
<<<Also, the 300-seat design would be sold in its original 300-seat market.>>>
<<<Based on these assumptions a production run of 500 at four per month was set for the 600-seat design and 1000 at eight per month for the 300-seat design.>>>
<<<Table 19.6 shows the results for both production scenarios.>>>
<<<Assuming the same production run and rate for both designs, the results, as expected, show the 600- seat design to be less expensive than two 300-seat designs.>>>
<<<This trend is reflected in a reduction in DOC/ASM.>>>
<<<The 600-seat aircraft shows a 7.4% saving in aircraft cost and a 10.4% saving in DOC/ASM.>>>
<<<For the second scenario, which reflects Fig.>>>
<<<19.2 General arrangement of 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<different production volumes and rates, the 600-seat aircraft is seen to be 9.0% more expensive than two 300-seat designs and the DOC/ASM advantage is reduced 4.3%.>>>
<<<The study has produced conceptual aircraft designs for two specifications differing only in passenger capacity.>>>
<<<The spreadsheet model has been used to determine the aircraft mass and drag characteristics along with performance estimates.>>>
<<<The two baseline designs have been optimised for wing area and aspect ratio to produce minimum DOC designs.>>>
<<<Optimum aspect ratio was found to be 9.0 and 8.5 for the 300-seat and 600-seat aircraft respectively, suggesting a reduction in optimum aspect ratio with increasing aircraft size.>>>
<<<Fig.>>>
<<<19.3 General arrangement of 600-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Structural efficiency of the 600-seat aircraft is also better than the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<The empty weight ratio is seen to be 0.464 compared with 0.467 for the 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<The economic analysis has shown that the 600-seat aircraft is superior in terms of aircraft acquisition cost and direct operating cost per passenger provided that the same number of each aircraft are made.>>>
<<<However, since the 600-seat aircraft market is smaller an alternative scenario shows that the 600-seat aircraft may be more expensive than two 300-seat aircraft.>>>
<<<Direct operating cost for the larger aircraft is still below that of the 300-seat aircraft illustrating the effects of aircraft size.>>>
<<<There are many issues not covered by this simple study.>>>
<<<These include the greater flexibility offered to airlines by the smaller aircraft with respect to matching traffic variations, the use of the smaller aircraft on less dense routes.>>>
