<<<1-2   1.3 A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE 787 FAMILY OF AIRPLANES The 787 Dreamliner is an efficient family of twin-engine airplanes with exceptional environmental performance and new passenger-pleasing features.>>>
<<<An international team of aerospace companies builds the 787, led by Boeing at its Everett facility near Seattle, WA and in North Charleston, SC.>>>
<<<787 Family The 787 family is designed for medium- to long-range flights.>>>
<<<In a typical dual-class configuration, the 787-8 can carry 242 passengers, the 787-9 can carry 290 passengers, and the 787-10 will carry 330 passengers.>>>
<<<787 Engines The 787 features new engines from General Electric and Rolls-Royce that represent nearly a two-generation jump in technology.>>>
<<<Cargo Handling The lower lobe cargo compartments can accommodate a variety of containers and pallets now in use.>>>
<<<Ground Servicing The 787 features a more-electric design and does not have a traditional pneumatic system.>>>
<<<The traditional pneumatic starters on the engines are replaced with a pair of gearbox- mounted main-engine starter/generators.>>>
<<<Cabin air conditioning and wing anti-ice systems are also electrically powered.>>>
<<<The remaining pneumatic system is for engine nacelle anti- ice.>>>
<<<The airplane has ground service connections compatible with existing ground service equipment, and no special equipment is necessary.>>>
<<<In case of an inoperable APU, engine starts may be accomplished via the airplane's external ground electrical connections.>>>

<<<For ease of presentation, these data have been determined from the theoretical limits imposed by the geometry of the aircraft, and where noted, provide for a normal allowance for tire slippage.>>>
<<<As such, they reflect the turning capability of the aircraft in favorable operating circumstances.>>>
<<<These data should be used only as guidelines for the method of determination of such parameters and for the maneuvering characteristics of this aircraft.>>>
<<<In the ground operating mode, varying airline practices may demand that more conservative turning procedures be adopted to avoid excessive tire wear and reduce possible maintenance problems.>>>
<<<Airline operating procedures will vary in the level of performance over a wide range of operating circumstances throughout the world.>>>
<<<Variations from standard aircraft operating patterns may be necessary to satisfy physical constraints within the maneuvering area, such as adverse grades, limited area, or high risk of jet blast damage.>>>
<<<For these reasons, ground maneuvering requirements should be coordinated with the using airlines prior to layout planning.>>>
<<<Section 4.2 presents turning radii for various nose gear steering angles.>>>
<<<Radii for the main and nose gears are measured from the turn center to the outside of the tire.>>>
<<<Section 4.3 shows data on minimum width of pavement required for 180° turn.>>>
<<<Section 4.4 provides pilot visibility data from the cockpit and the limits of ambinocular vision through the windows.>>>
<<<Ambinocular vision is defined as the total field of vision seen simultaneously by both eyes.>>>
<<<Section 4.5 shows approximate wheel paths for various runway and taxiway turn scenarios.>>>
<<<The pavement fillet geometries are based on the FAA’s Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5300- 13 (thru change 16).>>>
<<<They represent typical fillet geometries built at many airports worldwide.>>>
<<<ICAO and other civil aviation authorities publish many different fillet design methods.>>>
<<<Prior to determining the size of fillets, airports are advised to check with the airlines regarding the operating procedures and aircraft types they expect to use at the airport.>>>
<<<Further, given the cost of modifying fillets and the operational impact to ground movement and air traffic during construction, airports may want to design critical fillets for larger aircraft types to minimize future operational impacts.>>>
<<<Section 4.6 illustrates a typical runway holding bay configuration.>>>

<<<5-39  6.0 JET ENGINE WAKE AND NOISE DATA 6.1 JET ENGINE EXHAUST VELOCITIES AND TEMPERATURE This section shows exhaust velocity and temperature contours aft of the 787 airplane.>>>
<<<The contours were calculated from a standard computer analysis using three-dimensional viscous flow equations with mixing of primary, fan, and free-stream flow.>>>
<<<The presence of the ground plane is included in the calculations as well as engine tilt and toe-in.>>>
<<<Mixing of flows from the engines is also calculated.>>>
<<<The analysis does not include thermal buoyancy effects which tend to elevate the jet wake above the ground plane.>>>
<<<The buoyancy effects are considered to be small relative to the exhaust velocity and therefore are not included.>>>
<<<The graphs show jet wake velocity and temperature contours for representative engines.>>>
<<<The results are valid for sea level, static, standard day conditions.>>>
<<<The effect of wind on jet wakes is not included.>>>
<<<There is evidence to show that a downwind or an upwind component does not simply add or subtract from the jet wake velocity, but rather carries the whole envelope in the direction of the wind.>>>
<<<Crosswinds may carry the jet wake contour far to the side at large distances behind the airplane.>>>
<<<It should be understood, these exhaust velocity contours reflect steady-state, at maximum taxi weight, and not transient-state exhaust velocities.>>>
<<<A steady-state is achieved with the aircraft in a fixed location, engine running at a given thrust level and measured when the contours stop expanding and stabilize in size, which could take several seconds.>>>
<<<The steady-state condition, therefore, is conservative.>>>
<<<Contours shown also do not account for performance variables such as ambient temperature or field elevation.>>>
<<<For the terminal area environment, the transient-state is a more accurate representation of the actual exhaust contours when the aircraft is in motion and encountering static air with forward or turning movement, but it is very difficult to model on a consistent basis due to aircraft weight, weather conditions, the high degree of variability in terminal and apron configurations, and intensive numerical calculations.>>>
<<<If the contours presented here are overly restrictive for terminal operations, The Boeing Company recommends conducting an analysis of the actual exhaust contours experienced by the using aircraft at the airport.>>>

<<<The airport is a major element in the community's transportation system and, as such, is vital to its growth.>>>
<<<However, the airport must also be a good neighbor, and this can be accomplished only with proper planning.>>>
<<<Since aircraft noise extends beyond the boundaries of the airport, it is vital to consider the impact on surrounding communities.>>>
<<<Many means have been devised to provide the planner with a tool to estimate the impact of airport operations.>>>
<<<Too often they oversimplify noise to the point where the results become erroneous.>>>
<<<Noise is not a simple subject; therefore, there are no simple answers.>>>
<<<The cumulative noise contour is an effective tool.>>>
<<<However, care must be exercised to ensure that the contours, used correctly, estimate the noise resulting from aircraft operations conducted at an airport.>>>
<<<The size and shape of the single-event contours, which are inputs into the cumulative noise contours, are dependent upon numerous factors.>>>
<<<They include the following: 1.>>>
<<<Operational Factors a.>>>
<<<Aircraft Weight - Aircraft weight is dependent on distance to be traveled, en route winds, payload, and anticipated aircraft delay upon reaching the destination.>>>
<<<b.>>>
<<<Engine Power Settings - The rates of ascent and descent and the noise levels emitted at the source are influenced by the power setting used.>>>
<<<c. Airport Altitude - Higher airport altitude will affect engine performance and thus can influence noise.>>>
<<<2.>>>
<<<Atmospheric Conditions-Sound Propagation a.>>>
<<<Wind - With stronger headwinds, the aircraft can take off and climb more rapidly relative to the ground.>>>
<<<Also, winds can influence the distribution of noise in surrounding communities.>>>
<<<b.>>>
<<<Temperature and Relative Humidity - The absorption of noise in the atmosphere along the transmission path between the aircraft and the ground observer varies with both temperature and relative humidity.>>>
<<<3.>>>
<<<Surface Condition-Shielding, Extra Ground Attenuation (EGA) a. Terrain - If the ground slopes down after takeoff or up before landing, noise will be reduced since the aircraft will be at a higher altitude above ground.>>>
<<<Additionally, hills, shrubs, trees, and large buildings can act as sound buffers.>>>
<<<All these factors can alter the shape and size of the contours appreciably.>>>
<<<To demonstrate the effect of some of these factors, estimated noise level contours for two different REV O D6-58333 February 2023 Not Subject to EAR or ITAR.>>>

<<<Most aircraft operations are, of course, conducted at less than maximum design weights because average flight distances are much shorter than maximum aircraft range capability and average load factors are less than 100%.>>>
<<<Therefore, in developing cumulative contours for planning purposes, it is recommended that the airlines serving a particular city be contacted to provide operational information.>>>
<<<In addition, there are no universally accepted methods for developing aircraft noise contours or for relating the acceptability of specific zones to specific land uses.>>>
