scoot is not really cheap for a budget carrier if you are willing to top up a bit you may fly with a normal carrier and get food water entertainment ,LABEL_1
scoot could have just provided a video screen for entertainment probably the loneliest flight ever ,LABEL_0
i like the idea of taking out all the baked in costs and presenting them to the consumer to choose what they actually want i only fly like 3 hour domestic u s flights and do not need power data or entertainment ,LABEL_2
i once did a 13 5 hour flight from kl to london on low cost airline airasia and it was actually one of the most pleasant flights i have ever taken i have flown 225 times ,LABEL_2

electricity on the plane is not free it puts load on the electrical systems which in turn puts load on the generator which by virtual of being connected to the engines puts load on to which consumes fuel so no it is not free if it is provided free it will be charged in the ticket there will be the add issue of calculating fuel to load as it cost fuel to carry more fuel so ya it is not that simple ,LABEL_0
flew on tui uk 788 from uk to langkawi in malaysia in economy it looks like a bit more room with 300 passengers and food and drinks were included it is a long way but at least we had a cruise to look forward to ,LABEL_2
there was a low cost airline peoplexpress based in newark new jersey they started service april 30 1981 and merged with continental february 01 1987 they flew boeing 727 200 boeing 737 100 200 and 747 100 200 they flew the 747s to london gatwick and brussels and on transcontinental flights i flew them quite a bit they changed for onboard services fifty cents for sodas juice coffee tea peanuts brownies etc snack packs for dollar6 00 on transcontinental and international flights the snack packs were more substantial their 747s had first class they called 1st class premium service i believe they did show a movie on their 747 flights they charged dollar3 00 per checked baggage and carryon no charge,LABEL_1

we are flying scoot in a few months time from australia to singapore i read complaints online but most seem quite minor cost of water which does seem excessive also cost of charging devices food quality anyway it is a budget airline with good aircraft so i think we will survive ,LABEL_2

if you want a good budget airline business class you should try jetstar ,LABEL_1

that business class should be like renamed to premium economy but i am still ambiguous about this anyway it is really great service by scoot ,LABEL_2
superb tripreport  loved it felix,LABEL_2

what about a flight with azur air germany or with azur air russia they even offer a very old boeing 747 but azur air germany with their 767 300er from d sseldorf to punta cana for example would be also very cool for a tripreport ,LABEL_2
nice job felix ,LABEL_2

the interior of the scoot is really not that great even though his son is sq he does not have an elegant impression at all at least it is still better if the qg looks like the interior and cabin crew are still connected to the ga ,LABEL_0

right well one weighs 18 tons and the other weighs 220,LABEL_1
and someone already painted the sound it made under the windscreen,LABEL_1
i flew scoot on a couple short hops recently they are fine definitely a low cost carrier but not the lowest of cost carriers planes appeared pretty nice though one engine made a relatively concerning noise on spool up you are packed in there pretty tight which is a bit of a difference coming off a 16 5hr singapore air flight in premium economy but they give you some snacks if you booked through singapore air on a scoot flight would not mind flying them again would be interesting to be on a long haul flight as mine were all on a320s an hour or so ,LABEL_2
i like how they still chocked the single tire ,LABEL_2
waiting for it to be evolved ,LABEL_1
thought that this was a dumb move initially but on further thought i think it is a rly smart move by scoot to capitalise on the london bangkok fifth freedom route the singapore bangkok route is definitely going to be loss making,LABEL_2
yeah 3 3 3 there are about 30 business class seats 2 2 2 just got back from tianjin gotta say the 787 is pretty awesome cheap prices together with great service make for an excellent flight experience even though meals are expensive ,LABEL_2
here have this ,LABEL_1
