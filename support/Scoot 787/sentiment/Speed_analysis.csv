you and a lot of commenters here seem to quite like scoot for its no frills for the absolute lowest price approach however what always kept me from flying scoot is that it rarely turned out to be this incredible deal that some other commenters were lucky enough to get looking at a return ber sin itinerary for various dates this year scoot is always the cheapest with around 700euros but depending on the dates there are usually turkish or qatar airlines flights available for just 20euros 100euros more even if you do not care about any amenities this would be worth it just for the checked bag alone that is why to me it always seems like flying scoot would only ever be worth it if you are flying one way or if you need the absolute fastest connection between berlin athens to singapore ,LABEL_2

17 hours from singapore to new york on this airline will be brutal 3 hours is okay if flying regional,LABEL_1

flew from singapore to tokio at the beginning of feb this year with scoot the overall experience was ok but from singapore to tokio scoot osnt that much cheaper than e g singapore airlines next time i will consider them instead but as someone who flew quite a lot with scoot i can say especially on short to medium haul flights the experience is quite good for what you pay ,LABEL_2

such a shame about the mediore food you would expect better from a singaporean carrier of all things even a budget one especially as air asia really do a fantastic job i have flown on air asia and air asia x and their meals have always been fantastic value and something i actively look forward to when flying with them ,LABEL_2
