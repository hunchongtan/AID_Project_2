They told me that I bought the tickets online so they would not be responsible for my tickets at all. So why do they still sell tickets online??>>><<<Thank you very much for this wonderful video. We hope to dedicate a video in order to solve the problems that occur in many airlines in America, Canada, Europe and various countries, when a person is very advised and influences the person on his side. Here is the problem. The people who advise must pay the amount for two seats so that they do not crowd others. We are facing this problem. This problem must be solved In fact, all companies think only for the sake of money, not for the sake of human comfort, and this is what we see, and this is considered a big mistake, and planes that transport passengers must be well maintained for the safety of aviation and for the safety of society. Many accidents have occurred and the reason is a lack of maintenance, and this is considered very important. The danger of companies only thinking about how to collect money. They did not look at the safety of society. They did not look at the safety of the plane, especially the maintenance. Maintenance is important, especially the engines and all the equipment. During my trip in America, the flying was very not good in terms of food and in terms of cleanliness. An international law must be put in place in terms of cleanliness and in terms of treatment as well as maintenance. The plane is for the safety of people>>><<<can you do ZipAir>>><<<i saw some post on reddit complaining about this flight and how obnoxious and invasive samchui was>>><<<This is very hard job. 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮   😊😊😊😊😊😊😊  ❤❤❤❤❤❤>>><<<I want to go to SG but I&#39;m afraid to fly because of turbulent 😓😓>>><<<منتظرك انا وصلت يلا يمك يلا شكرا  <br> وصلت يمك انا يلا للبيت واناهلاا يلاوصلت <br> تاخرت يلاو يمكو صلت يمك yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanik>>><<<منتظرك انا وصلت يلا يمك يلا شكرا  <br> وصلت يمك انا يلا للبيت واناهلاا يلاوصلت <br> تاخرت يلاو يمكو صلت يمك yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanikيلا تمام نعم يلا ايي وينك انت يمك يلاوصلت <br>لي اترك وينك كافي خلاص اترك الموبايل عندك يمكو  يلا اذا وصلت لي يلا تاخرت yala adha wasalat li takhart yla tamaam naeam yala ayi wink ant yimuk ylan wasalat li atruk wiink kafi khalas atruk almubayil eindak yumak>>><<<منتظرك انا وصلت يلا يمك يلا شكرا <br> وصلت يمك انا يلا للبيت واناهلاا يلاوصلت  <br> تاخرت يلاو يمكو ساعه صلت يمك yalan mu ntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuliyal aalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamak matanikيلاوصلت سياره استعجلت اروح انا شكرا لك يلاوصلت يمكويامتانيكyulawsalat sayaaruh aistaejalat aruh ana shukran lak yulawasalt yamkuyamtanik>>><<<منتظرك انا وصلت يلا يلاوصلت انا يلا<br> للبيتyalan muntaziruk ana wasalat yla yulawasalt ana yla lilbaytيلاوصلت البيت ساعه تعال وين السياره شكرا لك يلا مستعجله تانيك يلاوصلت يلاوصلت يلا سياره yulawsalat albayt saeah taeal wyn alsayaaruh shukran lak ylan mustaejiluh tanik yla yla bisayar>>><<<منتظرك انا وصلت يلا يمك يلا شكرا  <br> وصلت يمك انا يلا للبيت واناهلاا يلاوصلت <br> تاخرت يلاو يمكو صلت يمك yalan muntaziruk ana wasalt yila yamakhalwuli yalaalsa yaaruh yulawasalt yamk ana ylan lilbayt wanahilaa yilan yamakmatanik>>><<<I’ve seen that exact plane on Flightradar24>>><<<Try flying Ryanair Wizz air and Cebu pacific and Zipair>>><<<This is so refreshing seeing how it really work>>><<<What about Vietnam airline?>>><<<If I were on that flight I would be keeping everything that Sam served me for souvenirs !! Love it Sam how you made serving very personalized by knowing their names , &quot; seats quality &quot; and how talking to passengers really could help to improve flight experience . Thank you especially for  opening our eyes how tuff stewardess working to serve us. Well done team Scoot !!>>><<<Hi Sam, thanks for show the Scoot and I would like to try it for my next travel to Sydney to visit my Family ❤❤❤>>><<<Scoot lost my Armani coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and they refused to compensate for the loss. I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.<br><br>In summary, AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.>>><<<shocking but no tv why?>>><<<Sam, you have such a wonderful life flying on the best (and worst) airlines and telling us about your experiences. Fascinating vlogs; thank you for sharing!>>><<<The flight would have been better without him>>><<<Bro is saying it is hard just because he is fat>>><<<I flew on scoot from Sabah,Malaysia to Singapore.

Of course they are nice with you Sam>>><<<This suits you far more than being a pilot, Sam.<br>Sorry, just being real.>>><<<Dude this is the reality of the hard working flight attendants okkkuuuuurrrrr>>><<<I’ve never heard of this airline, I am very impressed!  I would definitely choose them given the opportunity.  I flew across the US two days , Several mishaps occurred, but of course that’s no reason to behave poorly. I like to believe everyone is doing their best.  Finally arrived at my destination many many hours later than expected, but I’m alive!  Hahaha we had to abort the landing due to wind turbulence from the plane taking off in front of us… I woke the other passengers up shouting “oh shit, oh shit! “ as I watched the wings wobble dramatically…😂😂😂😂 fun times.   I was on a United flight, and they gave us free food to make up for all the nonsense, so that was nice of them. Hopefully my red eye back home will be less exciting.>>><<<A 380!?!?>>><<<Fligh attendants worked none stop>>><<<Scoot flights are rickety, the seats need lots of changing, uncomfortable. Lots of peeling. But the crew? 10/10. Really great service, professional and kind crew.>>><<<I loved flying scoot and have done for the last 10 years. <br>They have lost my favour now since they are suspending the Singapore/Gold Coast route as of July. I had to get refunded for 2 of my trips I had already booked for after July. Very disappointed with Scoot and will not fly SA either out of principle. I had flow Gold Coast to Thailand return on Scoot 7 times in the last 13 months.>>><<<Welcome to Melbourne>>><<<I’ll be honest scoot is actually a good flight I’ve always had a really good experience with them>>><<<I went on Scoot last month, and came back with Singapore airlines because Scoot airlines is horrible!! I went from Melbourne to Singapore about 7 hours. It was the worst flight ever!!! Everyone on board were complaining too saying they&#39;d never fly with Scoot again. There was no aircon at all and on that day it was boiling. Also which airline doesn&#39;t give you water unless you pay 4 US dollars??? Water has always been free and the water they give you is such a small amount for 4 US dollars that your still thirsty afterwards. Their food was horrible too. And of course the crew members were very rude. They had a rude attitude and if you&#39;d press the flight attendant light they would take ages to come. Honestly , I would never fly it again and I wish I knew before flying because that was suppose to be one of the best trips of my life.>>><<<Sam, you somehow convinced me to book with Scoot in my next flight ✈️.

No phone and the App is difficult, not showing what days they fly and not able to connect with SAL.>>><<<very cool sam!>>><<<They are one of the worse airlines in the region.

I flew Sin-Syd  in early March 23 and got a seat totally torn and pasted with masking tape. No fault of the crew - but no service recovery other than a blanket. When I lodged a complaint, they said they are looking at it. After 1.5 months, they are still looking at it. Very poor service recovery. I wish I could post a pic here. You will be shocked with the condition of the seat. I am still waiting for their decision.>>><<<What a fun video! They all work hard !!>>><<<Sam Chui and your friends my best wishes 😊🥰🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤❤❤>>><<<Another great video Sam. What an opportunity for you to be a “crewmember” for a day. So many of us are unfamiliar with Scoot and their operation but thanks to you and this channel I would be very much inclined to book with Scoot. Their service and product along with passenger testimonials seals the deal for me. Thank you again for what you’re doing for aviation.>>><<<NBC new hit show… Air-pprentice 😂😂>>><<<Hello Sam!

Keep up the excellent work my man!>>><<<I fly from Berlin to Singapore, this is my first time with Scoot and the last time 😂 They hunting &quot;low cost&quot; traverel for cheap price, but unfortunetly the fly ticket not include anything. Also they not allow you brig your own food or dring onboard. So you must all from over priced menu. When i caluculate all after fly, its the same price like fly with Qatar with full servis include.

I don&#39;t mind paying for influght meals on a lowco airline but paying that price and getting something barely edible is an insult.<br><br>AirAsia is much better in this regard.

Quality service, Equipment>>><<<I flew on Scoot from Sydney to Singapore. Their service levels were on par or better than a full service carrier. One of the crew saw that my 8 year old daughter was fascinated by what they were doing, so they asked if they could take her out to the galley and give her a bit of a tour. After 30 minutes went by, I got up to go and find her only to discover 4 of the crew doing her hair to match theirs before they got her to help out as though she was part of the team. Next minute, she’s walking down the aisle being helpful! She was so happy and the crew were genuinely spectacular. That was years ago now and she still talks about it.>>><<<You are inspirational Sam. I would just love to try being cabin crew for a day. I think being cabin crew on a low cost airline is much more demanding than full service.>>><<<what an idea... a good way to give people some new experience in aviation industry👍👍👍>>><<<Sam, what can  I say but &quot;good on you&quot;, for putting yourself out there on the receiving end. This video, albeit choreographed, does give a  good insight into what goes on behind the scene. Hopefully passengers understand and appreciate this when they next fly. Thank you.>>><<<Every time I see your video,<br>I envy your job.<br>In particular, today&#39;s video was<br>very interesting Thank you for your hard work>>><<<I would never fly with them again, I flew with them from London Gatwick to Bangkok, flight crew looked like they just come out of school<br>Not even a blanket for a night flight, no USB ports, nothing and was not cheap>>><<<This might be my favorite yet Sam! Love all the behind the scenes looks and the conversation with the Captain.>>><<<I hope you do lots more of these videos, behind the scenes is so interesting, we as passengers don&#39;t see.  Great vid, my best from YUL>>><<<Another great video &amp; superb insight into all the effort and hard the work the crew experience (all airlines ofcourse) whilst also keeping a positive &amp; friendly face. You also actually started to feel tired in a short space of time😄 The pilots/crew all looked welcoming>>><<<Any feedback from the Scoot&#39;s customer taking Singapore Laksa?>>><<<How are you doing ✌🏾>>><<<Sam a awesome YouTube footage, we enjoyed it tremendously. Thanks my friend.>>><<<Probably your best video Sam. Loved seeing you get to work, this was a fresh perspective that your other videos don’t have. Respect for the Scoot team, they are working hard.>>><<<Last month was the first time I travel abroad in my life out of Malaysia (because I&#39;m no rich people), when I flew to Melbourne using Scoot. It will always hold a special place in my heart because it was really the first time in my life to flew inside other airlines aside from Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia. Here&#39;s to flying more.>>><<<I enjoyed this video Sam…>>><<<That was a great addition Sam,  but my only trouble budget airlines shouldn’t ask passengers to pay for the food service it should be provided and delivered to the passenger’s seat but this is a budget airline for short haul flights, Scoot is different and the crew is wonderful including the senior staff. Congratulations Sam you did well. <br>You need to work on your landings though. Namaste brother.>>><<<Hey Sam, awesome flight and loved the flight attendant Ms. Bubu bless her heart.  And do you think at some point you may pursue the commercial pilot&#39;s license after sampling the 787 via their flight simulator?  Very very nice.  Please keep coming out with more vlogs!!>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyLAXLife">https://www.youtube.com/@MyLAXLife</a>>>><<<We&#39;re flying Scoot in a few months time from Australia to Singapore. I read complaints online but most seem quite minor. Cost of water which does seem excessive. Also, cost of charging devices, Food quality.  Anyway, It is a budget airline with good aircraft, so I think we&#39;ll survive. 😁>>><<<Excellent Sam. A flight attendant’s life seems so glamorous, but here we see it’s hard work, and I’ve much better insight. Thank you.>>><<<He is doing it for a low-cost airline>>><<<When are u coming back to Trinity and give us a speech.❤>>><<<Bubu is a pro and great teacher>>><<<I’m sure flying with Sam Chui would be fun.<br><br>However this makes total sense!  It’s Scoot!  Flew them last year Singapore-Macau round trip.  As a subsidiary of the normally excellent and full service Singapore Airlines, Scoot couldn’t be more the polar opposite.  We had only about 25-30 passengers when I flew last spring under tight Covid restrictions.  As there is only one class…economy on these flights, I paid a little extra to get an aisle seat on an emergency row.  I do this regularly on Air Ásia.  Upon entering the aircraft in Singapore, I noticed something strange immediately.  Many people crammed in the back of the aircraft.  Why?  <br>I sat down in my seat and buckled up.  However it wasn’t until after the aircraft began to taxi, I realized the reasons.  I wasn’t seated in an Economy Plus seat!  But why?  I had paid for it.  <br><br>I inquired with the flight attendant.  Turns out they had switched aircraft type after I bought my ticket since Covid meant fewer passengers.  The passengers crammed in the back?  Those seats no longer existed on the smaller aircraft!  They had not bothered to adjust any seating.<br><br>Finally they moved me to a Economy Plus seat after the meal, but it took way to long and they seemed to be arguing about whether to even do that!<br><br>As directed, I filed a complaint online with the airline, but they never bothered to even respond.  <br><br>Another thing, Scoot operates completely independent of Singapore Air.  When connecting, don’t expect Singapore Air to help in any way.  It’s like Scoot is kryptonite.<br><br>Arriving in Macau, we found out that seating was important in regards to Covid protocols!  We were immediately isolated and tested and one passenger had Covid.  So there was added scrutiny around seating assignments.  Then we started our crazy two weeks of hotel quarantine!<br><br>But Scoot?  It was virtually the only way in or out of Macau at the time without quarantining in yet another country first.  <br><br>Glad Sam enjoyed his flight, but I won’t be joining him.  But it is like cheap SCOOT to promote their airline by hiring Sam for one day!>>><<<Another awesome video Sam, Thank you!>>><<<You&#39;re really funny Sam. I enjoy your Vlogs so much. It&#39;s a complete entertainment package.>>><<<So cool of scoot to allow you to experience this. 😂>>><<<I appreciate for your video. I know that every work is not easy but I dont expect flight attendants this more difficult. Thank you for your work to all flight attendants. To remind all passengers, we are guests to their house once on a plane. So be patients, polite, and kind to the house owners and guests on the plane that like you. Don&#39;t forget be safe and use seat belt once required.>>><<<A good one, Sam. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to become a licensed pilot one day. Ah, but you can’t be bothered with too much work. 😔>>><<<MY REVIEW:<br>Hi Sam. I met you at Clutter Park last time you were  there.  This video is incredible. THE audio is loud, and level and clear and perfect from start to finish.  Everyone has excellent audio.  The multiple cameras was great.  From the cams in the kitchen to inside and outside the simulator.  Cams in the cockpit watching the crew and cams watching the runway and landing and controls. Cams in the cabin with many different angles. Incredible editing and transitions. The flight crew speaking with you like you were a co-worker and friend. This was like a Hollywood production. I loved the humanity of it all. I felt connected to the staff and the flight.  The feelings and emotions you expressed while working- from fun to tired, to sore back.. Very human and real.  With a live shoot like this, there is no way to script this, but it was perfect from start to finish.  THE PR  gained from this video will be powerful.  Anyone watching this video would want to fly Singapore.  You made them proud. The warmth and kindness and stunning beauty of the staff really comes through.  I felt appreciation and a connection to all the flight crew.  This was impressive and professional.... Nothing self serving or ego about this- Just darn good production and a video of perfection.  Now I understand why doors open for you and you are given the access you get. Thanks for sharing this with the viewers... thank you Flight crew and Singapore airlines...>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxGs3uBGk8c&amp;t=191">03:11</a> cute couple... when is the wedding? 😀>>><<<❤❤ great video 😊😊>>><<<This was awesome! Thanks 🙏🏽 for sharing this Sam 🤜🏽💥🤛🏽>>><<<No comment !>>><<<Scoot is pretty good,  The check in staff see I am not good on the kiosk but as always Scoot staff see this and come and help. The cabin crew make you feel so comfortable and at ease. The food is still a bit ordinary though. Have a couple flights coming up in May so look forward to it. They do it tough up there and passengers should appreciate them more. 🙏👍>>><<<God Bless You for Your Stream!!!>>><<<Love the content  SAM>>><<<Great video Sam!>>><<<Nice work 🙏🏽>>><<<Thank you Sam🎯>>><<<✋👞>>><<<Always innovative topics Sam!

What a different experience it has been not only for you but us also as viewers. Thank you for the video.>>><<<Sam I&#39;d like to thank you and Scoot for showing us what really happens on an airline.

Thanks!>>><<<Well done very useful one fantastic scoot air gd one can recommend ❤>>><<<Who is holding your camera?>>><<<The &#39;Scoot experience&#39; part was cringey. Passengers getting up to fake dance with the crew, good lord.>>><<<Great video Sam...always informative....>>><<<Want to see Sam as air-pprentice on Biman Bangladesh Airlines!>>><<<Very nice experience.....>>><<<I certainly gained a greater appreciation for flight attendants on these long haul flights. They work hard, fill many responsibilities, it seems exhausting, and they need to smile through it all. The Lead Flight Attendant, Bubu, really showed professionalism throughout.>>><<<372 seats in an 787? OMG :)>>><<<What a great experience, and I know you had a good time 😊>>><<<说实话，这次从印尼回中国大陆就是乘坐的Scoot Airways，无论从中转航站楼(最旧的T1)，还是地勤的工作态度、还有地勤以及机组工作的专业度，完全让人大失所望。3月30日发送的投诉邮件，到今天为止23天过去了，什么反馈都没有！劝所有人，如果能避免，尽量避免廉价航空吧；如果实在避免不了，还是选中转停留时间最短的两段航班吧。即便Scoot是新加坡航空旗下的公司，但它还是廉航，连最基础的服务都做不好。而且新加坡T1，真的是又旧又小又不人性化！>>><<<Rubbish airline. I will never fly with them again ever. It seems like SQ send all their rejects there and do a how not to run an airline demo.>>><<<Well scoot is my favourite because powered by Singapore Airlines>>><<<Great video! Scoot is good. It doesn&#39;t feel like a budget airline. I have flown twice on Scoot to Tokyo and on both flights, the toilets were very clean!>>><<<Thank you very much sam Chui  for this video🤲🍊🍋🍊🍋🤲>>><<<Very interactive video>>><<<when u realize asian low cost airlines have better service than US legacy airlines>>><<<All bloody indians😂>>><<<Nice bright yellow shirt, Sam>>><<<Good stuff and yellow polo definitely looks better on you than a sarang kebaya.>>><<<Awesome video Sami….will use scoot next time they seem like a very good airline to travel with and the staff seem super nice and friendly…keep up the good work 🙌🏻❤️>>><<<Very nice video>>><<<Love seeing all the hard work the FA&#39;s do>>><<<What a fun vlog Sam!!!!

I have no idea you were here else I would have been there to meet you!>>><<<It&#39;s great to see behind the scenes 👏>>><<<Great video!  Fun and informative.  Much respect to the crew who make our flights as safe and pleasant as they can.>>><<<I had a smile on my face from the start to the finish of this video. Terrific idea and very entertaining. First Class!>>><<<Interesting insights.  I&#39;m wondering if the flight-despatchers are trained solely by the airlines, &#39;on the job&#39;, or if they have to obtain a certification from national aviation authorities?<br>The cabin-crew come across really well here.<br>Scoot?  I&#39;d give them a try.>>><<<Hi Sam  do you remember me>>><<<Hi sam very good video>>><<<WOW.. Nice Flight Flyng To be scoot crew>>><<<want to see Sam be an air apprentice in more videos. It&#39;s interesting to see what happens behind the scene!>>><<<excellent video. what a flight. thanks for suchna great experience. Passengers respect and coperate with the Crew. they are working hard to make us comfortable.>>><<<Awesome, what a dream to try this. , thanks for sharing your experience Sir.<br>James in Southern California>>><<<What an amazing video as always.>>><<<Very different and awesome experience indeed, sir. Personally in my time to visit Singapore, I have never flown with Singapore Airlines, Jetstar Asia, and even Scoot but hopefully i will have a chance to fly one of 3 Singaporean airlines in the future. Btw, 🙏Happy Eid Ul Fitr Mubarak from Indonesia🇲🇨>>><<<I have flown with Scoot twice and they were fantastic.

Hope you do more videos like this.>>><<<omg the crews are very busy>>><<<Great job Sam 😂😂😂>>><<<👍👍👍>>><<<Scoot .. sucks!  Especially when being forced to use them as a connection on a full price ticket from SIA after an all nighter!  Staffed by kids, who are obviously cheaper for the payroll.>>><<<Awesome vlog sam thumb up>>><<<Better than Jetstar but same same when comes to refunds. They make it near impossible to get your money back if you miss the flight or its cancelled. Singaporean state sponsored fraud. Credit vouchers expire so its money for nothing for them.>>><<<Nice Video Sam Chui! Keep up the great content>>><<<I watched this plane land a few days ago in Melbourne!>>><<<hello samchui , why the 747-8 test plane , md 11 , md 90 , boeing 717 , airbus a340-200/300/500 was not in the museum>>><<<Fantastic Sam ❤>>><<<Awesome vid!>>><<<Try out Air India after TATA takeover>>><<<😂Thanks for sharing this video 🤭👍>>><<<Awesome 👌>>><<<First comment 🇮🇳 from India 🇮🇳 ❤️ love you sam>>><<<Hello Sam.

If they aren’t,I will choose regular airlines>>><<<Now there&#39;s none of Scoot flight from Berlin to Singapore 😢>>><<<Max 5hrs and its already a torture>>><<<Btw how much is this flight? I&#39;ll check for mere curiosity>>><<<Here&#39;s a cookie bro, no but no thank you...>>><<<Definitely not for me. Not long haul flights anyway.  Thanks for the vid. 👍👍👍>>><<<bro i swear singapore things are expensive asf 😭>>><<<Scoot operted there a320-200/a320neo/a321neo for short and some medium haul flights.Scoot uses their 787-8/9 for long haul.>>><<<You should review now the low cost flight Barcelona - Santiago de Chile on Level which is 14h>>><<<For me, the no seat recline is actually a bonus.  I don&#39;t care about it, but it stops the people in front of me from reclining into my space!>>><<<I remember back in the day the entertainment was only a few channels on the onboard radio,,, and the middle area would have a movie running on the big screen for everyone to watch.. they could at least get this back on these low cost airlines?>>><<<It&#39;s  a budget airline. What do you expect. If you want full amenities then pay extra duh?!!>>><<<5 hours>>><<<a parcel on a cargo plane gets treated better than a Scoot economy class passenger>>><<<13 hours no movie set &amp; pillow &amp; blanket I don’t take it but it’s good still thanks for the video>>><<<Max is 4 hrs>>><<<techincally, we are paying for the food and drinks on a normal flight. so it&#39;s not &quot;free&quot;>>><<<I have flown Scoot on SIN-SYD (8.5 hours) for a few times now and been thankful every time. I am a huge cheapo so I almost never pay for add-ons to my ticket EXCEPT for 80mb of wifi. I do tend to pack light so I just use my cabin luggage. (Unlike some American airlines, Scoot overhead bins are never full). Scoot is good in allowing up to 10kg for cabin luggage. Although Scoot claims that the 10kg allowance is for both cabin luggage and personal item, I’ve never encountered a counter staff demanding to weigh my personal item. So yeah if you have something super heavy, put it in your personal item instead of your cabin luggage while at the counter lol. (You can always slip it into cabin luggage later)<br><br>I have found that reading up on what Scoot offers and preparing accordingly, is the best way to take advantage of the good prices. For example you mention that the price of water is expensive, which is true, but also most people bring empty water bottles (you are allowed to bring up to 1L containers) which they fill up at the water coolers after getting past security checks. That should resolve a lot of your hydration issues. Regarding food I’ve noticed that most people do buy food from Scoot which is fine, but again you can either pack your own food/snacks from home, or buy them at the airport. Entertainment can easily be solved by pre-downloading shows to watch on your phone/tablet and you can even download shows while waiting to board at the airport! For the older folks most of them brought along a book. For power bring your own battery pack. Please don’t be that person who spends 8 hours in the flight watching videos on your phone only to realise that your battery is now low.<br><br>As a 160cm (5’3”) person, I don’t have issues with legroom, although I did recently buy a footrest hammock which was incredible and helped me sleep 6 hours on an 8.5 hour flight! Bring your own neck pillow if you like those, and it’s always good to have an extra jacket and/or scarf to keep warm since the cabin can get quite cold.<br><br>In all honesty, in my opinion flying Scoot rewards people who are familiar with how airports/airlines work, and prepares in advance for any needs they might have… and punishes people who fail to plan. If you need to check in luggage, it’s around 30SGD when you purchase early… if you check in luggage at the airport, it costs 110SGD which is insane. Don’t fall into that trap! If you’re a traveller who plans well though, Scoot is definitely a great option. I find the seats comfortable, flight crew friendly, and of course great price!>>><<<great videos, always wonder how you shoot the hyperlapses and timelapses in airport, do you need permission from airport security or authorities?>>><<<According to their policy, consumption of outside food and beverages are not allowed on board though….>>><<<They competing with ryanair for worst seats>>><<<I took this exact route in 2019. Will do it again if the price is right. <br><br>The cons were that you need to bring at least a serving of food and water to make the price worthwhile. Don&#39;t forget to bring your own blanket, pillow, and entertainment. Food, though edible, were not good.>>><<<I’d rather do greyhound>>><<<I dont care, tape me to yhe ceiling 😂😂 just mske the flight cheap>>><<<welp im still flying this to Langkawi on their A320...>>><<<I flew with Scoot from Singapore to Chiang Mai. The attendant did not allow me to eat the burger I bought from Singapore I.A 7/11 store. That was very unfriendly for me. I seriously starved for almost 4 hours during that flight. So when I landed in Chiang Mai IA, I hurriedly grabbed my burger so I could regain my energy. They should change that very unfavorable policy.>>><<<I was on that same flight last year. But from Singapore to Berlin, before flying back to home. I went to Melbourne as well. Also with Scoot. Been there with Jetsar and Finnair. Overall, still same to me. Long flights are never fun, until you arrive.  But also at the same time. Very fond memories. So it did bring me back for sure :D&lt;3>>><<<brave man>>><<<bro my guy was on scoot for 1 hours when i could not even survive 3>>><<<Just give me enough oxygen so I can be unconscious the entire flight but still alive at my destination>>><<<2.5 hours only 😂>>><<<It&#39;s not that bad for Scoot. I took a economy flight from Singapore to Jakarta and the service was great, the food was good and you could even buy a Scoot &#39;Pikachu Jet&#39; model with the Pokemon livery.>>><<<Good luck with the injections>>><<<water in Singapore is much more expensive than Beer 😂>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=84">1:24</a> Yeah, tell that to Malpensa airport.>>><<<The silent cabin is amazing. i would pay and arm and a leg to remove kids from planes. those fuckers dont need intl air travel and anyone bringing a crying baby onto a plane should be labelled a terrorist. 7 hours HK to Sydney. imagine.>>><<<If you think the water price is expensive then maybe dont fly to Singapore :D>>><<<nice trip and nice plane spotting video 👍>>><<<7 hrs>>><<<Oh gosh, did you see a doctor after the flight? 😅😅>>><<<Will Scoot flight attendants lock the dimmable window settings?>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=341">5:41</a> Auf Wiedersehen Berlin!>>><<<Scoot lost my Armani coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and they refused to compensate for the loss. I followed all the steps and provided all the supporting documents, but the airline refused to compensate for the lost item without explaining why.<br><br>What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating &quot;you should do this and you should do that&quot; again and again. For more than a month, I have been trying to talk to the department which is in charge of this matter, but no one was available.<br><br>In summary, AVOID SCOOT AT ALL COST if you value your time and money.>>><<<I think 5 hours max>>><<<disgusting ewwww>>><<<Typical german guy ziemlicher beta male guy mit ner jeans auf nem 12 stunden flight und wurstfinger>>><<<FCK BERLIN LITRALLY the worst town in germany>>><<<AX much better...smarter leadership>>><<<I took a flight from Taipei(TPE) to Moscow in 2014. There was no entertainment but they provided food. The flight was about 11 hours, so I brought a book on the plane. But now I will take the typical economy class if I fly more than 6 hours.>>><<<That looks like hell 😂>>><<<Are the crew members called &quot;Scooters&quot;>>><<<13h ohne Bordunterhaltung 😮😮😮>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=134">2:14</a> as TR_<i>__</i>>>><<<Honestly, nothing more than 6 hours. Unless there is wifi<br><br>Also, I feel like only Asian old like this flight>>><<<can you bring bottled water on flight? I really dont want to pay for water...>>><<<To this day the worst airline I’ve ever flown. I did two round trips between Tokyo and Singapore in 2022 on Scoot, about eight hours long. And both times I had just the most rude crew, and overall a truly unpleasant experience. Plus they really do come down on you for the smallest things. I had a candy bar I was eating from the Changi Airport 7-Eleven that the flight attendant snatched out of my hand because “no food from outside the plane is allowed”. Similarly, they don’t let you wear headphones during taxi, takeoff, and landing, which did not help my anxieties about takeoff/landing at all. Zero stars, I’ll gladly pay more to never deal with them again. Spirit had better service 🤐>>><<<Thanks for reviewing so that we don&#39;t have to suffer. Indigo Follow the same model or much worse. 531 seats in B777. If i were the head of any regulatory agency i would not have approved such flights. This is good for short people. Anyone who is above 190CM in height will suffer in this.>>><<<1 hour max....>>><<<2 hours>>><<<I flew with Norwegian on one of their narrow-body aircraft CPH/DXB back when they used to fly it. 6+hrs in that seat was really tough, as both were night flights. No entertainment, no food or water unless you paid, no pillows, no blankets, reclined approx 3deg (maybe), no comforts what so ever. Never again. It was like trying to sleep on a local bus seat. I only flew it to fit into a client&#39;s budget for the job, but will not do that again. They don&#39;t fly that route anymore. No surprises really when Emirates was slightly more expensive but you get everything.>>><<<HOW DO YOU SURVIVE, respect>>><<<Come on, water should be free on flights. In come Indigo!!!>>><<<So i supppose €20 more one way with free water, more tasty food and free power outlets would make this &quot;not bad at all&quot;. I&#39;d die in those seats though. Almost 2m and kinda wide at the shoulders. If i got the isle seat in any economy people bump into my shoulders let alone the stewardesses with their little carts ;)>>><<<I watched this to get an idea on Scoot, because I have been seeing this option via Athens and Singapore while looking for SE Asia flights from Istanbul. I don’t mind at all. I had actually boarded an India Railways 3rd class overnight train, spending the night on something that can be counted as a park bench. Though the silence option without babies is a win for me.>>><<<Hav question who fly route berlin-bkk, stop in Athen 1hr, just stay in the same airplane? No need to get off right? Are there many late &amp; cancelation happened frequently? I really not sure, but price for the other airline are super crazy...>>><<<Glad to know they have seat power outlets, but what about internet?>>><<<Plus how early do u get to the airport???>>><<<5h bro from Singapore Changi International Airport To Xian Xianyang International Airport on a Scoot A320neo>>><<<Umm you could have always used Schönefeld airport instead of Tegel and could have gone by train to Schönefeld for decades 😂 now you’re taking the same train to BER 😂>>><<<Having watched the video, I really hope I’d never have to.>>><<<For most of my life, I have travelled with low-cost airlines/low-cost subsidiaries, where flights were only 2 hours long, but 12 hours on a low-cost?? I&#39;d definitely not do that, because a fews hours is good enough only.>>><<<I always have this rule, that if the flight will be more than 5 hours, I will never ever fly low-cost, regardless of their price offer.>>><<<NEW PLANE BİG PLANE BUT NO IFE,HEADRESTS,FOOTRESTS,  GOOD MEALS, BLANKET AND PİLLOW <br>ONLY İN SCOOT💀💀💀💀>>><<<EA airlines 😂>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot Biz twice from Europe - Australia, the only plus is the seat and good legroom.  The service and food is dreadful.  Would I fly them again..... yeah why not.>>><<<Flew once on Scoot MEL-SIN in Scoot-In-Silence seat- very good piloting; flight was peacful &amp; reliable~<br>😌>>><<<For the water, if you ask the staff they will fill up your bottle or give you a cup of water. You don&#39;t have to buy, but they only give you a small amount each time.>>><<<Fill your water bottle from tap after security, all 2 litres for free>>><<<I&#39;ve no hesitation in flying Scoot. Good value, excellent aircraft (Dreamliner), good crew, always on time for flights I&#39;ve taken. Plus Singapore Kris Flyer points.>>><<<Babies should be banned from airlines....period>>><<<The &quot;Silence&quot; section sounds like a really good option for such a long haul flight. Curious how much more it costs (I just tried on their website, but did not want to go too far, so didn&#39;t find out).>>><<<Ahh Scoot ... The airline that dares you to change your booking, as it costs less buying a new ticket than changing your flight date. In all honesty, its the biggest rip off airline I ever flew>>><<<The seats are terrible. That was my main issue. I couldnt sleep on an 11hr +7hr flights and return.too and had back and back and neck pain after.>>><<<Its too dissapointing to have no IFE>>><<<Under those conditions I would say 4 hours max>>><<<I would do max 6 - 8 hours>>><<<I was watching this on a flight and thought the PA was on my plane lol>>><<<I say 5 hours on wow air from Baltimore to Reykjavik>>><<<Next September I will be flying with Singapore Airline from Frankfurt to Indonesia via Singapore and it costs only for 740 euros with baggage allowance 30 Kgs. I would never fly with low cost carrier if I had long flight. It is not worth it at all. Only +100 euros and you will enjoy your flight with unlimitied wifi, foods, etc>>><<<At last !!!!!! Someone who does a review of cattle class !!! Great to see !!!>>><<<Lol try Melbourne to London with Scoot and 18 hour layover Singapore Airport>>><<<lots of empty seats to grab>>><<<Wow, unbelievable, I also flew the 9V-OFI last year! I did ATH SIN BKK. <br>I had some downloaded media on my devices, packed some snacks and purchased lunch beforehand in the app. Honestly loved the experience, for 200 usd!>>><<<I really like the brutally honest series, keep the great work.>>><<<The MAX is 3 hrs>>><<<I did the Athens Singapore flight. They offered movies via a iPad-like device.>>><<<This year in March the Scoot flight economy cost as much as Singapore airlines economy did last year for the same trip. Not really a cheap cost anymore, but still cheap quality. Two hours with Scoot was enough for me…>>><<<My longest flight on a low-cost-carrier was with Wizzair from Brussels, Belgium to Abu Dhabi, UAE. It was 6 hours and 20 minutes in their a321NX. The price was great and the food tastet suprisingly fine in contrast to Ryanair. You can pre-order meals or buy beverages and snacks at the airport. The cabin was also extremely quiet so it made it rly easy to sleep. It wasn&#39;t that bad as I expected. I&#39;d enjoyed the flight even if the legroom was... no comment. It wasn&#39;t rly that bad so imma fly low-cost-cariers more frequent now :)>>><<<well i flew long haul non budget airlines and all i wanna do is sleep. tbh, youd only spend an hour on the entertainment. what is more impt to me is a spotify playlist hahaha>>><<<5 hrs max>>><<<You sound like John De Lancie aka &#39;Q&#39; from Star Trek The Next Generation>>><<<Last summer I did 15 hours in an A350 (both ways)...in Economy. Not fun,but I survived.>>><<<5 hrs 30 mins from Qatar to Budapest on a basic economy class 3 3 seat plane. Will never do that again lol. I still got a meal, pillow, blanket, and tv, but the legroom is just too small. I once flew using Jetstar from Singapore to Perth but luckily I bought a seat in the first row. I think I could still survive without pillow and blanket, but I need decent space for my legs during long flights.>>><<<No tv ?>>><<<being 203 cms id die in these seats>>><<<I flew with Scoot from Singapore to Athens and I wasn’t feeling good on my return trip and asked for water, my bank card wasn’t working and I had no cash, I literally had to plea with them to allow me to get water from the tap where the staff drink, it took me at least 30 minutes until they let me fill up a cup of water even though I told them I wasn’t feeling great, staff later told me that every bottle water is counted for and if there is discrepancies staff will be punished, that’s why they only let me fill up a cup and not give me bottle water. I would still travel with them however to save huge $$$, but don’t expect free water if you are feeling sick. 😶😶>>><<<I will spend anytime in a low cost airline at least there is entertainment in the airline app>>><<<im on scoot last February Singapore to  Cebu  4 hours ha! try 10 stuck on the ground in Philippines I don&#39;t know where?  sit here don&#39;t change seats ? in plane order ? i can see the plane out the window . given water  back on the same plane sit anywhere ? maybe they will be good one day>>><<<We flew Scoot from Sydney to Singapore in 2022. Take off was delayed by 2 hours, thank got my husband got 2 sandwiches and Pringle&#39;s chips from the airport. We were served &quot;Mum&#39;s fried rice&quot;, it was not even heated properly and portion is extremely small. I asked for a coffee and water, not knowing it would be served with a tablet to pay AUD $15.00, it was the worst coffee(again not warm enough, and I know airplane coffee tastes bad, but this was worst). We knew we got the tickets for cheap and it was a budget airlines, but man, was it bad. We should&#39;ve found out more before booking. After reaching Singapore, I told my husband, if he ever booked this airlines, I&#39;m leaving him 😂>>><<<My daughter just did Melbourne to Athens via Singapore on Scoot.  Due to a very long layover in Singapore and delays the flight took 31 hours!  She said the worst part was waiting 12 hours overnight at Changing airport>>><<<Scoot is not really cheap for a budget carrier. If you are willing to top up a bit you may fly with a normal carrier and get food, water, entertainment.>>><<<Scoot is really good. You just need to have your expectations to a bare minimum. I agree with you, the meals are really awful. Keep a big bottle of water with you and a book on hand.>>><<<If you can’t afford air travel at a reasonable price, why travel in the first place?>>><<<They could charge the water into your fare and give it to you free.>>><<<a job>>><<<From personal experience, Scoot is as awful as its sister company, Singapore Airlines is great!>>><<<Since I reached a really good level in my career woth a good salary I pay lovely for business to have really good confort, a good sleep and meal for fligths over 7 hours. Everything below I can survive in eco bit longer, I earn the money, I soend it.>>><<<5.5 hrs  flight to Perth from Singapore , never again>>><<<No way to travel 😂😂>>><<<This was a living Hell. Scoot was invented by the Devil to torture human beings.>>><<<Pretty shocking about the water. Comfort aside, that is a passenger safety issue. A lack of water can cause thrombosis, and the complications of thrombosis can be a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Price-savings aside, airlines should be required to do the minimum to make sure that their passengers will not be endangered during flights.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=123">2:03</a> boah fuck alter 😂>>><<<Flew with Scoot from Sydney to SG. Never again lmao. I think I can still handle SG-Tokyo or SG-HK but that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=450">7:30</a> hrs red eye flight was simply the most tiring leg of flight I ever took>>><<<0 minutes>>><<<To me it&#39;s 2h max on a budget airline. Nowadays I don&#39;t mind (only hesitate) on paying double to take a normal airline. My comfort and good mood are not payable with a few hundred of euros.>>><<<2-3 MAX!>>><<<bro is big bird 180cm 😀>>><<<done sydney to Athens twice with scoot, harden up>>><<<I was flight also with scoot from Berlin to Singapore , it was nice flight until I got terrible jetleg when I’m arrived home 😂>>><<<it was stormy in Singapore <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=645">10:45</a>>>><<<20 minutes>>><<<I’ve never flown one lol>>><<<I usually fly scoot for like 5 hr flight which is not too bad.<br><br>But I once fly long haul once (due to not having any other option to fly to my destination) The experience is terrible.<br>I booked via SG so it comes with all the kit and food but everything is just bad.>>><<<I don&#39;t know who l why but I got surprised he had an Austrian passport>>><<<what did u expect. its a budget airline>>><<<part of my cousin&#39;s honeymoon was on Scoot and she had nothing but negative things to say about the carrier and the experience.>>><<<They are not even a budget airline.  Once you add in luggage it is cheaper to fly a normal airline.  Just a totally pointless exercise as far as I can see.  Basically a scam.>>><<<It&#39;s is scoot air Boeing 787>>><<<This is just dehumanising 😢>>><<<3-4 hours. I&#39;d never try to save some money flying longhaul on this airline, Zip Air of Japan seems to be much more generous and will try them but Scoot, no thanks.>>><<<You should try Cebu Pacific flight Manila-Dubai on their A330-900 high density configuration. No entertainment screen and seat pitch for short Asian people. Even 8h30 min. is terrible.>>><<<I recently did a return trip on this exact route. Wifi was bad, and I was completely board all the way. 😢. On the bright side, I flew business class, where there are actually power points to charge up electrical items.>>><<<Scoot is not cheap at all. I compared the prices with Qatar airways to Manila and it is more expensive than Qatar. What a joke of an airline.>>><<<I spent 2 hours and 44 minutes with Ryanair from Manchester to Riga.>>><<<That video was so nostalagic>>><<<I literally come back to this after David&#39;s brutally honest on Zipair.>>><<<By far my favourite aviation channel anywhere on the internet. So organised, truthspoken and great quality videos. Huge respect!!>>><<<Fun fact: I had a nightmare where I had to fly scoot for 10+ hours last night>>><<<Scoot could have just provided a video screen for entertainment. Probably the loneliest flight ever.>>><<<Bro should be knighted for taking this flight 😂<br><br>Personally though, I won&#39;t hop in an LCC for more than 4 hours since I will need food, drinks, maybe charging my phone which eventually comes close to full service airlines in terms of cost.>>><<<Those amenities are literally the same as you would experience flying long-haul, full-fare Economy on a major flag carrier like Lufthansa, British Airways etc back in the 70&#39;s &amp; 80&#39;s; no screens, power outlets or adjustable headrests back then either (had to deal with cigarette smoke in the cabin as well) and the same crappy microwave-quality meals to boot.  The difference of course being that the full-fare you paid back then would have been many thousands of Euros in todays money, rather than only the 300-odd Euros that Scoot charges for the same thing.  As the man says, you get what you pay for...>>><<<wau, no headrests and non reclinable seats?! I am a budget traveller, but I could not do it without it on such a long flight>>><<<Look at the bright side 40 years ago your wifi was a skymall magazine and inflight entertainment was turbulence so its still the same>>><<<like, 5-6hrs at most. and that&#39;s a fairly reluctant 5-6hr at that. usually i try to fly delta, if not that then american. at least domestically. long haul i avoid low cost.>>><<<This is the first Airline I have seen that did not give water for free, I have been flying since early 90&#39;s, over 2 million miles worth.>>><<<I would say the best thing about scoot is they run flights from Singapore to a lot of smaller cities (at least in Asia) which would otherwise need transferring. I&#39;m more than ok to suffer a bit if flying with them saves me a day. Furthermore, I can always pay a little bit extra for the more spacious seats and all the other services, they are not that expensive given that the ticket itself is cheap.>>><<<I actually took that flight, awful expérience but the price is great>>><<<No scoot for me. Thank you.>>><<<Video is great ..NOT recommended this airline specially long tirp ..>>><<<Just try Ryanair in Europe... 5 mn is already too long. And I am not even talking of customer service at the airport>>><<<This is what you might call a flight with the bare minimum.>>><<<My maximum flight duration with LCC is 5 hours. More than that, I’ll just pass lol>>><<<Honestly, the other airlines aren’t too much better. Same 3-3-3 configuration, only major difference is in-flight entertainment and a mediocre TV dinner>>><<<Thank you for this helpful video!>>><<<Last year I flew MVD-GRU-MVD with Latam, an airline formed by the amalgamation of the erstwhile excellent Lan Chile and TAM brazil. The bare bones economy without seat choice checked or even carry on for this 488 mile trip was £505. The seat I was allocated at check in was the back row without recline or window. Thankfully, the passenger in front did not see the need to recline on this short hop. That makes Scoot seem rather good value.>>><<<Scoot changed my CEB-SIN flight without notice - making it 2 hours earlier. Got to the airpirt and no flight.  I was flying CEB-LHR on Luftansa. Amazingly,  Scoot blamed Lufthansa for the flight time change.  Luckily, I was moved to Singapore Airlines. For LCCs, I&#39;d fly Cebu Pacific instead.>>><<<I like the idea of taking out all the baked in costs and presenting them to the consumer to choose what they actually want.  I only fly like 3 hour domestic U.S. flights and don&#39;t need power, data, or entertainment.>>><<<I flew from Melbourne to Singapore a month ago and saw in the first row behind the silent area. It was the best flying experience I ever had. The other rows felt tight and I def wouldn’t recommend it.>>><<<i once did a 13.5 hour flight from KL to London on low cost airline (AirAsia), and it was actually one of the most pleasant flights i&#39;ve ever taken! ( i&#39;ve flown 225 times).>>><<<322 Euro is not a cheap price for a one way ticket.>>><<<Hot<br>Or>>><<<I might be able to sit in economy class for maybe 2 - 3 hours, max. I cannot sleep on a regular air line seat - going 13 hours in a fetal position would drive me over the edge!>>><<<3hrs>>><<<Thank you for your review of long haul flight with Scoot.  Honestly, after viewing your video, I would avoid Scoot for long haul or ultra-long haul flights if possible.  <br>     I’ve flown ultra-long haul economy with other airlines, between Toronto,  Canada and Asia. And their service was much better. Meals and charge power and In Flight Entertainment System and amenities pouch included in the price. <br>      Thank you for the videos.>>><<<Thanks for the video. Low price is perfectly OK on shorter trips, but NOT on long trips like this. Next month I&#39;m going on holiday to Thailand (from Scandinavia). Then I take Finnair down and Emirates back (economy class). My holiday already starts with the flight, which should be comfortable, and I&#39;m willing to pay for that.>>><<<All you have to do is ask them to fill up your water bottle, it&#39;s free.>>><<<Scoot is crap and Air Asia is light years ahead - I have flown both, even Scoot Biz class and it still is the poor cousin to its Malay neighbour.>>><<<There&#39;s power! only 8-9 eur.  Psftt. that&#39;s nothing man,<br><br>Food is not that crazy expensive either.>>><<<I&#39;d do this purely for the baby-free section.....>>><<<Flown Scoot many times and they&#39;ve always been reliable. Happy to tough it out and save a few hundred $$$.  Use the money you save to stay an extra couple of nights, or to do something special. Bring an empty water bottle (or two) to fill up after security, bring snacks, bring a power bank, and download a few movies/TV shows and it&#39;s basically the same as any other flight.>>><<<Did just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=270">4:30</a>h from Stuttgart to Hurghada. Kids on plane should be banned ☠️☠️☠️>>><<<As a Malaysian, that Nasi Lemak for €6.50 was a fucking crime.>>><<<Even though I travel always on budget, I am glad that I have enough money to not need to consider taking Scoot for long haul flights. Travelling on budget and being cheap (or low on money)  are 2 different things anyway 😄>>><<<That’s how we economem travel. ❤>>><<<I’m always looking at the cost but I’m way to big to wanna spend 13 hours in that seat>>><<<Now I finally get when people are complaining about airline food. That looks disgusting. If any airline would ever serve me anything close to that, I&#39;ll never fly with them again. And best of luck with getting a rest before arriving, barely acceptable level of (dis)comfort for upto 2h flights. Saving cash is good but not at any cost.>>><<<No food - bring your own.<br>No pillow - Bring your own blow up one.<br>No entertainment - bring a book and an ipod.<br>No power (unless you pay) - Bring a power bank.<br>No drink - Bring a plastic bottle and fill with water in Airport.<br><br>For Eur 300 less than any other airline I would totally do it...>>><<<I always bring my own food, water and warm items, + powerbank, so it would be worth it if i ever want to use their routes. So long as the seats aren&#39;t harder than other airlines, i&#39;m good! Actually the option of booking in a silent area is awesome, i haven&#39;t seen that before.>>><<<Just bought a one-way ticket from Tokyo to Singapore for end-year flight from Scoot. It will be my first. Bought it on discount but at around 200 SGD, with 25kg checked bags? I will be willing to bear abit rougher 6 hours for almost a third of the price of comparable Singapore Airlines flight. I always brought a powerbank, ipad mini, and headphone anyway. <br><br>And yes, I agree that Air Asia’s in-flight offerings are probably the only LCC’s food offering you can consider. Its abit cheaper too to boot. Jetstar and Scoot is basically same level for me.>>><<<Scoot is good LCC. You should have tried Jetstar in Australia, I can guarantee a day later you still in the departure airport…>>><<<Cheap longhaul travel will always fulfill a need.>>><<<Can do 13 hrs standing on my head. Anything else is a bonus..as long as it&#39;s cheap enough.>>><<<Dont forget to grab some empty bottle<br>Fill it with water at the airport>>><<<5 EUR for wifi on low cost<br>Is not bad>>><<<Lmao, paying for electricity in a plane - what in the world>>><<<I want trust this airline because they might  want you to pay for the lifejackets before they activate.>>><<<In 1993, I did 13 hours on a Qantas 747-400 from Sydney to LAX and it was the most uncomfortable flight of my life — and I&#39;ve flown in webbing troop seats on C-130s and in an F-4 and an A-7. (No padding or cushion on ejection seats.) It was like sitting on concrete and we were soon sitting on our jackets just to get a little padding. The call buttons didn&#39;t work, so we couldn&#39;t get any blankets to sit on, and for two full hours mid-flight (which was in daytime), we never saw any flight attendants even though our seats were close to a galley. For the final hour of the ordeal, there were nearly nonstop announcements about how Qantas had negotiated a quick passage through customs and immigration. We arrived at the same time as three other 747-400s, one each from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. It took <b>forever</b> to get through customs and immigration as they scrutinised each passenger&#39;s passports and visas.<br><br>After we got home, I wrote to the CEO of Qantas and told him all of the above. I got a <b>really</b> snarky reply from some underling or PR hack insisting that they had &quot;nothing to do with the customs and immigration procedures&quot; (despite all of the on-board bragging saying the opposite), that their seats were &quot;new and the best in the industry&quot;, and claiming that the number of cabin crew exceeded the legal minimum, making it &quot;impossible&quot; that none were seen for two minutes, let alone two hours. A few months later, one of the industry magazines had an article about how Qantas was replacing all of their seats with &quot;new, very comfortable&quot; models (despite the old ones being &quot;new and the best in the industry&quot;) and that the &quot;customer experience&quot; was being &quot;enhanced&quot;. I&#39;ve never been near another Qantas aircraft since and I&#39;ll <b>never</b> fly on one again. It wasn&#39;t just the way they equipped the aircraft (I love the 747) or the level of on-board &quot;service&quot;, it was the lies and refusal to admit any possibility a customer could have a valid complaint.<br><br>In contrast, the earlier flight we took from LA to Auckland was on an Air New Zealand 747-400 and it was one of the best flights I&#39;ve ever been on. Very comfortable, great and attentive service (even though it was an overnight flight), and a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. If I ever go to Australia again, I&#39;ll fly Air NZ to Auckland and get a connecting flight to Sydney, then return home the same way. <b>**</b> Qantas.>>><<<Will definitely fly scoot if the price is right.>>><<<Please note, we tried booking 2 meals and were told we cannot buy more than one meal>>><<<For me preferred mode of transport is business class.>>><<<Scoot livery is horrendous>>><<<I was told that we are not allowed to bring food on board. Can someone confirm for me if we can bring our own food. We are ordering one meal on board, but just want to know if we can bring our own food. Thanks for this wonderful video, we are going to do this and to be frank i am pretty scared. Can someone also tell me how was the seat? Hard, soft, comfortable?>>><<<Anyone from Australia - “13 hours? Hold my beer.” 😂>>><<<I absolutely loathe buget carriers and will never fly them again.>>><<<2-3 hours max>>><<<4>>><<<most people can go 13 hours without eating no problem.<br><br>problem is if you’re missing those meal windows you’re gonna mess up your body clock if you’re flying across time zones and you’ll feel the effects of jet lag even more>>><<<Well, considering that Scoot has the only direct flight between Berlin and Singapore I&#39;d risk a statement that people are using it as a necessity ;-)>>><<<I flew with Azur Air (Russian charter low cost airline) from Moscow to Varadero for 13 hours. Was terrible but considering extremely cheap price it was worth it>>><<<40 years ago we routinely flew 8 hours on airplanes without entertainment except for a few movies shown on central screens. People are spoiled today>>><<<I keep finding it counter-intuitive that budget airlines that crams the most seats on each plane uses the newest most advanced planes on the market while more expensive airlines, especially those with longer flights, uses second hand old planes they buys off budget airlines. The reason is budget airlines need to fly more flights each month, lower maintenance down times, carry more weight so need more powerful engines, and very importantly best fuel efficiency where fuel mileage per passenger counts to their profit margin and how competitively they can price their tickets. More expensive airlines carry fewer passengers and weight, less affected by fuel mileage so happy to save cost by using cheaper older planes they get second hand.>>><<<Just a warning. Scoot is notorious for delays. For many of their long distance flights, they do not fly every day. If lets say your flight from Athens to Singapore is cancelled, you may be rebooked on the next flight leaving several days later. All fine if you have a flexible travel schedule, but if you don&#39;t... you can end up getting a refund, but having to book last minute on another airline... which WILL be expensive. So you&#39;ll end up paying more out of pocket.>>><<<seats look like bus seats>>><<<“Behind door 2, it´s the rest of the economy class, where you can bring as many babies as you want.” … not in the middle of the flight… right? 😥>>><<<I always take an empty plastic bottle to the airport and fill it up airside. <br>Many people just have to choose the lowest fare and this is fine. Norwegian fares Singapore to London Gatwick were often £100 - 110 EUR>>><<<It’s great seeing economy class reviews. My wife and I just completed a twelve hour flight between Nadi, Fiji and Vancouver, Canada. These are the type of flights for which we need truthful reviews. Thanks!>>><<<Hell nah>>><<<One thing I hate when flying is to sit 13 hours with somebody&#39;s head on my lap. When this happens, I can&#39;t even open a laptop! So, I am already sold for SCOOT!>>><<<Sleep for 8 hours, that leaves 5 hours to watch a movie on your laptop. With earphones, 1 litre water bottle and sleeping pills, it sounds alright tbh. Especially for that price.>>><<<Depends the flight>>><<<Depends the price>>><<<Because the dude tortured himself for 13 hours I will subscribe>>><<<We have flown Scoot a few times and absolutely loved it! We paid A$96 one way business class Singapore to Sydney. If you can wait around a bit longer to book, they have specials on Tuesdays. I don&#39;t want to be spending bucket loads of mone on my transport to/from a destination so okay with the airline. It was comfortable, clean and best of all quiet - the cabin crew basically left you alone until you wanted something. I would fly with them again and again.>>><<<Seems kinda rough for that long of a flight!>>><<<One hour on a budget airline is crazy!>>><<<Water: take an empty 1 liter bottle with you, fill it up after the check-in at the airport.<br><br>Most airports have a place to fill up hot or cold water for free.>>><<<One simple answer: sleeping pills, I did singapore to athens and only remembered tbe landing and take off, I was window seat so no one bothered me>>><<<I love flying scoot. I usually bring a big empty bottle at least 1 litre and fill it up airside before boarding. Bring my own food, sandwiches or some bread rolls or even Mcdonalds from singapore airport (again airside). Have a power bank and many movies downloaded on my tablet with my noise cancelling earphones. With all of this for me it is just like a normal flight that costs twice as much. So get organised and put the saved $ to more spending money at your destination!>>><<<I used it between Singapore and Australia. It was possibly akin to being on a Roman slave galley.>>><<<its affordable. you get what you pay for.>>><<<The issues with water are further impacted flying sinapore to australia or au to singapore. No water can be taken onboard due to australian law and there is no free water.  Scoot promo plus fares (used to be called biz)  can be cheaper than base economy if carefully planned>>><<<What did you go to Singapore for>>><<<Tbh I wouldn’t fly with that airline at all, I have a huge distaste towards low cost airlines.>>><<<I generally do not fly lost cost carriers because they are too uncomfortable and unpleasant. Last year I flew from JFK to Singapore to Manila on Singapore Airlines which was excellent. But unfortunately on the return flights, Manila - Singapore was on Scoot. The check in at NAIA was the worst I have ever experienced. Really horrible and S L O W at some dinky little temporary counters that were a throw back to another era. The flight was also late in departing, and I wondered if I&#39;d make my connecting flight back to New York. It appears Scoot is Singapore Airlines low cost carrier or affiliate or whatever they are called. I never asked for, nor wanted to fly with them, and even though I booked Premium Economy there was no premium economy on this flight. They did serve me some non descript food and drinks which I guess they had to on  my overall premium economy ticket. I noticed not many other people were given anything at all. It was not my best travel experience and unless you enjoy being treated like an annoyance and abused, avoid them. You get what you pay for, and sometimes not!>>><<<none! economy and i don´t mix well>>><<<This video is really good.   Well done for highlighting the issue with the water.>>><<<I   like  travelling  and  your review  are  absolutely  perfect and  helpful.  In the past few  times, I had my  eyes on this  flight  company, but the flight which I  was  looking to difrences was  too  small while I&#39;ve been compared.  I&#39;m  going  give  you  like  and subscription.  I  hope  you  don&#39;t  mind  if  I refer  to your  channel on my  reviews. <br>All  best>>><<<Ok… I flew them and to be honest, they are not bad and the seat was more comfortable than I expected. I did manage to get some sleep on the flight. About the water, make sure you bring enough bottles to fill them up before boarding and may be fee snacks. I’d suggest pay a little extra to reserve Scoot Silence or a bit more extra for front row seats for more comfortable flights. I’d not mine flying Scoot again if the deal is great value!>>><<<That&#39;s not really cheap. In 2022 I flew from Singapore to Frankfurt and back with Singapore airline for 660 euros>>><<<In dem Moment als du meintest dass das Pärchen noch weiter nach Melbourne fliegt 😂 Im Hintergrund &quot;boah f*** alter&quot; das hat wohl perfekt gepasst beim schneiden 😅>>><<<My god...I&#39;d rather fly SQ in Business and get there alive. Just did so last week. Perfect. Would never ever do Scoot...🙏>>><<<Scoot ? 👎👎👎👎Sing - Syd👺>>><<<I feel like this is where most airlines are going to go and the price will remain high.>>><<<Fck me... i thought i book for Singapore Airlines but turns out it was operate by Scoot. RIP my trip to Melbourne.>>><<<just make sure they are doing maintenance>>><<<Well 15 years ago I would do it all the time. Now I would not do it for more than 4 hours.>>><<<I would have no upper limit. I’ve flown LCCs many times and either order my meals or bring my own.<br><br>Mind you, it’s not only LCCs that lack free meals. Charter companies will merrily take you long haul with nothing unless you preorder or are happy with boring snacks.>>><<<The trick is to catch the plane just before bedtime. Just sleep your way to Asia.>>><<<As a Malaysian, Scoot’s nasi lemak should be disowned>>><<<It&#39;s not recommended to travel long haul with budget airlines if you want a little bit comfort or not bored to death sitting beside a not so normal size human sitting beside you, travelled with AirAsia to Auckland, NZ with two layovers in KL and Gold Coast with no entertainment, eye mask, ear muffles or pillow and yes inflight extras as expensive... lol!>>><<<Damn. I&#39;ve just spent 5 hours flying on a single isle plane with a low cost carrier and found that to be exhausting...>>><<<Dude I flew to NZ and back for only 400 more, with entertainment and food included. But cheers for doing this!>>><<<Can Scoot mileage be linked to KrisWorld?>>><<<What on earth is “economy class”?>>><<<It looked like the plane was only a quarter full, which makes you wonder how the airline can operate such routes economically.>>><<<Definitely not for me !!>>><<<Did Melbourne to London on Air Asia. Was really good.>>><<<max. 5 hours>>><<<What is this accent>>><<<Maximum on a low cost for me is 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds.>>><<<Avoid Scoot or any Singapore or Malaysian budget airline.>>><<<For me, scoot is a hit or miss, and i agreed te food wasn&#39;t the best. If i fkew long haul with low cost carrier, my first choice will always be Air Asia, on their premium flatbed,  vor routes between Malaysia to Australia. The food is surprisingly decent. However,  scoot is still better than another LC carrier Cebu Pacific. That one is reslly brutal and only for the strong amd extremely budget minded person. They fly between the Philippines to Australia and the middle east.>>><<<Not today or ever.>>><<<I literally flew Scoot economy class from Singapore to Berlin and back in Dec 2021. 5 months later, I flew on a full service airline from Singapore to London and back. And I realised why people paid for full service.>>><<<Better not hear any complaining you choose to fly low cost for 12 hours>>><<<Just flew Scoot. As someone from the US who refuses to fly Spirit but loves Southwest I was hopeful that Scoot would be more like Southwest (which while budget seems to prioritize passenger’s comfort) vs. Spirit (which nickels and dimes you for everything).<br>Unfortunately definitely came off more like Spirit with extra for Wi-Fi (and all packages limited data amounts), extra for charging, no streaming entertainment, no adjustable headrests, and worst no complimentary beverages including water when we weren’t allowed to bring our own onboard due to the way the Singapore gate was setup.>>><<<Not bad just pop a Valium and sleep the whole way>>><<<This just highlights how much other airlines overcharge you.  Compared to the cost of the plane, maintenance, fuel, staff, etc., removing inflight entertainment, meals, etc. is not a huge saving, yet there is a huge difference in ticket price.>>><<<Choice is good. Buy water at the airport if you want to save more. I have the luxury to be able to fly comfortably - in my younger days I would have been happy for the savings.>>><<<I did SYD-SIN last summer on the same plane and it was one of the worst flights ever. Staff was rude, they didn&#39;t turn off the light for a long time despite being a night flight. The passengers were the worst: loud, rude and disturbing. But, I must say, the price was unbeatable.>>><<<This airline is the worst airline.....especially long haul ...>>><<<I flew from Phuket Thailand to melbourne. staff were helpful and polite (much beter than a lot of national carriers) Price was very reasonable. I would fly with them again.>>><<<I honestly can spend up to only an hour or two without any of those.>>><<<Just FYI, electricity on a plane is not free.  In the 787 there are separate generators that consume jet fuel to make electricity.  A regular plane has a generator section connected to the engines that takes more fuel to make electricity.  Also the electronics to convert that energy into usable passenger adds weight making the plane less fuel efficient.  That said, still a rip off.  OMG never ever heard of an airline that charges for electricity.  Heck even Southwest doesn&#39;t do that.  oh wait, they don&#39;t have it at all..  lol.  good video ;-)>>><<<Nothing about the most important - The seat comfort, width and its reclineability ?>>><<<&#39;Mystery snack pack&#39; 🤣>>><<<Always bring an empty bottle to fill up on the toilet!>>><<<It says on Scoot‘s website: „Consumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board.“ Is it not enforced then?>>><<<Honestly, you could just like take a xanax and you will be fine in the end>>><<<I did scoot gold coast to Hanoi via Singapore and it was OK... I&#39;d give them a chance to get me to Europe at least>>><<<Charging a lot for bottled water is standard on any airline where you pay for drinks. None of the extra costs mentioned would bother me if I was paying half the cost of a regular service especially as we almost all have smart devices with downloaded films. For me it’s all about seat pitch and from what I could see that looked ok>>><<<No scoot for me!>>><<<Super cheap but the food is almost un edible. So bring your own.>>><<<I flew Berlin to Singapore on Scoot in 2018. Very basic and it was delayed 24 hours. The onward flight to Melbourne ended up being on Singapore Airlines because of the delay. Essentially it is about expectations - keep your expectations low and relax - no problems!>>><<<I recently did Sydney/Manila on Cebu/pacific - its is basic - after a four and a half hour wait to check in the plane was even more late leaving. My son said this plane is only built for 330 pax but modified to take 410. I think they had removed some toilets to get more seats in. Only 3 toilets up front were working and had a continious line up and They were filthy (pee on floor etc). the 8 hour flight was absolute torcher.   I realise it was a budget flight but this lack of basic hygene is wrong.     I paid extra for front row seating but as they changed the aircraft just before we flew they just put us anywhere - I&#39;ve neveer been able to get a refund of the difference. I could go on a lot more but its useless and I will NEVER fly Cebupacific again.>>><<<nope, only star alliance member airlines>>><<<0 minutes.>>><<<How much is it to use the bathroom, and is there number 2 surcharge?>>><<<The problem is, the money you save is so small in many cases!>>><<<I am from Singapore and i LOVE this airline - this is my personal advice to everyone - Please just upgrade your seats to reclining sleeping seats (this should be the premier package that comes with a screen and charging port for you.) I do this for all flights exceeding 6 hours. Best of all some flights have screens and charging ports for you on the economy class - but i still always recommend everyone to just upgrade your seat to the reclining ones.>>><<<I feel that budget airlines are the new economy. Pretty amazing deal for long flights. If anything it should give the non budget airlines pause when they compete in terms of amenities. Honestly if you’re not into mileage points this is a solid option>>><<<Great content , lots of things can be planned for tone fair , bring a tablet , <br>Iots of water and food , most airports offer free filling so bring an empty bottle and your golden.>>><<<allowed to use the phone?>>><<<I&#39;m pretty sure the crew will give you free water from the aircraft&#39;s potable water tank supply. They certainly should.>>><<<Actually the flight was great, just the passengers are young people and travellers, so the atmosphere is different compared to a more expensive airline.  Downloaded books and videos for entertainment. Just serve a proper coffee, it is horrible. Next time I smuggle a Starbucks on board. But the price was magnificant.>>><<<This dude buys a Scoot flight and complains about a fair 2€ for a water. What a clown 🤡 would never take this flight with the obnoxious Berlin type people on board>>><<<That price for water is horrible>>><<<not even entertainment bruh>>><<<If you have to fly SCOOT stay home and save for a proper vacation! Even in young people the risk of DVTs is unacceptable, especially if you&#39;re dehydrated.>>><<<No one will want to travel in low cost budget if possible but the thing is most people dont have any choice like you do>>><<<I&#39;ve only done BNE to SE Asia on low cost carriers (JetBlah, AirAsia X). Being about 5-6 hours, they were OK... but to Europe, YIKES! I dunno either.>>><<<No way could I fly on this airline on their anything class throughout the plane. I&#39;ve known people who&#39;ve done it and say never again.>>><<<Scoot appears to be absolutely crap… several much better LCCs around.>>><<<That works out to neRly €700 return, that is not cheap, especially with the add ons , it&#39;s possible to fly return to Singapore with a recognised carrier for about the same price if you&#39;re flexible with your booking and not mind a stopover .>>><<<I never been longer thsn 9 hours, to be honest more than 6 is too much in a low cost>>><<<If I really had to go places and paying anything extra for a proper flight would harm my financial stability or prohibit me from doing other stuff I want to do at my destination I would consider it, but other than that, that&#39;s just no form of flying. I don&#39;t quite unterstand why low cost carriers are always so keen on showing the world that they&#39;re shitty. Eurowings is low-cost, too, but they at least have a primitive IFE. On a plane setting you back 200 Million Dollars, there&#39;s no reason to save the 50k they&#39;d have to pay for IFE. Make people pay a few bucks to use it or even 3 SGD per film if you want, but at least offer it. This cabin looks like from 40 years ago. There is nothing wrong with cutting costs as an airline in order to offer cheap tickets, but why not make an effort to make things as comfortable as possible without spending lots of money?<br><br>Cramp them seats in there, make me pay for food and IFE, make me pay for the electricity if you feel the need, but at least offer smth and dim the lights. Color these seats in a way I sent get eye cancer.>>><<<I would 100% fly with them! Just make sure to charge an iPad with movies before boarding, and bring my own water and food for the trip.>>><<<Would have been good if you told us the price of a comparable flight with a better carrier as I dont fly there. Otherwise amazing vid.>>><<<That looks . . . rough. :(>>><<<Great video!! I live on the east coast of Australia (Brisbane) and the nearest International airport is 15 mins from my house, so it&#39;s fairly convenient to fly a full service International airline to Asia/Americas/Middle East and beyond. Conversely, we have access to budget airlines mainly flying from the Gold Coast (1.5-2hrs by car). I&#39;ve often costed out a trip on a full service airline from  Brisbane vs a budget airline from  the Gold Coast and after the added expense on transport to the airport, luggage, meals etc the full service airline generally wins from a economic (and comfort) perspective. Takeaway points - research all prices and add ons the budget price may not be so budget after all>>><<<5 hours Else I will be bored>>><<<Honestly, I think this video would attract many more casual viewers if it was called something more catchy like: &quot;The longest low-cost flight in the world! (then the rest of the video title)&quot;.<br>Great video otherwise!>>><<<It cannot be worse than 13 hrs on British Airways economy . On one flight the flight attendant actually apologised for the cardboard breakfast they served not long before landing .>>><<<Worst looking cabin food ever, unless im dying from hunger. Their flghts notoriously famous for delays too. Again, unless its a mega sale fare or only airline to fly that desti.>>><<<The Scoot website states that &quot;Consumption of outside food and beverages is not allowed on board&quot;, so it may not be possible to bring your own. People have reported that they had actually taken their drinks away from them before boarding and that they couldn&#39;t get anything to drink on board without paying even when they said they were feeling unwell. I would never fly with an airline that treats their customers in such a way.>>><<<the silence section needs to happen in more airlines, especially the non-budget ones>>><<<Short Trips yes but on Long Haul Flights no.>>><<<I flew Scoot on SIN-SYD few years ago. They blasted the air con to the max in order to get people to pay for the blankets (and the unprepared ones were in t-shirts and shorts having boarded from Singapore). They also made constant announcements that passengers were not allowed to consume food brought onto the plane themselves, and I had to swallow my food like committing a major crime. So yeah you get what you paid for.>>><<<Scoot tends to change your flight itenaries alot>>><<<Great review. I love it when vloggers actually fly like the rest of us -- in economy.>>><<<No thanks I would rather book on a good airline>>><<<I may be poor but that&#39;s something I won&#39;t compromise... My legs and back will only allow me 2 hours at most on that kind of setting.>>><<<Euros 330 return? = Pah !! Last year I got a winter economy return London to Seoul on Air France for GBP 300. Main door seat too....>>><<<5 6 hours max, i do it everytime i enter or leave iceland there aint no fancy shit airlines comin to this country, its exclusiverly wizz air and some other cheap ass eruopeans>>><<<They lost my bag almost 1 year without any good intention to compensate. I curse them immidiate bankrupt>>><<<2 hours max>>><<<I would say on Ryanair 30 minutes 😂>>><<<Can you not just bring a refillable water bottle and get the flight attendants to refill it for you?>>><<<there are many low-cost airlines that fly now internationally that have charging ports, TVs.>>><<<Flying to Singapore on it in 2 days time. night flight so i plan to sleep as much as i can>>><<<I flight with my cousin last year to thailand with scoot (from berlin) this year we are repeating>>><<<You and a lot of commenters here seem to quite like Scoot for its &quot;no frills for the absolute lowest price&quot; approach.<br>However, what always kept me from flying Scoot is that it rarely turned out to be this incredible deal that some other commenters were lucky enough to get: Looking at a return BER-SIN itinerary for various dates this year, Scoot is always the cheapest with around 700€, but depending on the dates there are usually Turkish or Qatar Airlines flights available for just ~20€ - 100€ more. Even if you don&#39;t care about any amenities, this would be worth it just for the checked bag alone.<br>That&#39;s why to me it always seems like flying Scoot would only ever be worth it if you are flying one-way or if you need the absolute fastest connection between Berlin/Athens to Singapore.>>><<<Today i learned alot. I thought water was always free and so does socket.!>>><<<It’s the unscheduled delays and cancellations that make Scoot a gamble>>><<<More i watch more brutal it became. 😢>>><<<Im not impressed ! ( &quot;livestock transport flight &quot; )>>><<<I’ve been on this plane, it was great>>><<<Not all heroes wear capes, some document long-haul budget flights for the bros.>>><<<Max 2 hours. If i fly 13 hours I will be on 100% bored.>>><<<One I&#39;ll never fly with.>>><<<price conscious traveller here, did singapore to berlin on this same scoot flight back in 2019 and, i didnt pre order any food, didnt have any movies on my phone, i slept through the whole plane and although uncomfortable, worth the money(I believe it was under 400 SGD for a one way)>>><<<Ha ha I see you&#39;ve got an EU. How boring is that?>>><<<I would fly Scoot provided I could get an aisle seat.  Back in the day planes had virtually no entertainment except for movies projected onto bulkhead screens &amp;  audio channels piped through headphones.  People would bring books instead. I think buying the meals is a good idea because it breaks up the flight &amp; is something to look forward to!>>><<<Without IFE is one thing<br>Without IFE &amp; power to charge my devices is whole other thing<br>Need to bring a few power bank to live thru that>>><<<Are you allowed to bring own Food and Drinks on Board?>>><<<This all looks completely fine????>>><<<They don&#39;t provide drinking water fountain inside the boarding lounge in Berlin?>>><<<Food isn&#39;t up to scratch?  Blame the Berlin catering kitchen.  Food is prepared on the land side of the airport that the airline is departing from.  Food is better on Air Asia?  I would be surprised if it wasn&#39;t given that it was Asian style food prepared in an Asian country.>>><<<Someone needs to explain the economics of this to me… aren’t the biggest expenses the plane itself and the fuel?  Not the food and movies… so how does that work on long haul, then?  Especially when there aren’t more premium seats to charge for, and it’s not like they’re fitting double the amount of economy seats in there either…?>>><<<4hrs max>>><<<To be honest I think I can’t survive a long haul flight with scoot but I can survive a short haul flight since it has no tv>>><<<Flown scoot a few times, honestly the food was okay i thought. also had both the nasi lemak and mums fried rice. will need to give air asia a go to see how it compares.>>><<<Basically ,Scoot is the exact opposite from Singapore Airlines .>>><<<I avoid airlines that offer low fares, then remove amenities like power ports for the sake of recovering revenue. Also, no in-flight entertainment? Come ON! Also noted, and agree. Other low-cost carrier Air Asia has surprisingly decent food options in their Santan line. &quot;Uncle Chin&#39;s Chicken Rice&quot; is a personal favorite.>>><<<No I couldn’t do this.>>><<<Wow,those two meals looked absolutely brutally bad. Jesus>>><<<Hell, if there&#39;s an asian girl waiting for me in Singapore, I&#39;d fly a damn kite there if I&#39;d have to.>>><<<No I would not.>>><<<if the price is the cheapest by a wide margin, and it&#39;s a direct flight. i have no complaints. doesn&#39;t matter how expensive their water is, it ain&#39;t an issue.>>><<<I flew ScootPlus from Sydney to Singapore, ScootPlus provides seats that are equivalent to premium economy on other airlines, it also included entertainment, food and beverages. While Scoot may not allow babies and toddlers in the Scoot-in-Silence cabin they do allow them in ScootPlus and so we had crying, screaming, misbehaving toddlers all the way to Singapore. Overall it was an ok experience but I wouldn&#39;t fly with them again, better just to pay extra and fly economy class with a full-service airline.>>><<<Only down side is flying Boeing.>>><<<When I travel I need to travel in style. SQ Business class and above that&#39;s it. Not in hundred years I will fly such Scooty Scooby doody airline>>><<<Well, the food&#39;s cheaper than Norse Atlantic, I guess. <br><br>Also, I can&#39;t see that red artwork in the BBI terminal without thinking of those giant blood clots ICU doctors and nurses were pulling out of people&#39;s tracheas during the height of the pandemic. Gross.>>><<<Best seats on this flight are in the crew rest area 🤣 ....... Having flown AirAsiaX on the A330 a few years back, I found it to be pretty decent.<br>About 20 rows of seats for passengers over 12 years only ........ bliss 😆>>><<<IT IS SO BAD!>>><<<When you look at Scoot’s destination map, in Europe and the middle east they basically serve destinations that are too small for it to be profitable to serve with Singapore Airlines.>>><<<David, I still miss your Expectations -Met/Not Met!>>><<<To be honest, a 3-hours-flight is the pretty much for me in a LCC airline.>>><<<I think 2 euro for water is still cheaper than in many airports.Its really Good option for people travelling without add ons,No food No luggage just Good price.if You add everything the price Will be similar to full service carrier>>><<<Out of interest, having viewed your vlog, I checked Scoot&#39;s price from Berlin to Manila for my upcoming trip at the end of the year. I can fly more cheaply from Edinburgh to Manila with both Qatar and Emirates, and without the additional cost of connecting to Berlin, so this is a no go for me (thank goodness!).>>><<<I wouldn&#39;t spend more than a few hours on a low cost airline, low cost airlines are fine for short haul flights, if I&#39;m going to take a flight to the other side of the world then i want my journey to be as comfortable as possible including having food and a few beers and inflight entertainment where i can pass the time on a couple of movies, I&#39;ve read the reviews for scoot on skytrax &amp; TripAdvisor and the majority of them are negative, it&#39;s enough to put me off from flying with scoot>>><<<Book Singapore Airlines instead, they own Scoot !>>><<<I paid 750€ for a return trip in October of 22 with Quatar. So not even that much more but way more comfortable. If the flight was like 200€, I&#39;d consider it>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=432">7:12</a> Their website officially say consumption of outside food and beverage is not allowed lol>>><<<I’m flying to Sydney soon and scoot was by far the cheapest option, so yes, i don’t mind. <br>Last Autumn I took an overnight bus trip from Munich to Paris and two days later another overnight bus trip from Paris to London and I didn’t mind.

I didnt buy the ticket so i had no choice but i will NEVER fly low cost carriers ever again.>>><<<I wouldn’t.>>><<<if you have a family with small children, please don&#39;t use a budget airline...I learned the hard and painful way when I took a budget airline to Hongkong from Singapore. I end up paying more for the additional purchases than if I took full-service airlines for services that are already free. if I&#39;m alone, then yes budget airline is the way as i will be sleeping all the way through the flight.>>><<<The problem with low coast airlines is reliability. What’s their policy on if the flights delayed and you miss your connecting flight? My experience with low cost carriers is that they are risky, they can just cancel the flight and not give you your money back.>>><<<Friend with Scoots to Singapore from Sydney Australia. He said even on Scoots business the meals quality are less than normal Singapore airline economy>>><<<I would only travel on this type of plane for max. 2 hours>>><<<I assume not many people are willing to take these flights...so empty rows for your self?>>><<<I made my 8hr flight from Sing to Mel super comfortable by paying a little for an exit row, and then I brought my own food, water and phone with predownloaded entertainment, it was honestly super nice>>><<<Checked SYD to ATH for fun. Without food or entertainment for such a long flight, one-way it’s almost AUD $1,000. That is too expensive for what it is then there are the add ons.<br><br>Does Scoot offer movies using screens they provide you? Sure I’d pay. That’s what I’d like.>>><<<The longest i could take budget airlines for is max 2-3 hours. Respect that you managed to survive for 13 hours>>><<<I flew scoot from Tokyo to Sydney via Singapore in cattle class and airline, service and even seat were ok.  What was not ok was the passengers.  Hence I’ll avoid it in the future.>>><<<For the price,  I love flying with Scoot and the food isn&#39;t that bad. Scoot offers the most value for money and new planes too (747-8).>>><<<At this price is unbelievable!<br>Consider that a 9hs flight from Buenos Aires to EEUU can cost three times and the legroom be even worse.>>><<<I salute you, brother. 🫡>>><<<I barely survived a 13 hour flight in Premium economy on United. I cant even imagine having to do this>>><<<the most valuable information for me in this video is the passenger could and should bring their own water into the cabin for the long haul flight. <br>Thank you very much David!>>><<<It’s better to check on different full service airlines tbh. I paid 550€ for a return flight to Singapore from Frankfurt with saudia.>>><<<320 Euros ONE WAY? 640 Euros return.... I can find flights with decent airlines for that price anytime>>><<<its actually not bad (as compared to Airasia), but of course, its more expensive than Airasia too>>><<<the secret to surviving long flight on scoot is to pick book a timing you&#39;ll sleep super well in. I fell asleep when the plane took off and when I woke up, the plane was landing. Best flight experience for a budget airline.<br><br>Scoot business has also better seats than economy class of major airlines for similar price points. The only downside is the lack of entertainment.>>><<<Scheint ausgelastet zu sein....>>><<<Are you allowed to bring your own food on Scoot? I remember you can only consume what they sell.>>><<<Weird, eurowings is also a budget airline but has power ports, entertainment systems and free food for main meals>>><<<Stupid airline charges for power>>><<<Agree about the food; Air Asia has much better food and agree that charging to use the onboard power points is a money grab as the AC power generated comes from the aircraft&#39;s own engines.>>><<<Took that flight years ago at beginning of march 2020 from Singapore back home to Berlin😅. <br>Wonderful flight half the plain for myself for obvious reasons 🦠. Get prepared with films on your phone, own blanked and neck pillow. <br>It was way Better than my overcrowded and expensive Lufthansa flight to Singapore 5 month before. But next time I would not count  on an global pandemic to clear half the plane again 😅>>><<<nice to have found your vlog, Glad you said you get what you paid for, I Fly scoot from aust to singapore and then other asian routes, for me the longest flight is 5 1/2 hrs. So this is comfortable with out meals,movie, power . Well done doing 13 hrs  for me any long haul is with Sing air.  FYI there is free water in the toilet cabin>>><<<The money saved I can upgrade to a 5 star hotel for a week. I take that>>><<<If I was stuck in Berlin and this flight fits my schedule I will take it. Having to pay for entertainment means going back to the old days of reading a book or interacting with fellow travelers,or just sleeping. A shame about the bottled water cost but save your money for better food in SG.>>><<<A very interesting video for me. I have personally flown economy on Scoot 787s a number of times between Sydney and Singapore. It’s pretty much like any other reputable airline so I would happily fly that route again given the low price. I might even fly on to Europe from Singapore but only after a stopover.<br>In my opinion, it is inappropriate to compare the cost of a meal on a low budget carrier like Scoot and what you might pay for a similar meal in an everyday situation. It is very expensive to provide hot meals etc on planes and not doing so is how the low cost carrier can offer low fares. The more appropriate question is: what is the total package costing compared to a full service flight? Even with the egregious price for water etc, the total price for this trip is amazingly low. It’s not quite as amazing as the headline price but it’s still amazing.<br>I would also eat before getting on the plane and either fast, preorder a light meal or bring some food with me given it’s such a long flight. You can take a book, a tablet, headphones and an external battery. This will make it as good as any other economy flight. If it’s not good enough, one needs to go business class.>>><<<No, I won&#39;t fly with them. Long haul low cost? I&#39;d rather not go. I would wait and save up for at least premium economy. Those seats look awfully uncomfortable. 13 hours?! It will cost more on massages. The thought of the return journey will spoil the holiday. The meals didn&#39;t look like real food. <br>The longest low cost flight (Easyjet) I have ever done was just under 2 hours. That was about 20 years ago. Don&#39;t do low cost flights any more.>>><<<worst food!!! they changed my flight schedule without proper notification and the ticket priced also not cheap they also charged me for extra 5 kilos of luggage that i didn&#39;t even brought with me ( Athens - Singapore -Manila and returned 2022)😡😡😡😡>>><<<787 just simply the worst long-haul out of 777 and 350 period. no 787 should go 9 abreast and 777,350 should go 10 abreast either, its just toooo much.>>><<<The longest I&#39;m willing to do on a low cost airline is 4 maybe 5 tops. I am not willing to do anything more than 8 hours in economy class on any airline though>>><<<Charging for the outlet is just too far. Next they be charging to use the lavatory. I’d just shit on my tray table and close it.>>><<<i flew for 13.5hrs from sin-ber after syd-sin (~8hrs). I wasnt feeling the half of my body after all. although it was a350, the seats are the same and literally they are even worse than bus seat. besides of seating on a chair (i dont wanna call it seat) during the longhaaul flight, the lady next to me sat on the floor, put her head on the part that she is supposed to sit on and constantly hit me and invaded my space in her sleep in the last couple of hours. the worst flight exp ever! i also paid extra for seat selection in my second flight but i was given another seat in the middle. i checked if it was the same on the app and on my boarding pass. they were same but after the checkin my selection was updated on the app too so i didnt notice that mistake n update till got the middle seat rather than a window one. meals were terrible too. everything was terrible about it and it wasnt that much cheap though. air fares are very scary in the postcovid era. everybody should think twice before choosing a lowbudget airline for a longhaul fligth cuz you may regret.>>><<<Thanks for the video but for a long travel time like that, I&#39;d rather pay for business class and I&#39;m not rich btw..>>><<<I flew Zipair from SIN-NRT-LAX last year coz I missed my ANA. Love it when the price is right. Regular price is around 300USD one way. I booked the flight departing in 2 hours and it only cost me 800 I am blessed (UA/ANA wanted 4000, in economy, one way)<br>Later I flew Zip often, mostly in their biz class called Zipflat. The only complain I have for those long haul ULCCs is the water! You need to buy water even in &quot;biz&quot; class. I drink a lot, around 4L in the plane. 2 meals give me 600mL and my water bottle gives me another 500mL. I also bought a 1L water in the airport but that was still not enough but I made it.<br><br>I am going to fly real business class few days later from DPS to SIN to JFK in SG&#39;s signature super long haul route, 18.5 hours non stop. Let me see if my body can handle it. It is a challenge for both the flight and myself.>>><<<Brutally honest..NO!  I would not fly a LCC like that. Better stay at home.>>><<<I flew with scoot once in Nov 2018 jakarta-singapore and should return to base after 15 mins take off due to cabin pressure failure>>><<<For a long haul flight like this I rather pay more to feel comfortable. Not offering at least simple drinking water is cruel in my eyes.Don´t need any entertainment though. Just a comfy seat, somehow good food and water would do the trick for me.>>><<<They really push the law of supply and demand lol. They don&#39;t let you bring your own water unless it&#39;s bought from the airport, which is just as overpriced>>><<<I once regularly (weekly) flew Scoot from Changi to Xi&#39;an, China...about 6 hours each way.  That was tolerable.>>><<<3 hrs>>><<<anything above 3 hours in economy is terrifying>>><<<Id rather put in the work and take a premium airline>>><<<I guess Singapore Airlines serves the same food in the Economy, incl. in ticket price.>>><<<Despite the not very favourable review thank you for giving the real picture of your experience and of course, thank you for supporting Singapore carriers!>>><<<I&#39;d  definitely fly 46 hrs by budget airline... what&#39;s the problem... easy>>><<<Electricity on the plane is not free. It puts load on the electrical systems which in turn puts load on the generator which by virtual of being connected to the engines puts load on, to which consumes fuel.<br><br>So no, it is not free. If it is provided free it will be charged in the ticket, there will be the add issue of calculating fuel to load as it cost fuel to carry more fuel. So ya it&#39;s not that simple.>>><<<Mine is 5-7 hours>>><<<So meals ARE available, just for purchase<br>Works for me!>>><<<Get a massage and a good meal when you land with some of the money you saved.>>><<<I flew scoot fro SG to SYD - I thought they were pretty good.>>><<<People who say they’d be ok with this have clearly never flown long haul before.>>><<<17 hours from Singapore to New York on this airline will be brutal. 3 hours is okay if flying regional>>><<<Too expensive! 1.685€ Berlin - Melbourne.>>><<<Honestly — Stay far away from low-cost airline.>>><<<We managed to fly on this line from Berlin to Singapore at 2018 on inaugural flight. We paid 400€ for two return tickets in total. An got cupcake, pair of socks and dance from a cabin crew. It was reasonable but I have to agree that the most annoying thing was the water price. For a normal price I wouldn’t book the flight again. Thanks for a video. It brings back the memories.>>><<<Bro ate the mask leak without the sambal (the sauce) on the rice>>><<<Scoot sucks>>><<<I always take the legroom reviews with a grain of salt. I’m 193cm tall myself. British Airways short haul economy has a pitch of 30 inches. Even if I sit all the way to the back of the seat, my legs will still hit the seat in front of me. I think the Scoot 787 comes with 31 inches if pitch. I highly doubt that I’ll be able to do this for 12 hour on board that 787.>>><<<Scoot does exactly what it says on the box, you get a seat on a well maintained plane that will deliver you from A to B. No surprises there.<br>However, if you have a problem the email and phone systems for dealing with that problem seem to be grossly overloaded and/or under-manned. <br>Scoot&#39;s stated response time to an email complaint is currently up to 10 working days.<br>Trying to contact Scoot via phone(in Australia at least) is an exercise in frustration.>>><<<i won&#39;t anymore>>><<<I can knit or read.  I don&#39;t do much that needs to plug in, anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter.  As long as the trip takes.>>><<<Malaysia food is always better than Singapore :)>>><<<Wait, not even water is included?<br><br>I would do it if I really need a cheap flight but in most situations I really wouldn’t>>><<<Scoot sucks! Even 4 hours, Singapore to Manila and back recently. Connecting flights booked unwittingly by Singapore Air from South Africa (not cheap either).  Both flights were late, staff were inexperienced  adolescents, treated like sheep, uncomfortable. Food was rubbish.  Horrible experience as part of a long haul. Singapore has hand in this, damaging their brand for sure.>>><<<Just a shame on the price rise to even have a holiday, i was considering a holiday, family of 4 and the prices have risen so much. Just before the pandemic 2ish years ago, spent 2 weeks in Dubai, hotel with half board cost me £4700 pounds, looked up yesterday and with the same airline, dates and hotel is now £8400. Seems to be the same where ever you look.>>><<<I have a bad back so long haul LCC isn’t for me. The longest LCC flight I’ve been on is only an hour from Manila to Cebu in the Philippines. I do fly WestJet frequently on Canada to US flights but they feel like a step above an LCC carrier, (but not quite a legacy carrier) so that probably doesn’t count.>>><<<It&#39;s interesting to note that LEVEL is actually quite a pleasant way to fly.>>><<<Just went on a flight from SIN to OOL (Gold Coast Australia) but now they are suspending the route. So sad :(>>><<<Can you take your own water bottles? Are they strict about the no outside food? Are they more lenient if foods for kids?>>><<<The question at the start - for me, it depends on how much anaesthetic I&#39;d be allowed before boarding>>><<<If you pay 350 one way, that is not cheap definitely>>><<<With LCCs, it always seem a lot less worth it the moment you have to add checked baggage. It&#39;s not too far off full carrier which at least provides you with meals during a long haul.>>><<<Does anyone know what happened to the Low Cost Tickets?? When I checked just recently the prices from BER to SIN its around 900€ and higher than &quot;normal&quot; the airlines like Etihad or Qatar. Why should anyone use Scoot any longer, with no service and same price other Airlines with meals and entertainment>>><<<Flew on Scoot from Singapore to Cebu as a Singapore Air transfer. It was business class and figured in total price.  Under 3 hours.  From LAX to Singapore on Singapore Air then Scoot to Cebu.  Singapore Air is great.  Living in Washington State now Eva Air Seattle to Taiwan to Cebu. Being 182 cm tall and and 98 kg I use business as more comfortable. Don&#39;t think I could make it 13 hours on basic economy.  It is the tight seating.>>><<<really liked your attitude.  hateful are vloggers who complain about low cost airlines when they are just getting their money&#39;s worth.  self-entitled cheapskates!!!>>><<<Please make a review of US-Bangla Airlines, Novoair and Air Astra of Bangladesh. Bangladesh aviation industry is growing recently. You&#39;ve already reviewed the national flag bearer Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Please review the three private airlines next and give your opinion about their service and quality.>>><<<Anyone flown Europe to Aus? I’ve flown Scoot Biz now Scoot Plus between Singapore &amp; Australia a few times. Hubby is an aviation enthusiast (airline snob) who actually loves the flying aspect but he’s also a tall and big guy so he will only fly premium economy or business. He did he doesn’t think he can fly that long without flat bed and he just hated flying economy to Europe with Emirates even in exit rows. Which is ironic since he can sleep anytime literally standing up to board a plane or on a construction site and in the one who has trouble sleeping on planes.  <br><br>If anyone has done Europe to Aus what was it like? I suggested we break up the flight by staying in Singapore 2 or 3 nights which is what I usually like to do since I don’t sleep on planes. Stay a couple of nights in Asia or Dubai so I can have real sleep and start adjusting to time difference. I would love to know if Scoot Plus holds up against other premium economy seats. Thanks 🙏>>><<<i tried 7 hours on Scoot from Tokyo to Singapore on &quot;Business Class&quot; thinking there will be entertainment! There was 1 microwaved meal, 1 bottled 300ml water and bigger seat - not even wine if you want to purchase!! I ended up staring into blank and forcing myself to sleep, starving... &gt;-&lt; Will do it again but with my own entertainment alot of food and a bottle of wine!>>><<<I wont fly even if they pay me. Humans are not animals>>><<<Great video 📸>>><<<Nothing seems bad. First of all, it&#39;s a non-stop flight, and secondly, you don&#39;t starve for 12 hours even though you received two meals.<br>At this price, it&#39;s super OK.<br>Try to go with TAROM from Bucharest to Beirut and you will see that you pay almost 200 Euros and get a candy and a glass of water. (A 2.20 hour flight)>>><<<13 hours on a plane, what a nightmare......im tired after 2 hours.....>>><<<Hey Simply! what editor do you use?>>><<<$300ish for one-way from berlin to SGP ?  that&#39;s cheaper than local ticket on my country. 3 hours flight can cost me $150.>>><<<Ngl the livery is nice>>><<<Ye>>><<<A plastic bottle would be worth carrying to fill with water once you&#39;ve cleared security. Might save a few €!>>><<<When you say adjustable headrests do you really mean adjustable seat backs?>>><<<Charging for power is just horrid.>>><<<Dude. It&#39;s a 787 DREAMLINER, The state-of-the-art and aviation comfort, How rough could it have been?>>><<<Ruben Östlund (who wrote Triangle of Sadness) next film will be called &quot;The entertainment system is down&quot; and will portray a longhaul flight were the entertainment system crash and the passengers are left to their own devices. The plot is that without entertainment people go mad. Guess Scoot proved him wrong.>>><<<great video!!! I personally would NEVER fly on a LOW COST airline, having a comfortable flight is way more important to me then cost.>>><<<Regulations should make water mandatory in any flight. I really can&#39;t understand how the EU allows something this low.<br>You should never refuse water to anyone.>>><<<4 hours uk to Canaries or Greece>>><<<This was the worst flight ever. But I was a student and had no money, so in that regard I got what I paid for 😢>>><<<I&#39;ve tried Jetstar from Melbourne to Bangkok approximately 9-10 hrs. Basic eco without food or drinks. The worst experience ever! (Mostly from the other passengers. I wasn&#39;t aware that cheap price would come with lower quality people. No manner, loud noise, walking around like they&#39;re visiting the zoo.) Never do low-cost long haul flight again.>>><<<Hey simply aviation, nice videos :D>>><<<Well, when my sister and me travelled to Singapore in 1993, we did so without in-flight entertainment, too, because it wasn&#39;t yet a thing. They fed us, though. 🙂>>><<<I can bring entertainment by myself, using iPad. I can also bring snacks and drinks by myself 😀>>><<<Scoot is my goto Australia to Philippines airline of choice (after trying Qantas, Jetstar, Air Asia, Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific).  I do pay extra for scoot in silence, pre order meals and pack a power bank into my carry on.  The food isn&#39;t great but where else can you get the extra leg room and a guarantee of no screaming babies for a similar price?  I tried Scoot Plus and yes it&#39;s more comfortable but at 8 hours not necessary (probably not even at 12 hours),and it&#39;s a significant cost over &#39;scoot in silence&#39; where as &#39;scoot in silence&#39; isn&#39;t a great deal more expensive than economy.<br><br>My recommendation... definitely &#39;Scoot in Silence&#39;.>>><<<When aax turn around this scoot will go restructuring again>>><<<that is a nightmare no nothing no food no water no movies <br>u will go crazy>>><<<tape to the ceiling i dont care.>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot several times between Taipei and Singapore(and will be doing so again in two weeks). For short haul flights it&#39;s not that bad. Would not do so on flights longer than that. But I guess for the ultra-low-budget travellers it&#39;s a good compromise.>>><<<Do they still have the rule where you can’t bring your own food and drinks on the plane? They use to fly HNL&gt;KIX&gt;SG but they closed out after just 1 year. Not much HI locals liked the idea of not allowing food onboard unless you bought from them. Since HI is famous about plate lunches and bentos.>>><<<The lack of adjustable headrests on these Scoot 787 aircraft would be the main downfall for me - same on Air Asia A330. One of the worst flights in my life was on an Air Asia A330, impossible to sleep. Surprisingly T&#39;way Air from Korea however,  surprisingly comfortable, in seat power, holder for iPad in seat tray, adjustable headrest etc made them far more comfortable for longer journey...>>><<<Less than 2 hours Mate on a low cost airline>>><<<You got a very good price but usually it&#39;s more like Euro 450 for the sector Berlin to Singapore. Singapore to Berlin is even higher.<br><br>The final price for a return ticket is raw SGD 1330 at this moment, for a return flight in June. No Changi prison style meals, no platinum water included. Wait ... I noticed the meals they serve at Changi prison are nicer.<br>A return flight with Quatar or Finnair is around SGD 1500 at the moment. I get proper meals, videos, nicer seats, free water, etc. etc..<br><br>To my experience Scoot is often not worth it. It&#39;s only that particular leg that&#39;s  a bit cheaper.>>><<<2 euros for a bottle of water in a plane it&#39;s expensive??? In the airport or even on a rest station on the highway it&#39;s more expensive........>>><<<5 hours on Ryanair Dublin to Cyprus is about all I can handle>>><<<13 hours in economy class.  It&#39;s an overwhelming no from me!>>><<<320 euros one way? Too much. Then again airport taxes out of Germany are quite high. Before covid I paid Innsbruck-Frankfurt-Mexico City and back 540 euros return including checked bag and food and drinks.<br>If you can&#39;t afford an extra 100 bucks for a 12-13 hour flight, then you might as well stay home.>>><<<4 hours>>><<<6hrs>>><<<👍👍👍🤝🏽🤝🏽🇲🇦🇲🇦>>><<<Time in a low cost carrier? 0 hours.>>><<<7 .>>><<<300 euro&#39;s for a one way to Singapore in these times. Yes, i would pay that.  Would book the Scoot Silent most likely; a seat closest to the  Plus seats. Can live with two pre booked meals and two bottles of water bought on the airplane as well. When will the come to Amsterdam and / or Brussel?>>><<<I took this flight before fr singapore to berlin n back. It was an interesting flight n value for money. No complaints worth the money>>><<<4 hours>>><<<Unfortunately the only airline with a direct flight Singapore-Berlin at the moment…>>><<<320 EUR 1 way is kind of pricey (my Oct&#39;22 trip 420Eur return for SIA econ promo KUL-SIN-MUC, ZRH-SIN-KUL)>>><<<Watching your video after a long time and suprised to find voiceover now. Fanstastik addition!>>><<<Scoot is certainly NOT going to win any awards for its In-flight catering 🍽🍽🤣🤣>>><<<That kinda felt like always being at mercy. I mean I’m okay with having no food, movies and blankets, but that feeling, like being looked upon as peasants, having to pay for anything you touch is unsettling. And on a long haul flight, having no leg space and no reclining seat? I know there are people who hardly care about such things, and I really envy them, but its dreadful for me!!! On the other hand, its perfect for a short journey, say about 4 hours.>>><<<2 hours 45 minutes>>><<<Please do Vietjet&#39;s international economy!>>><<<This looked like the most depressing flight ever.>>><<<I checked and the seat pitch is 31&quot; which is no worse than most &quot;real&quot; airlines (and considerably better than the 28&quot; of Spirit or Frontier or the 30&quot; of Ryanair), and the width is 18&quot; which is actually better than Emirates, so yes I would fly with them if I saved enough to more than make up for the price of the food and drinks.>>><<<I flew Scoot.................once........never again>>><<<Im flying to athens in  July with scoot from melbourne via singapore , this makes my more comfortable seeing the experience great video>>><<<You act like it&#39;s a rare thing.

Nothing beyond that>>><<<I have flown Scoot from Perth to Athens, as I&#39;m 6&#39;5&quot; tall I chose Scoot Plus.  The seat was excellent but thats it.  The food and service was lousy.  Given the price I would fly with them again.>>><<<and Scoot flies to Perth>>><<<It is a budget carrier. what do you guys expect. really....>>><<<My longest non-stop flight on a budget airline for me was when I used to travel often between Kuala Lumpur (KUL), which is just a stone throw away from Singapore, to London on AirAsia. London to KUL normally took about 13 hours 30 minutes, and KUL to London was a bit longer, taking about 14 hours 5 minutes. Coincidentally, I also used to live in Berlin. Until the opening of Brandenburg Airport, Berlin really did not fly to any long-haul destinations simply because of the limitations of Tegel. When services moved to Schönefeld, which would become part of Berlin Brandenburg Airport, things got better. However, the fact that Brandenburg Airport was able to open at all was a small miracle after running into a never-ending list of logistical and financial problems throughout the more than 14 years after construction began to finally open for commercial traffic.>>><<<Height in centimeters????<br>What&#39;s a centimeter??>>><<<Power bank + smartphone ready with plenty of movies/series/books + water (after security check) and food (before security check as it&#39;s cheaper) bought at the airport is the playbook to fly low cost for more than say, 3 hours.>>><<<This is a brave man. He does these things so we do not need to.>>><<<To be fair, most of us Aussies don’t consider a 7hr flight to Singapore as a long haul flight.>>><<<Scoot is a good low cost airline to fly on, but their inflight food is terrible compared to rivals like Air Asia X.>>><<<longest ULCC flight i’ve done was 5 hours long on frontier. never again 💀💀💀>>><<<When are you uploading videos<br>   BUT GOOD JOB <br>Can you fly Peach Aviation from KIX Kansai Airport<br>Thanks>>><<<I like how it&#39;s spelled &quot;Mum&#39;s&quot;>>><<<Thank you for your vidéo and informations.

I tend to go for the scoot-in-silence section where the legroom is a bit more generous.

Only the &quot;SCOOT&quot; flights prices for two persons were good 1000 € - cheap. In the early morning of the travel day I became a travel flight information via SMS about a massive delay departure from Singapore to Berlin. The aircraft needs many hours more and I had a lot of time before I must go to the airport Berlin-Tegel (closed now). My mother was the second person. Her travel was impossible to make. After a short talk about the new situation I contacted the &quot;SCOOT&quot; hotline and told they there about the massive delay flight for a complete cancelation! Today I know it was a mistake to cancel the flights. The passenger rights say You have the chance to refund the price and flight for free (12 hours later departure after regular time and 10000 kilometers flight range).>>><<<So basically the same as Economy on most major airlines? I don&#39;t see a lot more on offer here except perhaps for in-flight entertainment which a lot of people don&#39;t need anyway as they bring their own devices. You can get water for free from the bathrooms; it&#39;s a myth that it&#39;s unsanitary. And surely the flight attendants would bring you a cup of water if you asked nicely? I find it hard to imagine why they wouldn&#39;t.>>><<<OMG you missed the most outrageous thing on that Scoot flight. 😒 People are actually prohibited to bring own meal and water on board. It stands in Scoot rules. You adviced to better bring own refreshments but it is againts the rules in fact. I cant believe how could you misslead other People so bad. 🤥>>><<<You could buy several bottles of water before taking off in Berliner airport, so you got it covered. <br><br>I always bring my own water bottle and there are many airports providing free water>>><<<Ive done the Gold Coast to Singapore three times.

And jus be bold and bring food up the plane, whats the worse that can happened, jus throw away the food.>>><<<I won&#39;t torture myself on a budget airline for long-haul flight.😄>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=87">1:27</a> Aeroméxico!!!>>><<<I live in singpore>>><<<I fly Scoot around the region and following our recent debacle with SIA in Frankfurt I wish I would have known about BER Scott to SG. But under normal circumstances this is an absolute no-no, regardless of whether I fly solo or with kids.>>><<<Having recently flown from Melbourne via Thailand to Berlin and back in premium economy (with a disability and chronic pain) on a regular service…. It was so difficult for me to move/walk for 4 days after flying…. I have made the decision to go business class in future. But then with disability it’s not really a good choice to try and go cheaply as I ‘pay’ physically and then wasted hotel time when I get to my destination… but I do have many friends who do use scoot services to travel cheaply.>>><<<Flew 14 hours before on a budget airline on Airasia. Paid for two meals.>>><<<I&#39;d gladly take that offer.  As long as have a window seat everything is fine with me.🐀>>><<<At Singapore airport you go through security with a empty water bottle there is a bubbler at the boarding lounge to refill your water 💦 bottle before boarding the plane ✈ to Sydney and have a good feed at the terminal at Singapore plenty of food options  !>>><<<thank you for the efforts, I guess I will stay with the traditional airlines, that’s way too much to handle for such a long haul😅>>><<<I’ve flown Scoot a lot last year when I was based in SG for work. The flights to Seoul were definitely challenging (~6 hours) but the shorter ones were totally fine.>>><<<That Nasti Lemak looks a bit average ngl>>><<<I went from Perth to London non stop on this plane via qantas I loved every minute on cattle class, had mum by my side I’m 6ft3 n I still made 16 hours lol>>><<<What about royal air morocco ?>>><<<4 hours lmao>>><<<I flew Scoot from Athens to Singapore and was also taken aback with the water issue. It seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen. That alone will prevent me from flying Scoot long haul again. For short haul, they&#39;re great. But never again for long haul.>>><<<A real budget traveler will take an empty water bottle or two through security and then fill it after security from a tab for free. One caveat: only works in countries where you can safely drink the tab water.>>><<<NGL the leg room already sold me on the 787-9.>>><<<Did this flight to Sydney in December. €1600 return inc. checked bag. Total rip. So many babies and those add on prices have also risen.  They don’t allow you to bring your own pot noodles and charge hard for hot water. <br>This was the best value flight going though so had no choice.<br>Before Cövid it was luxury flying via china for €700 return.>>><<<In April 2012 I&#39;ve flown WAW-MCT-HKT on 737 from EnterAir. We had to refuel at MCT but without leaving the plane. Never again.>>><<<Flew on TUI UK 788 from UK to Langkawi in Malaysia in Economy. It looks like a bit more room with 300 passengers and food and drinks were included. It is a long way but at least we had a cruise to look forward to.>>><<<I want to fly Scoot from Singapore to London.>>><<<Nope, I won&#39;t take Scoot , Air Asia if I can unless no other flight to my destination and for no more than 5 hours. No thank you.>>><<<When you are young and fit its no problem to travel this way - 30 yrs ago I used to fly to Aus from the UK in economy in the back of old 747&#39;s - on occasion you would get the middle seat, no recline (against the rear bulk head) and as a non smoker but in the smoking area and with no ipads or mobiles etc.. For good measure I prob paid £4000 in today&#39;s money.. Still I enjoyed it. Modern planes and 10% - 20% of the price shows progress..>>><<<13 hours bro respect 👍>>><<<I guess one can save even more by bringing through security an empty bottle and fill it on the toilet. I don&#39;t think BER has free water fountains. However, this is all disgusting. Who knows what this airlines pay their staff.>>><<<I&#39;ve lost my Lugage. My flight was from Singapore to Berlin last year Juli 2022. It took about a month and seventeen days to receive my Lugage back. I&#39;ll never ever take this airlines anymore in the future.>>><<<believe it or not, my worst flight was with swiss from zurich to bangkok last year in june, seat 44. never again. a sardine in the can has more space.>>><<<I tried this once on a 9 hour flight from DXB to MNL. I am ok with no food and no entertainment but what killed me was the inability to recline the seats 😢😅>>><<<In economy I wouldn&#39;t do an 3 hours flight so imagine 13 hours... it a no no for me!>>><<<I did british airways Nagoya to heathrow many years ago, ever since have rated BA as a low cost carrier.  Now always use JAL or ANA>>><<<My longest LCC was 8 hours from Singapore to Sydney by Scoot. I was okay with it. Not sure if i am able to do 13 hours or not. lol.>>><<<Eh just buy water at the airport after security or just bring an empty bottle and fill it in the toilet.>>><<<the point about water is valid to a degree, are you sure there was no way of asking for tap water - I know for a fact you can do this on other budget airlines. Also water bottles exist>>><<<only € 2.- for a bottle uf water <b>laughing in swiss</b>>>><<<I&#39;d rather pay extra on regular long haul airlines than less on crappy cheap budget airlines. Don&#39;t even fly Ryanair or similar in the UK 😡>>><<<If you want to sleep on a flight for a longer period then no meals is a big plus. No crew to wake you up all the time with food at times which don&#39;t make any sense (neither from where you departed nor where you&#39;re heading to).>>><<<i flew the norwegian to gatwick on norwegian air. very pleasant. so much better than scoot.>>><<<I had a flight from Seoul to Singapore, Singapore to Amritsar, India. Total 12 hours of flight, was not bad though>>><<<Bottled still water costs 9 euros per litre in most average swiss restaurants on the ground.>>><<<Scoot doesn&#39;t offer on the 787s  any live tv channels or possibility to stream movies on your phone. But (and at least before covid), they used to have a number of tablets with movies &amp; episodes to rent for a fee. It was on TXL - SIN about 4y ago. Dunno if they still offer it nowdays. I just had my phone full with Netflix downloads. But there were at least 5passengers who prefered to rent them.>>><<<So your main complain is a 333 ml water bottle at 3€ 🥸>>><<<AirAsia&#39;s meals are tasted and selected by the owner. The menu has been like that since 15 years ago. I love traveling with them.<br>But Scoot (Tiger Airways) and its affiliates? Meh... not the worst, but also not the best. At least it is better than Cebu Pacific. The plane being 787 also immensely helps. The low cost A330 is extremely awful, and they squeeze you with 28&quot; pitch.<br>In general, avoid taking long haul flights from and to notorious begpacking countries. Going from Berlin to world&#39;s most expensive city like Singapore on budget airline is like walking to a Ritz Carlton - it doesn&#39;t matter and you won&#39;t experience the worse part of flying long haul budget airline - &quot;the crowd&quot;. Sometimes people think crying children are annoying, but it is when you are trying to sleep. When you have audio / video distraction, crying children are minor nuisance. However, poor hygiene begpackers and their youthful emotions - oftne times created much more concerning issues.>>><<<Longest I did was 9.5 hours on Scoot from Sapporo to Singapore. Not that bad until you start running out of water..>>><<<This plane used to fly to Athens before Dingapore for less than 80€. If you are a tall person, 2 hours was ok flying on Scoot, but 12 could be unfathomable. Also not that good food back then, but it was interesting as an experience.>>><<<Paying 300€ as single flight doesn&#39;t even seem that good of a deal. I spent around 660€ from Stuttgart to Singapore via a Transfer in Istanbul for the full flight via Turkish Airlines with unlimited Water and free onboard Meals in basic economy>>><<<Scoot sold me a ticket, then cancelled it when I turned up at the airport. They have no staff, everyone is a contractor who knows nothing. Their  maintenance is probably as good as their customer service.>>><<<2 hour. did it in china with spring airline.<br>i can still accept 2 hour, not any longer<br>to me, for any flight longer than 10 hours should be booked in buisness class, thats why my family do at least>>><<<honestly wouldnt really mind it cuz i would just bring my switch or a book to read in the mean time or just sleep and i actually would get the power outlet to charge all my stuff in case anything happens, but great video nontheless.>>><<<If its REALLY cheap and the gap is really Big between this flight and a more regular economy one, maybe, but just for the comfort and features included with other companies (and mostly free features...), I&#39;ll go with another company than this one (even if there is 2 flights)>>><<<Technically it does cost them something to provide you with power through the socket: a bit of fuel. Because that power needs to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is the engine generators.>>><<<Wasn’t this channel about silent reviews with captions and steadi-cam style shots? I liked the style better, this is way too in your face...>>><<<I travelled SYD-TXL in 2018 with Scoot. By the time we’d added on meals, seat selection, and luggage (we were moving, so packing light was not an option) it came out pretty much on par with any other airline cost-wise. Service was average (not bad, but not excellent, no surprises) and in general it got the job done. Nothing to complain about other than everything being…average. Main reason I wouldn’t fly with them again is that for the same money long-haul you get an overall better experience, or close enough that paying full-service is worth it just for not being so…average. If short-haul no-frills is all you need though, Scoot will get the job done well enough.<br><br>Absolutely not “long-haul Ryanair” though, as someone said. Ryanair is built around explicitly screwing you while being <b>just</b> good enough at the bare-bones stuff that people can still convince themselves that it’s worth the suffering. All states quite publicly by its owner, who makes no secret as to the contempt he has for his passengers. Scoot, on the other hand, is just an airline trying its best at the budget end and mostly succeeding. I’d rather walk than give one cent to the tossers running Ryanair.>>><<<Denying adjustable head rest is just cruel. <br>Turning off the electrical outlets is ridiculous. <br>By IATA rules, airlines are obligated to serve you water for free, by the way.>>><<<So I was about to fly from Berlin to Singapore in Jan 2023 and I was ready to get thecheapest tickets, since I was on a very tight budget. To my surprise, at the time of booking in Dec 2022 the cheapest option was not scoot, but AirFrance (600 EUR to and back, in comparison to 800 EUR to and back for scoot) with a nice layover in Paris, normal recliner seat, two meals etc. I seriously don&#39;t get how scoot is a low cost, if it costs at least 200 EUR or more than a regular airline.>>><<<Huh... 330 euros is still half of my salary 🙄🤦‍♀️>>><<<Scoot on the 787 is a fantastic experience at an amazing price. The 787 is a far superior flight experience than a 777 or A330 or worse a 737. You get heaps of choice of seats from rock bottom pricing which of course will have less leg room to a very reasonable extra leg room quiet area and usually very affordable scoot plus. Scoot runs a very reliable network of flights. You can buy food onboard or before you fly at reasonable prices, it’s easy to choose your luggage requirements, wifi is onboard and you can also buy drinks. If you can’t organise yourself to bring your own entertainment or food that’s on you. Power is available in the seats for a fairly low fee, many planes have no power at all. The ability to buy what you need means you can fly for as cheap as possible or add on what you need. Couldn’t be more easier.>>><<<Max on LCC for me is 4.5hrs.<br>And yeap airasia is better than scoot.>>><<<Nah thanks, I&#39;d rather have a stopover and pay $100 more and fly with Turkish Airlines instead...>>><<<Next level of payment - for seat, for toilet, for food delivery (you pay for food but not for delivery?), for smile?>>><<<If you don&#39;t have much money you don&#39;t have much choice.<br>Yes I always look forward to the curries on AirAsia .>>><<<11 SGD isn’t a lot of money because I am from Singapore and a lot of stuff is expensive so 11 SGD is not that much money>>><<<done 7 hrs before, not again>>><<<I tried this airline before and my best advices are :<br> ✅ get an empty bottle so u can fill it after the security process ( i got for me a bottle of 1.5 lts) <br>✅ buy an hamburguer or sandwich ( 3-5 euros ) in the waiting area ( u can eat it in the airplane ) and buy packaged snacks ( u will feel full )<br>✅Bring ur laptop or ipad with downloaded movies from netflix or amazon and bring ur own earphones.<br>✅Bring ur portatile charger.<br>✅ If u are below 175 cm u wont feel any problem with the seat.<br><br>Services is nice ( i expected a really bad service )<br><br>Good luck 🤞>>><<<will mot fly scoot had 3 very bad experience being overcharged forvsub standard service>>><<<Have flown Scoot a few times in various classes.  Honestly, if the price is right, I would go for Scoot.  Again, I only fly no more than 8 hours.>>><<<Dude that’s the like the demo aircraft they bought from Boeing and “were like yeah this is good enough”>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot Silence twice in Sep 2019 and Sep 2022 on the SIN-SYD route. I expected to pre order food, or pay $$$ on board, a little preparation goes a long way if you fill up a water bottle after security. Compared to my onward journey on BA economy, I have to say the Scoot air cabin staff are way more customer focussed than their counterparts. Nothing is ever a problem. I&#39;d defo recommend Scoot for flying on a budget.>>><<<In 2018, we flew Scoot from Manila to Athens via Singapore for less than USD 600 round trip per person. No food, no bags, just seat selection. I&#39;d personally rather fly a full-service airline for that long a flight (especially if I need to bring bags), but if I just need to get from point A to B and I can one-bag the trip, I&#39;d gladly fly them again.>>><<<Bruh I took this route tokyo-singapore-berlin it wasn&#39;t even that bad and plan on doing it again in few months. So I brought some snacks prior to boarding and bought a drink on board. So tell me what are you getting on a full cost carrier that you aren&#39;t getting here?>>><<<Excellent review! Will fly Scoot definitely>>><<<Well for me I fly scoot very often and it’s normal and not bad for a 3 hours flight from Singapore to Thailand, I just booked a flight in scoot to Thailand and flying scoot is cheap and excellent, why do everyone keep on hating cheap airlines and prefer expensive ones, there are very minimal difference between cheap and expensive airlines>>><<<Can I go also manila>>><<<There was a Low Cost Airline, PEOPLExpress, based in Newark New Jersey they started service April 30 1981 and merged with Continental February 01 1987 they flew Boeing 727-200 Boeing 737-100/200 and 747-100/200 they flew the 747s to London Gatwick and Brussels and on Transcontinental flights I flew them quite a bit they changed for onboard services fifty cents for sodas juice coffee tea peanuts brownies etc snack packs for $6.00 on Transcontinental and International flights the snack packs were more substantial their 747s had first class (they called 1st class premium service) I believe they did show a movie on their 747 flights they charged $3.00 per checked baggage and carryon no charge>>><<<Even Air Asia if from Malaysia cheaper as cost of fuel still subsidised by govn <br>Thai Air Asia flight &amp; food more expensive to Malaysia AA.>>><<<I dont mind paying for food and I can bring a book or Switch for entertainment.  As long as it&#39;s a widebody, I think I can handle it.>>><<<Tried with this flight at Feb, good flying experience, as I bought many many many Wi-Fi coupon 😂>>><<<Thai Smile Airways for 1 hour was great. They even gave a bottle of water, a snack sized sandwich, and coffee or tea. I will consider them in the future and if you upgrade you get access to the Thai Airways lounge.<br><br>As for IFEs, I can survive without if need be. I remember when you had to bring a newspaper, magazine, or book with you if you wanted entertainment.>>><<<Scoot is ok for its price but my problem with them is they are never on time. 13 hour is way too long.>>><<<I fly with them before C19 3x From Berlin to Bali, its very cheap last time, around 400usd two way. I bring to backpack instant food MANA and shaker and thats all 😀 watter i was take in toilet wastaffel and done 😀 because they menu is crazy overpriced.>>><<<I fly their 787-9s on Asian mid haul flights all the way before the pandemic, and started again recently as they resumed their 787 services, usually with paid seat upgrades (not exactly tall but my knees are bad).<br>Since most mid hauls in Asia are flown using A32Xs, the 787s are a huge upgrade for me. (don&#39;t get me started on the A32Xneos, it only saves money FOR THE CARRIERS, not for us. If they&#39;re so efficient like the Airbus ads say, why aren&#39;t the tickets cheaper??)<br>Not to mention the narrow body low cost mid hauls aren&#39;t exactly cheaper than Scoot&#39;s 787 offerings. Scoot&#39;s Asian mid haul prices are still extremely competitive compared to full carriers in Asia.<br>But, long haul is a whole other story and I definitely recommend people fully understand since 3-5 hrs and 13 hrs are totally different.<br>I would consider it, but just like the summary, &quot;You get what you pay for&quot;.>>><<<No thank you.  I will only fly on proper airlines.>>><<<Brutally Honest....yes Shit on the sky . I will never pay a dollar for this crampy Flight.>>><<<No thanks. I just couldn’t face it. Appreciate your sacrifice though!>>><<<Modern Sadistic Torture.>>><<<Just checked LHR to Singapore (31Mar) and Singapore Airways was CHEAPER than Scoot! What a mess.>>><<<Not so different than flying Qatar (Airways) to Cape Town on their 777 recently, where the food and drink offering was poor on their cramped 777.<br>Give me a window seat and timely water/coffee/wine and sandwich and I&#39;ll be just fine. Power provision could be an issue, but forewarned I&#39;d be able to make it with spare batteries including laptop. But really, water is surely a human right and shouldn&#39;t be charge for anywhere.<br>You failed to mention the seat recline situation. How was that?<br>Based on your review, I&#39;d say its doable for me. So thanks, will check it out!>>><<<Faultless review. I agree about the water. That is a bit rich. Is there a water bubbler available to refill water bottles on Scoot? Other airlines have them. As an Aussie when Scoot have a sale it is deadset the cheapest way to get to Europe by a huge margin so we&#39;ll definitely be trying to put up with the discomfort the next time we go. Great review, thanks!>>><<<Never, never never never. I’d rather pay more for Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines.>>><<<Any ideas what small camera to bring to film a flight>>><<<I recall also having the Mum&#39;s Fried Rice on a Scoot flight from Singapore to Cebu (approx 4 hours) and I recall it as being the worst airline meal that I ever had.<br>Scoot airline is really a low cost airline and I could not imaigne going on a long haul flight with them. <br>I recall from my one flight with them that the aircrew was running around on the flight with no idea on what they were doing and which customers asked for service>>><<<Thank you for the review. <br><br>Perhaps don&#39;t start the video with &quot;Then this video is not for you&quot; as it might put people off actually watching it. <br>People might change their minds on low budget/long haul after seeing the video, or if they have never flown long haul, it might help them decide what will be best for them.>>><<<Thank you, but not thank you. <br>I would prefer to pay a little bit more and pause in the middle of the journey. I can think of Turkish, Emirates or Qatar, for instance.>>><<<I could never fly 13 hours at any price.>>><<<My partner and I flew from Melbourne to Athens return for about $650 AUD each (~ €410) including seat selection. We brought empty bottles than we filled after security and brought lots of snacks and a tablet with us. The cheapest alternative flights that didn&#39;t involve 2+ connections at the time were close to 3 times the price.<br><br>On the 787-9 used between MEL &lt;&gt; SIN, there are 12 or so seats that have extra leg room and an adjustable head rest for the cost of standard (cheapest) seat selection which are well worth the cost if available.>>><<<Auf gut österreichisch<br>„Do kunnt‘st mi Kasn“.<br><br>Sowas tu ich mir nicht an 😄>>><<<Wow. I&#39;d fly them short distance only. That looked brutal. Thanks for taking one for the team>>><<<I flew Scoot (flight no. TR 611) from Singapore to Bangkok one weeks ago. The tray in-front of seat was never cleaned or sanitized, I was seating near the last row and the toilet smell was leaking even though the toilet door was closed. Its a really awful experience>>><<<i think the bottled water has to be 330ml as it needs to fit into their cart, standing upright. But i do agree that $3 for a bottled water is pricey especially when it is not branded water.>>><<<Amazing how they turn it around so quickly for another flight of 12hours>>><<<It&#39;s never worth it to fly Scoot. Will only take Scoot if the flight is less than 2 hours>>><<<Good God! I would never fly that distance on a shitty budget carrier like that. What a really unpleasant experience that would have been. I guess you get what you  pay for…..>>><<<I would fly on a LCC on this route; AMS-LGW with easyJet (45min). No LCC on longer flights for me.>>><<<great video but really sounds scary :D u did awesome!>>><<<i flew from Berlin to Baltimore with PlayAirlines  no USB no Media or wifi ....fortunately i had my powerbank with me and a lot of movies (Netflix Offline) 😁>>><<<I nearly accidentally flew on scoot. $2000 AUD to fly 8 hours to Singapore from Melbourne, on Scoot. Outrageous. Thank god I spotted it, Singapore Airlines trying to cram Scoot into people that are actually booking Singapore Airlines.>>><<<We maybe nice, but we are brutaly true>>><<<For those who love getting charged for 4$ for a small cup of water from scum bags who scan and take your water preflight. Rude staff.  Was the last option but NEVER AGAIN!>>><<<Connection from SIN to Melbourne may be on SQ rather than Scoot itself.>>><<<Nope..I don&#39;t think so..even flying single aisle plane with full service for 2 hours trip is a no no to me if I can avoid it .but unfortunately it is the reality now most airlines now use single aisle planes for medium haul. In Malaysia I did fly AirAsia for domestic trips but that&#39;s only 45 minutes flight.>>><<<Sorry---not sure what your food standards are--but aIR asia WAS NOT better than what you described on scoot.  At least on short-haul-pre ordered meals.(and there too, water is that tiny bottle---and air asia--not sure if they even gave cookies w/the meal(i think just water.)>>><<<Very nice onboard report 😀 <br> Greetings from Japan 👏>>><<<Never had a bad flight experience with Scoot. Between Australia and Singapore.  BUT of course it&#39;s a lot less shorter than flying with them to Berlin.>>><<<Inspite  of being low cost airlines. Scoot service is quite satisfied , but regarding the meal I felt that airlines need to improve a lot . Recently flew frm Phuket to Singapore and it was a good trip.>>><<<I get that it’s an ultra low cost airline but being Singaporean, having no food or meals and bring 13 hours, it i was flying with them I would expect a bit more (and you have to pay for the plug socket)>>><<<Scoot in summary, a total disgrace to Singapore airlines 😅>>><<<Bro i never went 13 hrs but i took that plane tho>>><<<What ever the airline, longer than 5-6 hours becomes bothersome for me. 12h on a full budget carrier isn&#39;t fun.>>><<<13 hours flight without food or drinks,no entertainment,oh man,it&#39;s torturous, if we take 2-3 hours flights on a low cost flight that&#39;s fine, but for more than 3 hours, you must look for a plane that&#39;s a bit tolerable>>><<<Never buy the tomato chicken ragout from scoot pre ordered meal. Had terrible experiences and family member who had it fell sick for a few days.>>><<<Wow>>><<<I Flew on one they crammed as many seats as possible don’t even serve water even if you are dying>>><<<Flew Scoot from Melbourne to Singapore during COVID in December 2021. Flights were empty and literally you can lie down on seats.>>><<<Charging passengers to use even power outlets?!?!? No thanks.>>><<<Headrest covers look awful>>><<<i feel the not-so-good quality of nasi lemak was there just to irritate the Malaysians xD <br>joke only, dun take it too srsly>>><<<Where is your strange English accent coming from?>>><<<Not more than 2 hours.>>><<<When I searched trip reports I always see Simply Aviation up top on the list hopefully someday I could be up top too.❤from Malaysia>>><<<Fantastic value. Take your own snacks &amp; water, small blanket and wear more comfortable pants…not denim jeans. Thank you for the insight.>>><<<I did this annually ever since the service started, no issue at all, its a sleep all way journey, I did not even ordered meals. Board, read, sleep, wake up, arrive in Berlin. Same as return.>>><<<LOVING the new intro in the latest Brutally Honest episodes! Fantastic video as usual!>>><<<Have flown Scoot Singapore to Sydney &amp; back a number of times, including their second ever flight. Pay the extra for Scoot in Silence. They are fine, service was good. There short haul flights are not nearly as good.>>><<<My only objections are the charges for power and water. Is water poured in a cup at least free?>>><<<Personally this is a no for me, I don’t think I could do an ultra long haul on a budget airline mainly due to the leg room (I’m 6ft3). My longest low cost is 3 hours from Düsseldorf to Manchester during my 2018 study abroad. My longest in Regular economy is Milan MXP to Montreal YUL which is 9 hours and it was tight.>>><<<I would try Scoot Premium 3+2+3 upfront.>>><<<Air Asia is much better>>><<<I have a similar route for June, but premium economy with Singapore.<br>Lisbon - (via Germany) Singapore and 4days after New Zealand.<br>I will be able to try the New Zealand Skycoach, but unfortunately de flight back from Singapore to Frankfurt the A380 was replaced by a 777...and I specifically booked to catch the doubledecker...but well. <br>Let me know if you want me to make some clips ahahah 🤣😂<br>Thanks for the clip!!>>><<<I once travelled on Scoot. Undoubtedly my worst flight. I boarded the flight early and very thirsty. Having never traveled on such flight, I casually asked the crew for water only to learn it was paid. Surprising but I said ok, give it to me. The crew then responded that beverage facilities only open became at cruising altitude. I thought I could board off, get water from terminal and come back only to be told that I won’t be able to board back. So there I sat for 2 hrs, thirsty AF. Finally bought water only to be handed a 300 ml Tetra Pak of water. Views outside the window were nice though.>>><<<Its not bad when you take into account the stop over times. I spent 10hours in Toronto airport which was a horrendous experience going to Lisbon from Halifax which took over 26 hours....a total disgrace.>>><<<I&#39;ve literally just booked a ticket from Athens to Taipei via Singapore with scoot! Looking forward to it! I had a thought, with many of the passengers taking less luggage than usual (often only hand luggage), less people eating, no entertainment system, would this flight consume considerably less emotions than standard long haul?>>><<<I believe Scoot is the low-cost brand of Singapore Airlines? Let me put it that way: Next week I am getting 60. Nowadays, I can afford booking Singapore Airlines at least Premium Economy. But I am an old fart now, made good money in my life. When I was 25, wishing to explore Asia, I would have been glad having something like Scoot, bt that was way before Ryanair changed it all. However, when my son, now in his twenties, recenently travelled to California from Germany, I fronted the 1500 euros to buy him a premium ticket on Lufthansa. There is some limit to all, and Scoot is not an option. But I fully understand there are a lot of people around which simply cannot afford Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines. Good luck to them surving such a flight>>><<<So what? I flew SQ 12 hours before the days of in-flight entertainment on a 707. Literally the same experience with a 3 course meal>>><<<Scoot also flies from and to OOL (GoldCoast)>>><<<No way in hell would I ever get on that flight 🙄 Looks absolutely horrible>>><<<Maximum 4h hours without anything>>><<<I look at the food not nice and water it&#39;s expensive>>><<<If I had to, or it was way cheaper than a standard airline... then, YES!. <br>Given yr able to take yr own food and drink supplies, this makes a better yes.>>><<<The price also doesn’t look right - I can get full service carrier via a transit airport to have similar price. AirAsia food was amazing when I first tried - also pre-ordered at a good price I clearly recall>>><<<Last year I got this flight for 230€ in total for both directions. Berlin to Bangkok with a short stay in Singapore. Was fine for the price, but not for more money>>><<<Is this still commitment or already masochism 🤣?>>><<<I went on Swoop Airlines Boeing 737-800 from Alberta Canada to Cancun Mexico, it was 5 hours and 30ish minutes, that’s my LONGEST low cost airline flight.>>><<<Scoot has the most unpleasant-looking, pricey, questionable food I&#39;ve ever consume on a flight.>>><<<12 hours you will never get back>>><<<Bro , can you try new route by Batik Air Malaysia from KL to Melbourne with 737 max>>><<<Eur 350 vs EUR 2600. So figure it>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=160">2:40</a> - Scoot also flies to Coolangatta (OOL) which services the Gold Coast.>>><<<Norse from Berlin to the US is the maximum>>><<<I miss the old Tegel airport. Sure the new Berlin airport looks flashier but it&#39;s not as cozy as the ol&#39; Tegel. Oh well, at least there&#39;s the mega-airport in the German capital of Frankfurt!>>><<<4 hours>>><<<I seen this company on tik tok and there was clouds in the damn plane😂>>><<<WAIT. You have actually changed the intro and started talking instead of subtitles?? Looks like I haven’t seen your videos for a long time..>>><<<Thanks, I not book at all. I be very close to book a trip to Bangkok via Singapore, but never with bullshit Air Scott>>><<<weird concept. If you book everything you are over 1000eur in may, singapore airlines charges 876 for the same dates.>>><<<Good 👍>>><<<Flew from Singapore to Tokio at the beginning of Feb this year with Scoot.<br>The overall experience was ok, but from Singapore to Tokio, Scoot osnt that much cheaper than e.g. Singapore Airlines, next time i&#39;ll consider them instead.<br>But as someone who flew quite a lot with Scoot i can say especially on short to medium haul flights the experience is quite good for what you pay.>>><<<We are already booked to travel from Singapore to Berlin, Premium Economy.  You are quite right as I too feel I don&#39;t need games and movies.  A book and a good rest is more than sufficient for me.  Again, next  time I would probably travel Economy, no babies section! Thanks for taking the time to enlighten travellers about Scoot.>>><<<Idea : trip report HiFly>>><<<I loved that when you Mentioned Karachi while flying over and shown the beautiful night view of city . Lots of Love from Melbourne Australia. I&#39;m from Islamabad Pakistan but living in Australia now. Also good to see scoot flights experience as I&#39;m flying to Europe by same airline  in May with my family. I got unbelievable deal for whole family tickets. Appreciate your effort. ❤️>>><<<Scoot is the worst and most cramped without any leg room at all. Even the lavatories are designed for micro-size people! Don&#39;t fly Scoot unless you&#39;re below 5ft. Most horrible experience in flight!!!>>><<<I flew that exact route once, and then connected to Sydney. While the price was great, I hope to never have to fly Scoot again. It&#39;s the worst service I ever had by far, and I also was very annoyed by the price of water and power outlets and lack of entertainment  😂<br>I can handle all that on a short flight, but in these very long haul flights these little details make it a very unpleasant experience.>>><<<Pure water - ok, gluten free - ?, vegan - ?, halal - ?>>><<<Wären noch deutlich mehr Berlin-/BER-Videos möglich und häufiger/regelmäßiger?:)>>><<<......REALLY GOOD REPORTAGE..&quot;...THANKS........👌>>><<<3 hours max>>><<<I would always fly low cost, however i wouldn’t consider it on long haul flight. My most recent was on Wizzair between Abu dhabi and Vienna. Scoot isn’t bad either. I tried them before from Chennai to Singapore>>><<<Glad to see you&#39;re back with more Brutally Honest videos! <br>Quick question, do you do all the animation yourself (maps/intro etc). Looks awesome!>>><<<Seeing a heavy Dreamliner performing the steep turn just after takeoff in Berlin is just awesome... Great views! :D>>><<<&quot;No babies class&quot; is an amazing feature>>><<<I will not fly over an ocean in a 17&quot; seat.  It&#39;s business class or nothing.  I cannot afford to buy business class tickets, but I have mastered the mileage game, so my international flights are always free.>>><<<13 hours flight without in-flight entertainment? And no USB charging?<br><br>If I can&#39;t bring a few power banks with me I would probably be bored to death.>>><<<I flew Singapore Airlines First Class Suite to Frankfurt in January. I had a little more leg room...>>><<<Had to catch 2 scoot flights from Vizag to Manila, a 737 and a 321. My god it was the worst time I ever had to spend... Cheap, sure but the quality was atrocious. Would never fly them ever again and not just that, they charged me exorbitant fee for my bag being 3kgs overweight.>>><<<Water should be a basic human right.>>><<<A long time ago I flew London to Sydney Australia return on Air Asia X. I bought a very cheap Blackberry Playbook for the flight and a new Jack Reacher book. I&#39;m 190cm (and about 15kg lighter) , the trip was alright. Not really that much worse than other long haul economy flights. These days the only part of the plane you would get me in long haul would be the premium part or the extra leg room seats. I just flew Ryanair 4hr35m tenerife to Manchester and they would not let me book extra leg room seats as I was travelling with my children. I reckon I am fine for 3 hours of that crampedness. Any more is just too much for me these days.>>><<<Just no.>>><<<Did it back in 2018. It was brutal. On the way back I paid more for the quiet section. My row was empty so I was able to lie down and get quite a good sleep.>>><<<What da hail! You have to pay a holy dime to stay hydrated on Scoot even when they don&#39;t allow water past security! Is this how a budget airline makes you pay more?>>><<<I flew ool to Singapore on scoot, their cheap seats killed my back and their cheap food made me sick… great flight 🥴>>><<<For as low as under €199 it&#39;s a great deal.>>><<<One hour  and that is pushing it>>><<<Singapore Airlines is the best airline in the world but their Scoot low cost airline is a DISGRACE!>>><<<I flew Scoot from Athens to Bali via Singapore in April 2022 for just €340 both ways and couldn’t care less about the lack of the features you get from other long haul airlines. It was just perfect. Love Scoot!>>><<<Pay not much ger nothing.>>><<<12+ hours lowcost is definitely a challenge>>><<<Can you fly on royal air maroc 787-9 long haul ? It would be a great review!>>><<<Pay to use power source? OMG. Getoutathere>>><<<Triple challenge to review <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23myairline">#myairline</a>>>><<<About water, in Venice for example 0,75 l of water cost 6 or 7 euros😅>>><<<The quiet seats sound like an amazing idea. Get the power outlet, bring some extra food… and this would be a very tolerable flight.>>><<<The best pre-purchased meals are to be found on Pegasus Airlines (Do&amp;Co). Incredibly reasonable prices as well.>>><<<Flew them in June of last year when I needed a o/w flight to SIN on short notice (paid through the nose for that). <br>I thought I had done everything right but ended up not receiving the food I had ordered. You won&#39;t even get a cup of water for free (fill up an empty bottle in the washroom (Germany&#39;s tap water is great).<br>Scoot really is the world&#39;s worst airline. The staff cannot fix any issues (&quot;if we give you a meal,it will be deducted from our salary.&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t have to give you water, we&#39;re registered in Singapore.&quot;)<br>The crew doesn&#39;t know the website either. They&#39;re just hired guns with no strong ties to the customer experience.>>><<<tbh I don&#39;t see too much of a problem in the lack of in-flight entertainment, but the lack of wi-fi is bad. and water... just water. howdys from a person with kidney issues.>>><<<I have flown on PIA from Canada to Pakistan, and it is not a cheap flight, however, the product resembles Scoot&#39;s long haul a lot.>>><<<Airasia X KUL to Tehran (already discountiuned in 2018) <br>it was a 8 hrs flight but I enjoyed it <br>On the return to KL i was able to sleep on the whole middle row myself <br>To be honest Air asia&#39;s paid catering are much better than many other ordinary airlines>>><<<Just take a good book with you and download a few Netflix films on your iPad. It wont be that bad. Regarding the food, never once in my life have I had a meal on an airline which I would call “good”, low-cost or not.<br>Though to be honest, the seats look terrible, like on a bus.>>><<<Not on your life, great vids 😀👍🇦🇺>>><<<Watched this video 28FEB23. Checked Google Flights for economy tickets on the same route from 10MAR23 returning 20MAR23. Scoot costs €1,100 bare bones, if you fly via ZRH with Swiss an economy ticket (with meals, drinks, blankets, IFE, checked luggage) costs €949. WHY would anyone want to fly with Scoot? <br>BTW: “commitment to a good deal” is the nicest way to describe this BDSM experiment 😏>>><<<12 hours but it has to be a night flight and reach the destination by morning, so i can sleep 3/4 of the flight. the rest of the entertainment would be an iPad and Steamdeck. If i fly scoot for 6 hours and less i usually book the normal isle or window seat and for 6 hours + i book their scoot + because i want to sleep more comfortably.>>><<<I&#39;m impressed with your commitment! Can&#39;t imagine any prima donna reviewers following suit!>>><<<I am 6&#39;4&quot; (193cm) and there&#39;s no way I would take a flight like this one.>>><<<This looks like a nightmare after my flights with Singapore Airlines in business class 2 months ago !>>><<<You are correct you get what you pay for, Scoot and Air Asia are both superb low cost carriers.<br>Asias version of Ryanair.<br>Making travelling more fun for less🎉>>><<<We did Narita to Bangkok on Scoot’s 787….6+ hours.  We, thankfully, upgraded to SccotBiz and got a little more room and a free (bad) meal, but at least the seat was okay.<br><br>We go to Singapore frequently, so we’ve taken Scoot quite a few times.  If the flight is on a 787 and is less than 3 hours, I can handle it.  They at least have decent seat pitch.  If it’s on their A320, which has a whopping 28” seat pitch, I can handle a little over an hour (Singapore to Penang).  Other than that, we look for mainline airlines.  On an upcoming trip, we chose to use Thai round trip from Sing to Bangkok.  If you take account of baggage fees that you have to pay on Scoot, the Thai price was only about $25 more, well worth it.>>><<<Scoot is my favourite low cost airline. In 2019, I scooted from SIN to ATH and enjoyed the flight. As I was on a code share SQ ticket, meals, drinks and a souvenir blanket were included. Yes, I was allowed to take the blanket with me. The flight was overnight and the legroom wasn&#39;t quite enough (I&#39;m 196 cm tall), but otherwise it was a pleasant trip that I&#39;d happily take again.>>><<<Scoot (and other low cost carriers in Asia) forbids passengers from bringing their own food on board. How else would they be able to sell 330ml bottles of water at SGD3 and tiny portions of unappetizing food at SGD15 if they did?>>><<<nice 1<br>the longest i take was 8 hours>>><<<Isn’t Scoot the airline where you are forbidden from bringing your own food onboard?>>><<<Charging for water on a long haul fly should  be illegal!! <br>I didn&#39;t know and i was totally dehydrated from Perth to Singapore on my way to Athens..<br>just as well was the shorter leg of the trip.>>><<<Low cost carrier for me uhm probably 6-9 hours as I flew airasia from klia to gold coast however it was cramped>>><<<Each time I was considering taking Scoot for the Berlin-Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route, pricewise, it just wasn&#39;t worth it. If I include 1x checked luggage, 2x food, 2L of water and power outlet (all of which are necessary to me), the price turned out the same as with better airlines (Qatar or Emirates). So to me, it never made sense to choose Scoot on this route. Also, a big downside is the missing inflight entertainment. At least make it available as an add-on.>>><<<Providing water on long-haul flights for an affordable price should be mandatory. One of these days someone will pass out due to dehydration, will the mess be worth it? Giving people a liter of water with some crackers will cost them 1 euro.<br>But saving money on IFE is a good idea, it&#39;s definitely not mandatory for people who have their own devices.>>><<<I was fly on Shaheen Air (Semi Low-Cost Carrier of Pakistan Now defunct airline) in 2014 SKT-JED-SKT on A330 &amp; A320 without IFE but they provide free food and water. I also fly on Fly Dubai on SKT-DXB-TIF Route without food and IFE in 2017. So 10 hours in Shaheen Air and almost 6 Hours (excluding transit time at DXB) spent on Fly Dubai.>>><<<Where is the in flight entertainment and you have to pay for the food and drinks 🍸 🤔>>><<<Scoot sux. U are very brave>>><<<I fly scoot from Singapore to bali  ..4 hrs it was pathetic>>><<<MAYBE i will try to fly with Scootbut really not on such a long flight. Do they want extra money for using their toilets too?<br>And won`t EVER fly from this airport catastrophy , the first &quot;Berlin&quot;-Airport , that is not in Berlin , that no one ever needed , that costed much much more than it should have cost...>>><<<Beatiful video. Can you fly with Nordica new A320?>>><<<I won&#39;t fly a LCC for more than 5hrs>>><<<Scoot also fly their 787’s to Perth 😉>>><<<Tried out VietJetAir for 3 hours from Saigon to Chengdu and back, it was miserable. VJ is launching its Australia MEL SYD route so I would imagine a zero-entertainment A330 would be terrible for everyone>>><<<I’s be fine with a long route like that if it’s just me. I could fly a budget airline like Scoot for as long as I need to. 12, 13 hours? No problem. It’s only if I fly with family or friends that I would feel guilty and pay the extra amount to travel on a legacy for a more comfortable trip for them.>>><<<322 euros for such a service is not a normal price>>><<<I would swallow my sleeping pill just after take off. Wake me up just before landing!>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=120">2:00</a> not every Aussie is Richies okay?

I traveled in the same route in same airline in 2018. But I had no choice otherwise I had to select Terrible Saudi Airline>>><<<Maximum 3 hrs!>>><<<I could not fly on Scoot for that many hours unless I was in one of the comfy reclining seats and had brought food and plenty of water.  At least they don&#39;t charge you to use the toilets - yet.>>><<<This airline is a joke! But I flew with them in 2019 from Honolulu to Osaka for 140 USD + 15 USD for a seat in the &#39;quite zone&#39; which really wasn&#39;t a quite zone because somehow families with small children ended up here. They didn&#39;t allow passengers to eat of drink their own sandwiches and drinks and even cabin announcements were made that according to Singapore law it wasn&#39;t allowed to consume your own food or drinks. In the end nobody on board cared.  What do they want to do on a flight from the USA to Japan?>>><<<At early days, air asia KUL to LON standsed or Gatwick, i dont even remember, 16 hours>>><<<Did the same last summer, legroom was to small for a 190cm chubby human but you get what you pay. Cost me only 700€ Roundtrip (including extra luggage for 70€)>>><<<The dreamliner Is not so bad, besides I got my google play selection as well as a neck holder for my device and a Zendure supertanker....<br><br>But the seat pitch would put me off after flying SQ &amp; NZ In november.>>><<<This is the worst airline ever in the history of aviation <br>I travelled from Singapore to Korea and it was the longest flight of my life due to their poor services and poor condition of aircraft>>><<<Thank you soo much as always for the best reviews ever !!! But absolutely no way I would fly 12hrs on this thing, even if it was for free 😮>>><<<Why you have to punish yourself of taking this low cost flight for duration of 12 hours if Turkish Airlines one of the best airlines in Europe offers less than 700 Euros return from FRA to SIN with a full services ?>>><<<3 hours max>>><<<❤the new intro!>>><<<Oliverghan fuotballer>>><<<Uommenchandi Berlin>>><<<I would not do it if you were to pay me double the fare!>>><<<Scoot is getting from bad to worse!>>><<<Airasia’s inflight meal make even a full service airlines mean a shame 😅, like how SQ’s regional economy class meal served, it’s like snacks<br>Oh my , here I’m flying SQ from ZRH to DPS still complaining about how a downfall their service is , I think I won’t survived in this flight <br>But if they could sell BER - SIN return with 20 kg baggage 450€, I might give it a try <br>My longest <br>Lcc flight was Kul - kix with airasia it was ok for me>>><<<try jetstar airways, their b787 and the service was wayyy better.. and water is free>>><<<Doesn’t the livery look like ice cream?>>><<<There was a point when Norwegian flew between London and Singapore>>><<<Scoot still services the Gold Coast (OOL) in Australia, but only until July 17 this year. So technically, it still has a third destination, but for a short time only.>>><<<I completely enjoy your videos! Your diction added with your honesty is an absolute music to ears! U speak what is meant! Scoot charging to charge a phone is such a robbery😂! I wud never fly this airline on a long haul. Thank you for your honest reviews it always helps in choosing what one wants! Simple! 🙏🏻🙏🏻😊😊>>><<<4-5 hrs would be the maximum I&#39;d be able to bear>>><<<if its an under 5 hours flight, I might give it a go, but for longhaul flight, no way.... so now they allowed passengers to bring their own food/drinks?  before the pandemic it was forbidden, cmiiw>>><<<What a horrible flight...>>><<<Whoever made this video - thank you! You’re so detailed especially with the audio narration. Wish the videos were more like this 🙌🏼>>><<<Was on one of them to Perth yesterday mate>>><<<I would never fly low cost long haul 😂>>><<<It’s quite empathetic to make euros look like something valuable to waste on>>><<<a Lion Air is a economy class basic>>><<<Very interesting Video. As you said, you get what you paid for. Lot of Passangers are booking Flights without any Information about an Airline and its Service. Then they re surprised and complaining. So it might be helfpful to collect Informations about an Airline before you book.>>><<<Really interesting video. How low can they go with standards>>><<<Nah I hate Scoot even fot short haul. My go to is Airasia or Citilink>>><<<No, I will not fly Scoot on such long flight. I flew from Singapore to Sydney on an overnight flight. The seat was very uncomfortable an I had sore back and neck on arrival>>><<<I bring a waterjug thats around 2 of those water bottles.>>><<<Not in a million years. Avoid them like the plague. I&#39;d rather pay more for a reasonable flight.>>><<<Who pays for the power? Just use your powerbank...>>><<<There is even Ryanair better>>><<<Agree about AirAsia food is better>>><<<had a flight from berlin to bkk with scoot in 2022 and it was only 280€ roundtrip, want to have these prices back haha>>><<<Ideally never but if push comes to shove 3 hours max>>><<<I wouldn&#39;t agree about the charging ports. They&#39;re almost never existant on ULCCs so this is a bonus to have. Plus if your business model  is based on absolute minimal costs, someones gotta pay for the installation, maintenance and extra fuel burn from having them. Just dont use them if you dont have to.>>><<<Their 787-800s also flies to Perth Every day !>>><<<Hi simply aviaton can you try new company Airlines in malaysia? MyAirline>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=499">8:19</a> you have to you pay to use the power outlet never flying this airline>>><<<I flew Scoot from ICN-TPE around 7 years ago. It took about 2 and a half hours. Suffice it to say, that was long enough.>>><<<Thanks for this report, perfect as usual 🙂>>><<<I would fly Scoot. Just for the ”silence” sector. 👍>>><<<Scoot is ok for short haul but not really long haul>>><<<No more than 4 hours and yes, I would have tablet loaded with Movies and Tv&#39;s shows and food and drink!>>><<<Maybe I would fly with full-service airline so I can charge my electronic device and entertain myself. Flying the low-cost airline is okay but only for 3 hours maximum>>><<<Last year I did a 8 hour budget airline flight on Norse from Berlin to Newark and honestly, it was fine. The movies were free, the plane was brand new, the legroom was fine (certainly no worse than a regular airline). The only thing I had to pay for was a meal, which was $20 (and honestly kinda tasty), but considering the ticket was $289 (!) it was well worth it.>>><<<Optimally 90m, maybe 5h-6h transcon/trans-canada at most>>><<<I&#39;d probably say above 4 hours starts to become a bad experience for me. I flew ryanair for that long with my knees pressed against the seat in front. Really uncomfortable by the end of it. Awesome video btw!>>><<<I genuinely think I would be able to handle this lol<br><br>Before the pandemic, every other Christmas break, my parents would take me to China, since that&#39;s where they grew up, and my last visit had been when I was 12 years old. Every single flight I took, I would literally just starve myself for 12 hours straight, since I was and still am a pretty picky eater, and airplane food really just doesn&#39;t appeal to me in general. Air China&#39;s entertainment system wasn&#39;t all that interesting to me either, as it didn&#39;t have games, and all the movies were for grown-ups, and I had no headphones. They did provide pillows, except I ALSO have problems with those too, it&#39;s that I literally cannot sleep on a warm pillow, and it&#39;s why at home, I use a sofa cushion as my pillow since it stays cool for longer. I still tried to sleep though, I would usually just lie down on my mom&#39;s lap the next seat over, and close my eyes, except I was never actually able to fall asleep doing that>>><<<Having flown Scoot 1 year ago, I swore never never never ever again . Even allowing for «  you get what you pay for in life » they are a disgrace, abusive, shameful airline. Stay away from them . !!!>>><<<Flying Scoot for long haul is more of a punishment unless you know you have some to expect at your destination. But then you have to fly back on that same cattle car aircraft to get back home. Whatever relaxation to be had is gone out the door. But I can understand if others are willing to put up with it. But lack of water on the flight for free? That&#39;s pretty low. I hope they don&#39;t act like this with their maintenance of their aircraft.>>><<<I sat on a short KUL-SIN flight on scoot in an Exit row and it felt never ending, mind you I would love to try this.>>><<<More airlines should do what Scoot does on their long-haul aircraft. Having a silent cabin is great because one time on a flight there were babies crying so much all the time>>><<<I’ve flown scoot from Sydney to Singapore 3 times and on to Bangkok once, the service is fine as long as you don’t expect much, I flew once in what they, at the time, called business class and that was a fail. Priority boarding, not done, priority disembarkation, not done, free wifi, broken but it was $3AUD more so I wasn’t complaining.>>><<<No power unless you pay? My massive Anker power bank finally gets to see some action>>><<<“Would you fly scoot-“ HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Terrible experience, I flew the exact same plane (9V-OFI) when it was 2 months old and the cabin was already in terrible condition.>>><<<Absolutely now way I would pay for electric outlet. Long haul without in flight entertainment is a no from me. Just checked and it would be cheaper to take Quatar from Edinburgh to Singapore with layover in Doha than Scoot with layover in Berlin. Ridiculous. Charging for water on a long haul should also be illegal.>>><<<Flappy bird , dude that game has been removed, if scoot offers flappy bird its good enough>>><<<I flew from Gold Coast to Singapore with Scoot one time and I love the amount of leg space there is in the scoot silence and peacefulness, but flying 7 hours on a red eye flight without entertainment can be dead boring. Next time I’ll download movies to my device.>>><<<It was the cheap passengers that wanted the lowest fare for creation of no thrill airlines. Of course you have to pay for expensive foods if you paid cheap tickets. We have plenty of cattle class airlines in the U.S.: Spirit; Frontier; Southwest. I don&#39;t feel sorry for poor people suffering.>>><<<I flown once on scoot 787 from Singapore to KL and never again. The plane was is such a bad state, worse plane I ever been on. The arm rest was attached to the seat by silver tape, the wall panels were held in place also by silver tape. The seat in front of me was broken and when someone sat in it, it tilted completely to the left. The wings on the plane were 6 shades of gray. Never again, only time I ever felt scared on a plane. I am a frequent travel>>><<<I wish Berlin would see full-service carriers like Singapore Airlines, Emirates, and Etihad Airways. BER should get many more full-service long-haul flights, apart from Qatar Airways and United Airlines services.>>><<<10 hours at max>>><<<Most low cost isn&#39;t long haul so you&#39;d rarely get the opportunity to endure it for 13 hours!I think that Scoot do a slightly more upmarket seat which is called Scoot Buisness but it&#39;s more like Premium Economy.>>><<<&quot;The price is right&quot; means that the total cost inclusive of adequate food, water, power outlet, luggage, entertainment is lower than the alternative. I would certainly fly Scoot if the price is right.>>><<<Honestly they seem very reasonable and they do have some impressive fares between Australia and Asia. but thats just me. The only thing I am concerned about is water, I think thats a bit too extreme. Everything else seems tolerable, I can bring my own food to my desired liking, the seats dont look cramped, and the lack of blankets I can dress accordingly or bring my own. Entertainment, I can pack a book and reduce my dependency on a power socket. But bringing water is a hassle since youll need to find someplace to fill it up after security and ensure you have enough for such a flight. Water is inexpensive to provide to pax.>>><<<Having no IFE is not such a big deal.  Back in the day IFE on a B747 meant a movie projected onto a bulkhead screen.  So only some passengers got a good viewing angle.  And the audio was piped through tubes to headphones &amp; quality of the audio was atrocious.  And you could listen to radio shows etc through a menu system.  So, most people brought books to read.>>><<<Excellent review David!😸>>><<<I flew Athens - Singapore and had a 13 hour layover in a pay for use lounge. I then flew to Sydney. It was cheap and cheerful and no issues.>>><<<I spent 3 hours on Scoot last year.  NEVER AGAIN.>>><<<Did Boston to Paris via Iceland on Play airlines.  5.5 hours plus another 3.  Longest narrow body I’ve flown on overseas since I was 4 and flew Lufthansa 707 to Germany ( back when flying was civilized).  I’d say it was so good, I’d fly another 10 hours with them.  Great legroom and awesome crew and prices on board were very good.>>><<<My longest flight on a lowcost airline was jinair from clark to seoul and it wasnt all bad. There was <b>purchasable</b> food onboard but no plug or entertainment, but i slept through the entire 4 hr flight since it was 2 am 😅>>><<<my flight was ok, SIN-ATH.>>><<<If Ryanair would offer longhaul flights, I think this is what it would look like. I don’t think I would fly on an airline like this for more than 4, or maybe 5 hours.>>><<<Flew London to Bangkok last September. Cheapest flight was on Scoot and it was direct, but I decided to pay £40 more to fly with Gulf Air , with a transfer via Bahrain. It was a great choice. Cheap no frills airlines are great for short haul, but intolerable for 10+ hour flights.>>><<<I loved that thunderstorm while landing>>><<<My longest low-cost flight so far was 5 hours BUD-DXB onboard a Wizzair A321NEO, but at your flight at least you got the thunderstorm for free upon landing XDDDDD>>><<<My longest flight that I have ever been on was 10hr long and it felt like I was sitting in the flight for ever>>><<<I honestly strongly disagree on classifying Scoot as &quot;low cost&quot; or even &quot;ultra low cost&quot;. Same exact thing with &quot;nearby&quot; Jetstar.<br>The biggest supporting fact to this is that those two &quot;low cost long haul carriers&quot; are still in business while Norwegian has gone backrupt.<br>Those two airlines (Scoot &amp; Jetstar) which are always mentioned as example of &quot;low cost long haul thanks to the 787&quot; appear to be low cost because the main comparison is to their parent companies. They&#39;re the Eurowings of Asia-Oceania pretty much: they&#39;re not &quot;low cost&quot; they&#39;re &quot;lower cost&quot; compared to very high prices of their mainline high standard full service parent airlines (Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa).>>><<<Tbh, depends on the plane. If it was a 747-200 or this kind of stuff I could fly it forever. A 737? 5 hours max.>>><<<Doesn&#39;t scoot ban from taking outside food?<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBPc_MwfHyw">https://youtu.be/jBPc_MwfHyw</a>>>><<<Longest flight with a low cost carrier: Sun Country Airlines from MSP to PUJ; 4.5 hrs>>><<<Did Singapore to Melbourne on scoot, 7 hours and that’s the maximum time I would be on an LCC>>><<<Bruh, literally I can&#39;t be more thankful to you for putting the glimpse of my home city Karachi @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=559">9:19</a> and I bet you have eagle eyes, you even noticed the airport from high above. Can&#39;t wait to see you at Karachi, do try the new airlines of Pakistan. Lots of love and keep making these superb trip reports and brutally honest reviews!>>><<<FlyScoot is better than AirAsia……<br>BUT AirAsia win for the meal price….3 times cheaper…..>>><<<I took this flight from Singapore to Berlin (return) in 2019 and paid SGD 545 (or 380€) base fare and I agree with your whole assessment with the exception of in-seat power. Power supply is not a basic necessity and most people bring their power banks so Scoot charging for it seems like fair game as a low-cost carrier. I especially agree with your assessment on the price of water and quality of food. I don&#39;t understand why they can&#39;t emulate AirAsia&#39;s quality. Also, I paid extra for Scoot-in-silence and I can&#39;t recommend it enough. Seats had more legroom but more importantly, you were guaranteed no screaming infant in that section of the cabin or unruly child kicking the back of your seat. Certainly helps with anxiety! In that regard, Scoot may be a better option compared to other airlines (especially SQ where their amenities, quality and portion of food in economy class have been declining since the resumption of travel but their prices have increased substantially). Anyway, thank you for providing a fairly balanced review of Scoot&#39;s long-haul!>>><<<Depends...can you bring food onboard?>>><<<Not only is BER to MEL 13 h + 7 h, it is also a 20h layover in Singapore!!>>><<<Well I guess unless there is a €200 difference, I&#39;m not flying them. If you can&#39;t sleep during this flight it&#39;s going to be a long 13h>>><<<I’ve been to Berlin and Athens with this Airline……>>><<<I think I would go for max 3 - 4 hours, maybe 5, but thats really maybe, would have to be such a huge price difference or other flight would be with long layover and etc, 12 hours in low cost, never. Otherwise nice video, I like this series.>>><<<I don’t think the buy on board prices were bad at all. A 500ml bottle of water is 6€ in Frankfurt. Airport pricing will not save you any money.>>><<<Hey a cabin were baby’s are not allowed in, I’d take that>>><<<i’m greek/australian living in greece but planning to move to australia. i want to go there beforehand and i’ve been trying to find cheap tickets. i was planning on flying with scoot, because of the cheap price, and as im not the most wealthy person, i thought that it was a great deal (before seeing reviews), as singapore stopped flights from athens to there, so scoot is one of the only airlines that connects greece to southeast asia directly (air china costs 1.560e per person…) but honestly i think i’ll just go with emirates. i don’t think i can survive in that cabin with no amenities and no free food, water and entertainment. would rather pay more>>><<<I flew from Seattle to Frankfurt on Condor! Not anymore!!! Never again! The legroom is horrible, food as well. They do have entertainment screens but they offer only 2 free movies and if you need more, you have to pay 10€ for nothing, literally!!! The worst experience,!!!>>><<<Thanks David for introduce Karachi Pakistan where my residence is>>><<<Max 5 hours>>><<<never ever, no, nein, nie, thats to much, scoot from BER to SIN da wüsste ich ein ei am wandern haben. und dafür haben sie aber auch noch einen für das gebotene viel viel zu hohen preis, oder die restlichen carrier sind zu billig.>>><<<sounds good flight to me......serves a population that wants to fly>>><<<purchase your own food before you board.........and bring a warm coat/etc to sleep in.......>>><<<Such a shame about the mediore food. You&#39;d expect better from a Singaporean carrier of all things, even a budget one, especially as Air Asia really do a fantastic job. I&#39;ve flown on Air Asia and Air Asia X, and their meals have always been fantastic value, and something I actively look forward to when flying with them.>>><<<how about 0.  Ya i would spend 0>>><<<Wow that was a cheap cheap flight>>><<<Hi, pls try FitsAir of srilankas low cost airline>>><<<I fly business class 90% of the time(if available) but this one time I took scoot from Philippines to Singapore and boy did I feel miserable 😅 I’m also 191cm and 250lbs. I paid to board 1st but was the last to board 😮>>><<<Isn&#39;t it forbidden to bring your own food and water aboard Scoot?<br>Even if you have to buy expensive bottled water after passing airport&#39;s security.<br>But I think it is still cheaper than onboard Scoot.<br>Anyway, I am 63 and I would never ever squeeze me in such a seat for 13 hrs.<br>Thrombosis assured.>>><<<Me and my brother took the exact same flight. The cost was the only good thing about this flight. But you have to pay 11 $ for the most shitty food you will ever get on an airplane. Even Lufthansa serves better food.<br><br>Thanks for making this Video>>><<<I love your brutally honest videos>>><<<Yes  scoot😊>>><<<Cuando estás acostumbrado a hacer ayuno el problema de la comida no es el inconveniente, lo del agua si es un robo, y el entretenimiento abordo, bueno es una aerolínea de bajo costo y no puedes esperar mucho, no viajaría con ellos independientemente de que fuera un precio atractivo, la comida prepagada está mejor en todos los aspectos en las aerolíneas turcas de bajo costo.>>><<<I&#39;d never do it, but I watched the video anyway.  😊>>><<<Maybe short haul flights but not long hauls! I do not appreciate the cost of water and power outlets!<br>Thank you sir for the option to share us your report!>>><<<I probably will have some PTSD after that 13 hours flight>>><<<This is what flying long haul with Ryanair, Easyjet, Wizz, or Spirit would look like. Shudders.>>><<<I don&#39;t think the power is free at all.  My guess is they aren&#39;t running that on batteries, but on jet fuel that&#39;s converted to electricity.  In that case it&#39;s expensive electricity.>>><<<Im an alcoholic so I dont care ill take the cheapest flight then get wasted and fall asleep>>><<<What a shameee!!! These airlines should bankrupt! I hate low cost carriers, they changes the way of flying…>>><<<The only way I would fly a discount airline that kind of distance is in their premium cabin, otherwise I&#39;ll pay the extra couple of hundred bucks for more comfort, an entertainment system, free meals and all the water I want.>>><<<That’s the saddest economy class I’ve ever seen>>><<<Hut ab.. und ich reg mich schon auf, weil ich naechste Woche mit Norwegian von Stockholm nach Helsinki fliegen muss....>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=647">10:47</a><br>That isn’t entirely true. The power outlets themselves cost money to install and maintain. <br><br>But the price they are charging is very high.>>><<<Great review of Scoot, David! I fly with Scoot quite often as they are based in Singapore and you really pay for what you get. The cabin crew are quite good imo.>>><<<Tomorrow I&#39;ll give Scoot a try, flying ScootPlus from Hangzhou to KL for around 410 AUD one way.>>><<<My family tried to check the price to book scoot and jetstar last year when we went to sg from manila ph. It was very high compared to singapore airlines. So we just booked Singapore airlines instead.>>><<<Not more than 3 hours :D>>><<<Maximum time is about 10 hours on Thomas Cook Scandinavia from Cancun to Copenhagen, it was awful, was either really hot or really cold the food was the best part but they didn&#39;t come round offering drinks. I was second to last row so I could grab some snacks and water though. The orange juice for the breakfast was still frozen solid.>>><<<I see, you could only afford Scoot because you maxed out the budget on that sick intro.>>><<<Great flight. Imagine you didn&#39;t pre-ordered meal, you&#39;ll be training for fasting on board.>>><<<My maximum would be 4 hours>>><<<With easyjet Ryan air and Co not longer than 3 hours. Longhaul only in a premium cabin probably as the legroom in economy is already tight with full fare carriers. I can bring my own food or purchase it plus I have my tablet anway.>>><<<I did the SIN-MEL flight in the middle seat. It wasn&#39;t THAT bad but god damn you are crazy for doing 13 hours on Scoot.>>><<<Bring an empty one litre bottle through security and fill it up before boarding. For $10 you can buy more than enough bread, cheese, meat, granola bars and snacks for the flight. 50ml bottles of vodka cost about $1 at a liquor store and are legal to carry on board.>>><<<Scoot apparently doesn’t allow you to eat your own food onboard, which is mind blowing to me.>>><<<I&#39;d fly scoot just for the experience of flying a new airline>>><<<I said to myself all along that &quot;Yeah, would pay for it.&quot;<br>But asking money to use power outlet....Literally the energy is generated by the engines...If noone pays for it, they wont just turn it off... Would never fly with them because of this.>>><<<Scoot delivers what it says it will deliver except that its prepaid meals are not very good. The cabin crew is also aloof.  Air Asia gives a similar deal but with delicious meals and friendly cabin crew. They also offer their Premium Flatbed seats which are similar to business class comfort.  I look forward to more long haul flights being introduced by Air Asia.>>><<<Talking about water, look at how much Qatar charges you at Doha during transit. Paying for water on a transit hub is stupidity considering how high they price their tickets. To add to that, the security makes you dispose your pre-bought water bottles at entry.>>><<<After reading Scoot airline web site and the part about food and drink, i think travellers will be in for a huge surprise, in that it says consumption of food and drink from outside of the flight is not allowed to be eaten or drunk on board, i love to know how the flight crew would in force this rule as i could see many people on board having their own stuff. Strange this wasn&#39;t mentioned in this review.>>><<<Unfortunately, I’m flying with them in April from SIN to ATH so thank u so much for showing so I can be prepared… especially for the water ! 😆>>><<<If the price is good and flight available in our country I will fly with sccot>>><<<322 EU for a one way ticket ain&#39;t really &quot;cheap&quot; either...>>><<<Ah... SFI...>>><<<I want Felix. He doesn’t talk.>>><<<Budget airlines are..budget airlines, basically an air taxi point A to B. Everything other than your body, shoes an the clothes you&#39;re wearing comes with an extra fee 😄<br>......bon voyage 👋>>><<<I Stay Max 6 Houers In Basic Economy Class.Great Work>>><<<Love this series!>>><<<I was surprised by SAS with their free tea/coffee, but expensive water like Scoot.  After a 4.5hr at the start of the journey (with no vouchers), I would have expected to get a cup of water on board.>>><<<13 Hours ???  I wouldn&#39;t set foot in a 787 NightMare Liner (aka ScreamLiner) for 13 seconds.  Give me an a350 anyday.>>><<<I went to Australia and back for less than €600 with this airline on this route - if all you want is to get from point a to point b then its perfect. It is simply a long haul Ryanair. Thank you scoot for making worldwide travel available for everyone. (Also the same route with other carriers was at least double the price - so not worth it for just some unnecessary luxury extras)>>><<<Their is no way I could take a flight like this. 7euros for power? Wow, I&#39;ll pass.>>><<<respect. would be ok with it if i could bring my own food>>><<<I remember flying Etihad from Belgrade to Singapore in 2018 for 350 euros. Good old times.>>><<<Great review David! If it were short haul, Scoot would be a good choice if prices are low, but Long Haul, probably not.>>><<<6 hours edit: Scoot silence is GENIUS and every airline needs it +1 point for scoot>>><<<5 hours top!>>><<<Flying with Scoot in May, glad to hear they have Wifi as I will have work to do!>>><<<I&#39;m flying to Singapore in a little over a week, but to XSP and not SIN 🙃>>><<<Low cost over 2h is a big no!>>><<<Wait, I thought Scoot prohibits bringing your own food and water on board?>>><<<Great video.<br><br>My flight from Berlin to Athens on Scoot (during covid) for 50€ was enough for me to figure out i rather fly other airlines on long haul flights.<br>Sometimes if you look up the prices the base ticket without food, luggage or entertainment is just a bit cheaper than other carriers. Not worth it in my opinion.>>><<<If I could get one of the recliner seats for less than economy on a full-service airline, I would definitely fly with them. If that wasn&#39;t an option, it would have to be cheap enough that I could still buy things like meals and an aisle seat for significantly less money (hundreds of dollars less) than others.>>><<<Yep, if the price is right, I think it&#39;s worth considering Scoot. Otherwise...nah.>>><<<No tv on bord ? It&#39;s low cost but 12 h they Can add TV>>><<<Nah, I will definitely choose AirAsia over Scoot 🥲>>><<<Love the sound of  an airline banning baby&#39;s from sections of aircrafts I would pay the premium for not sitting near a baby>>><<<As Carol Burnett once said to a Passenger. Excuse me Sir are you flying in the not frills Section ?.  Well yes. <br>OK then get your foot of the rug. <br>😂>>><<<I would not spend a minute on a low cost carrier, I only chose traditional airlines.>>><<<I mean sure, flights from europe to singapore are really expensive, so yeah I would still probably fly with them>>><<<Woah…… 13 hours is insane. I flew them for 8 hours and was already regretting it…… good job though!>>><<<Great review 😀 I have flown this exact route myself back in 2018 from the old Tegel Airport. And just as you say you get what you pay for and in my opinion Scoot makes this very clear in the booking process. As for the power outlets, just use a power bank 😀 If you are traveling with checked in bags it may actually be worth comparing flights with other non LCC airlines as it may actually cost more or less the same>>><<<What next, charge extra for using the restroom?>>><<<OK but like I wanted to go to Singapore so badly that I would actually take a cheap flight to Berlin and then do this. I don’t live in the United States so low cost is very easy to get to Berlin.>>><<<flew SQ325 FRA-SIN on 23/02/23. Water was served from pitchers, not bottles. When dinner was served, I asked for a Beer and was told that they have run out of bier. SGD$600Mil+ profit in the last quarter and all the cost cutting = no bier. Now we know why we are no longer #1. May as well just Scoot.>>><<<The silence seat is worth every penny.>>><<<Bro did for us🥺>>><<<never put your feet on any long haul budget airline, it will make you feel miserable.>>><<<I took Scoot on a fifth-freedom flight from Berlin to Athens one year ago, which obviously wasn&#39;t such a bad experience compared to the other options you have on this route. But I seriously can&#39;t imagine to be onboard their Boeing 787 for 13 hours! So thanks that you sacrificed yourself for me...😂🙌>>><<<Indigo offers much better meals. I rather have their sandwiches than Scoots meal.>>><<<Back in February 2020 (just before Covid hit) my parents and I were on vacation in Indonesia. We were checking flight offers from Berlin (still TXL back then) to Denpasar and were actually considering Scoot for a moment. I watched a trip report on their 787 too, I think it might&#39;ve even been on this channel. We decided against it eventually, especially because my mom wouldn&#39;t agree to spending 12+ hours without entertainment. When we finally went to Indonesia again over Christmas 2022, almost 3 years later, we still decided for full service airlines instead. It&#39;s worth the extra money to us xD<br><br>The longest low cost flight I had so far was on EasyJet from Berlin BER to Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt, around 4 hours of flight time time (+ the return flight obviously). Yea, that was painful enough, I think the longest I&#39;d agree to would be 6 hours>>><<<Anything more than 3 hours on an LCC is a big NO for me.>>><<<I would go absolutely mad being on a flight that long with no in-flight entertainment.>>><<<Thanks David for this report.     I would have to be in a desperate situation to fly Scoot or any similar cheapie airline on long haul.     Short haul would be OK, but that&#39;s it for me.   I rather pay money and have a pleasant experience.>>><<<Seems better than US economy flights>>><<<Decend not approach>>><<<On December 2022, I have ever tried flying Scoot 787-8 9V-OFE from Osaka Kansai to Singapore Changi for 7 hours, and I even sat at the same seat as you: 33K! (sadly it&#39;s a different plane). But the flight did not feel good. I was so bored during the flight, and thirsty as well.>>><<<Im totally convinced that people that choose this airline knowingly, just hate themselves. I wouldn’t even get on a scoot longhaul flight even if you paid me.<br><br>So thanks for your sacrifice 😂>>><<<maximum 4 hours, especially not on scoot>>><<<You advised passengers to bring their own food and drink. Does Scoot allow that now? In other reviews I saw, it was said that Scoot had a strict policy of forbidding the carrying and consumption of any outside food and drink, with angry crew confiscating the product and, if they saw it before takeoff, even threatening to expel the passenger from the plane.>>><<<Never.>>><<<Very nice low price! 😀>>><<<Man... that kinda suck Can you make a Brutally Honest on Norse? Or Your Turkish Airlines Buisness Class on their A350-900 From Istanbul-Johanseberg.>>><<<You took one for the team!>>><<<I’d consider myself as a price conscious traveler but I think low cost on a long haul flight is something I’d not be willing to do.<br>Thanks for providing this excellent, honest review>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot before. To and fro Langkawi, Da Nang, Hanoi and Bangkok (on their 787), all pretty short hops. They were pretty bearable, it got us from point A to B without much fuss. However beware of delays like one I experienced on the return leg from Bangkok - I&#39;ve heard of some that can get as long as a day or even cancelled. Scoot is mainly infamous for its delays. I&#39;ve been lucky enough not to experience that long of a delay - only a couple hours wait. All in all, if you&#39;ve got enough entertainment and food, fly Scoot if there is no other option. However if there are other options such as Air Asia (anywhere within ASEAN, NOT AIR ASIA X) or Zipair (3 times a week flights to Narita), fly those instead. I seriously can&#39;t bear 10-13 hours on a Scoot flight, let alone it being delayed.>>><<<I’m sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk?>>><<<I’m sure scoot flies 787 to lgw from bkk?>>><<<I can&#39;t imagine flying on that... holy... <br>If I fly 14 hrs on emirates a380 and its still tiring af, imagine on a scoot 0_0>>><<<I used to fly scoot biz<br> from Melbourne to Singapore pre Covid. It was comfortable and a good price. Haven&#39;t flown them since>>><<<Scoot is probably the worst airline I’ve ever been in. Pathetic seats on the 787 that lack any lumbar support or headrest and the arrogant staff.>>><<<Scoot&#39;s website says that you are not allowed to bring your own food and drinks on board. I will give this poor excuse for an airline a wide berth. Take an alternative route>>><<<If the price is right, I would fly with Scoot. I would definitely consider upgrading to that Scoot-in-Silence cabin. Extra legroom seats, private cabin and like David mentioned, adjustable headrests. The one on the 787-8 is particularly good. I’m waiting for an opportunity to try it myself. The ground service is where the airline falls down on bad days, so that’s one thing to consider too.>>><<<imo good food keeps people happy. The very least that scoot can do is improve the catering, because just by looking at it, I lost all appetite lol>>><<<Someome said it<br><br>Airasia meal better scoot<br>Mean MY food fair better than SG 😂😂😂>>><<<air-Asia was first  based in Malaysia it explains the better food and its current hub is Indonesia which also has great food :&gt; nah just kidding Singapore airlines has pretty great food.>>><<<Amazing content David! Must have been exhilarating to be landing in a thunderstorm!!>>><<<nice bro>>><<<Maximum 4 hrs are my limit on Low Cost Airlines.>>><<<My longest flight with a low cost carrier was with Norwegian between Copenhagen and Los Angeles. As long as you know it is taking 11 hours, you brought your own food purchased at the airport, which is better than the one served or purchased on board, you have your iPad with movies and a book. A similar experience than with a regular airline in Economy especially after the pandemic where many perks are axed.>>><<<Nasi Lemak is from Malaysia not Singapore>>><<<LETS GO IM EARLY AGAIN>>><<<Super Video David! :-)>>><<<This is the sad and bad part of singapore airlines that they dont hope we see. Scoot is owned by parent company Singapore airlines. Singapore airlines (SIA) is such a good airline but its sad to see them do such money grabbing things like power plug charges and bottled water prices being so high (on SIA power and water is free) if SIA made power free and water way cheaper that would really make the WHOLE Singapore airlines corporation truly, a great way to fly. For now it seems that they are pouring everything they have into SIA which is not bad either but a little attention to the budget side of SIA will do it some good. I personally have never flown scoot (i cant handle without IFE soryyyyyy) I almost always fly Singapore but i wouldn&#39;t mind trying them on short hops to places like Malaysia in the future. Lastly thx for ur review :D<br><br>-love from Singapore :P>>><<<I have never seen any airline that CHARGES you to use a power outlet. That’s outrageous>>><<<I’m planning on living in Australia for university next year so as I’m from Europe, I guess I’ll need to book a Scoot flight 😭💀>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc">0:00</a> Let the 12h torture begin>>><<<I&#39;ve flown Scoot from Singapore to Gold Coast and that was a interesting experience.>>><<<Dude literally sacrificed 13 hours for the bros>>><<<Please review about Cambodia Angkor air !>>><<<5-6 hrs>>><<<Flying with them in April and doing Sydney to Singapore and I am looking forward to seeing what it’s like>>><<<Ah yes. Thanks for reviewing Scoot as I plan to fly with them on my trip to Australia. Those fees for water and power outlet are indeed… outrageous. I’d rather fly with Cebu Pacific if I have the luxury of time (which they don’t provide as they are notorious for being the least punctual airline in Manila).>>><<<I love you David! Simply Aviation>>><<<I’m actually so glad that you guys did a Brutally Honest episode on Scoot! As a not-so-rich Singaporean, I frequently fly on Scoot to visit my family in China since they were the only airline that operated direct flights to those cities in China. Which basically means I frequently fly 8.5 hours on their 787 and 5.5 hours on their A320 (which is very painful). It’s definitely not ideal, but its like the only thing I can afford.>>><<<Water bottles should be complimentary>>><<<How did you survive such a long flight without any form of in-flight entertainment haha. Great video as always!!>>><<<That’s what we call Taking one for the team. Sacrificing yourself for twelve hours in ultra low cost long haul so we the subscribers don’t have to! You have achieved boss status!>>><<<I flew scoot from Berlin to Athens last year. Good enough for the 3 hours, but I don’t think I would want to fly the entire way to Singapore with them>>><<<War der Flug nicht trotz des Inflight Wifis furchtbar langweilig???<br>Und wird das Philippine Airlines MNL - JFK Video ein Tripreport oder ein Brutally Honest Video sein? (Ich würde Tripreport favorisieren...) Wie immer, sehr gutes Video!>>><<<Scood is in polite...🤭 And  Mum&#39;s Fried Rice.. 🤣 🤣 🤣. My Mom doesn&#39;t cook fried rice but pasta.. 🤣>>><<<Damn....I would save more then, would NEVER fly an ultra long haul on Scoot!>>><<<I’ve flown Scoot from Sydney to Singapore in the fly in silence cabin . The food was pretty dire and on our flight we weren’t allowed to take one’s own food on board , however , having said that , for the price we paid it was good value and I’d do it again .>>><<<They charge for power outlets??>>><<<Actually i don´t really need IFE or Food for 12h. I can use my tablet computer to entertain myself and bring a few snacks with me to keep me from starving.<br>My major issue with Scoot is about the legroom. Being 190cm tall, there is no way to stay on this plane for longhaul.<br>What i really love is the silence area. Every airline should introduce an area, where no small children or drunk douchebags are allowed.>>><<<Mein Beileid.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1uzMVPBtc&amp;t=433">7:13</a> Actually, Scoot will ban you for bringing outside food and drink, which is a really disgusting rule.>>><<<I would go crazy, this gives me flashbacks to Air Canada Rouge>>><<<Nice trip report David! Looking forward for this ❤>>><<<Scoot is one of the best LCCs around. It could rival some full service airlines in some countries.>>><<<&quot;I loved Tegel airport&quot; said no Berlin resident ever>>><<<I have been in one of Scoot&#39;s business-class flights from Singapore to Hangzhou a couple of years ago. The service was good, but to my surprise, there was no USB port on the seat while the AC power outlet was offered. So I had to plug in my laptop and then charge my phone with it.>>><<<Is there the tripreport for this?>>><<<i ♥the Boeing 787>>><<<longest was on Air Asia around 9h.. i think.. KUL-Melbourne>>><<<nice>>><<<Nice video>>><<<no comments? ima fix that>>><<<Never Flyscoot! The most dodgiest airline I’ve flown with, they crushed our checked in belongings and never took responsibility for it, apparently a British company is looking after customers complaints and blaming customers for not having insurance as an excuse, absolute scammers, you pay less but end up paying more with their food scam and low quality services.>>><<<I flew them a lot years ago and after all the expats retired realised all their pilots are autoland kings and told by deadheading US cargo captain they were banned from flying OZ.<br>NOW they have merged with KE>>><<<I usually find Scoot very good for a LCC>>><<<Hard Rock hotel... ouch. Stay on the mainland next time, maybe Warehouse Hotel, Mandrin or Ritz. All have pools, all better. Capella best on Sentosa but tbh much more expensive, rather negates Scoot. Love the content>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrzWbgOomvw&amp;t=510">8:30</a> is when the video starts showing scoot airlines>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrzWbgOomvw&amp;t=104">01:44</a> - That&#39;s my favorite mass produced chocolate in Japan!

No way for me to travel.>>><<<Upset this wasn&#39;t called steaks on a plane>>><<<The advantage of the bottom-fill beer is not getting a huge head on it when you have people who don’t know how to serve one>>><<<I think that and Cebu Pacific although I think Cebu Pacific is mostly used for flights within the Philippines.>>><<<wait till u fly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23myairline">#Myairline</a>>>><<<ambulance story please>>><<<Jace is such a good trip companion>>><<<Never has a prob with Scoot, will use them every time I can>>><<<Japanese whisky  ?   how does that wotk  ?  There is only one Scotch , and that is Scotch whisky>>><<<I flew Scoot from Tokyo to S&#39;pore via Taipei. Very cheap in tourist class, very pleasant (despite strong crosswinds coming into Taipei) and great staff (couple of stunners, too). Hoping to try again.>>><<<Do NOT fly Scoot if you value yourself. This airline lost my trench coat, which was in the checked-in luggage, and refused to compensate for the loss. What is even worse is that Scoot keeps wasting your time by repeating the same BS again and again.>>><<<I flown with Scoot just so I can fly on a 787 for the first time. I find them quite the pleasant airline>>><<<Did fly SCOOT,, was ok>>><<<I’d love a video on how u became a photographer for f1 and how their system works . Are there licenses for a fixed amount - is their a wait list or apprentice system- is the pay fixed - do u work as a freelancer or for f1 or fia? What benefits are there ? How many are there? Do u own ur photos or does f1? Is travel and accomodation covered and per diems? Etc etc would love to learn about it>>><<<Hope ur son appreciates how lucky he is to have such a cool dad who takes him to work on such an amazing job<br><br>If he doesn’t I’m eligible for adoption- I’m 43 but still keen>>><<<The closest I&#39;ve come to Scoot is when I noticed by chance that the return flight of my over priced SQ flight was on Scoot. It didn&#39;t happen.>>><<<Why don’t you get a direct flight?>>><<<Honestly, I used to fly scoot plus often and it´s a really good deal, someitmes you find the price of the eco seat for the same as the scoot plus, it´s spaicous, nothing extraordinary but it´s cheap and you´ll get to your destination...>>><<<I’m slightly surprised that there isn’t a direct flight between Perth and Osaka. It sounds like and obvious route for someone to take, perhaps Perth and it’s surroundings isn’t as big a place as I picture them to be.>>><<<Hi Kym, how do you keep all your memberships organized?>>><<<I had really good experiences with flying round trip Vanilla Air from Taiwan to Japan! Highly recommend them.  Also if you&#39;re in Japan the JR pass is amazing, its a flat rate fee only for foreigners to ride their bullet trains!>>><<<I studied abroad in Korea in 2018/19 about 50% wore masks even back then.>>><<<So cool that you get to do this with your son.>>><<<no..Lion Air is the Ryanair of Asia>>><<<All we need now, is the ambulance story.>>><<<How much was your Uber to Lano? 💰>>><<<Love a good business lounge. Disappointing when they&#39;re not up to par or my stopover isn&#39;t long enough to take full advantage. <a href="UCZqNme_MY-jl_1ziSr2VMjA/kbGCXon7Hsay_AOdzq6wCQ"></a>>>><<<Scoot has always been good for me. I don’t like the food choices on pre-order though.>>><<<Scoot looks considerably better than either EasyJet or Ryaniar>>><<<C&#39;mon mate. Fair crack of the whip. You&#39;ve gotta spill the beans on the ambo story.>>><<<When I hear the name Scoot, I can&#39;t help but think of a dog in a sitting type position dragging it&#39;s butt on a carpet to address an itch.>>><<<I cannot imagine the bill for an Uber all the way from Perth Airport to Lancelin.>>><<<They have been wearing masks in Asia longer than Covid; because of pollution.>>><<<Why not compare with Singapore airlines business to perth?>>><<<Good👍>>><<<Why would someone book a room in the name of someone who isn&#39;t present. Are you stupid or something?>>><<<For 50 Aussie bucks for a buffet brekkie, you&#39;d certainly want refills availability.>>><<<You got an uber to lanno? 😮>>><<<Your right about the masks here in Thailand still quite a few still wearing especially in malls and super markets>>><<<Asian airports don&#39;t seem to have same problems as UK strikes useless air traffic control etc>>><<<I love that ANA has Makers Mark. Rare to find in Asia as is bourbon in general. It&#39;s middle tier but a good bourbon.>>><<<woah whiskey is the key>>><<<American flying is nothing more than gray hound buses with wings and you are a cow being transported for slaughter.>>><<<Now you&#39;re leaving us with the ambulance story hanging!! 😂😂😂 Nicely done Sir.>>><<<Good content as usual. Not surprised to see/learn that more people in Asia are still masking up compared with Western countries…. Aren’t Asian countries more known for masking wearing traditionally compared with Western countries?>>><<<Ryanair actually fly to Asia mainly Asian Turkey but i think that they may go to Jordan too?They do Africa too.>>><<<Masks has always been a thing in Japan, Korea and Singapore well before COVID. Worn by people with the flu to minimise spread in public such as trains etc. It’s very thoughtful and I wish more Western countries would do the same even post-COVID most people in the West have reverted back to pre-COVID days of not wearing it when sick and spreading it in public.>>><<<Kym likes expensive short haul business class flights and liqueur. 😂<br>Journalism pays well it seems..>>><<<Flying direct into Nagoya is the pro option. Nice airport. And there’s an awesome sushi place underneath the main railway station.>>><<<You&#39;re like girls on Facebook looking for attention with your ambulance story.>>><<<Thanks for sharing.>>><<<I think the beer despinser is so that the beer poor properly without to much froth on the top>>><<<Love the One Bite Pizza Review style score. &quot;Score it like ice skating&quot;>>><<<Another stella video... love it love it love it... looking forward to the next ones>>><<<You deserve a medal after reviewing Scoot Plus! 😂<br>Good suggestion for a day time flight only.>>><<<Ah come on Kym ... ambulance?  You MUST TELL!>>><<<Direct flights from Perth to Tokyo start later this year so may be worth a try for next years race!>>><<<They do flights from Singapore to Athens I don&#39;t think I could cope with a 11 hour flight with no entertainment system>>><<<Ambulance?! Hope you and Jason are okay glad you made it home safe. Cheers, Kym till Qatar.>>><<<The reaction to Asiana stake is just priceless 😂>>><<<Arigato (wrong language) Kym-san.>>><<<Scoot is not the Ryanair of Asia. That designation belongs to AirAsia...yeesh!>>><<<AW HELL YEAH, I’ll stay passionate if you put that guy at the end of all your videos 😍>>><<<You, had a medical emergency, Kym? Looking forward to your ambulance video ;-)>>><<<Haha I did that non-reserved sardine train 4 times this time 😢>>><<<This is a version of the Planes Trains &amp; Automobile movie!!>>><<<That economy section behind scoot plus is my personal preference. Extra legroom seat, adjustable headrest, in a private mini-cabin, with fantastic engine views too. It’s called scoot in silence and for me, it’s slightly better value than scoot plus.>>><<<A bit unfair comparing them, Ryanair are usually pretty good.>>><<<The bottoms up beer dispenser was developed to speed up lines at games where they typically get slowed down by the head of beer settling.>>><<<We need the ambulance story, Kym!>>><<<$700 for a room? oh come on ... why encourage price gouging Hotels?>>><<<One does not simply glance over “an ambulance ride”, what happened in the ambo?!??>>><<<Why the ambulance? Nothing serius i hope. Take care.>>><<<big fan kym, keep up the good videos thanks>>><<<Ryan air of Asia is airasia bro>>><<<You should calculate how many hours a year your in the air.>>><<<That beer dispenser was designed to fill the cups with less foam and to help maximize the number of cups of beer out of a keg.>>><<<It isn&#39;t too bad :P>>><<<Ambulance ??!! 😂😅>>>
