He was asked to pick up one of the new planes from Boeing Field and bring it back to Atlanta. He and the copilot brought their wives with with them. The inside was like this with no seats, and the ladies were to sit in the jump seats during takeoff. The guys are jacked they had no load and requested to do an unrestricted takeoff and we’re given permission to do so. My mother-in-law had strapped her self in as they taxied, but the copilot’s wife kept farting around, exploring while they taxied to the runway. Well, the guys didn’t announce that they were getting ready to takeoff and she was still standing. My MiL said that this woman went ass over tea kettle in her skirt, the complete length of the plane till she hit the bulkhead at the back. She said she never laughed so hard in her life! The other woman got up quite indignant and stomped her way up to the front of the plane to yell at the two men. 

It’s always such a visual story that anytime I see a picture like this that’s all I can picture is this 50 year old woman rolling with her skirt over her head down the whole length.>>><<<I worked on it.

Installation checks are “did we do it right” and rectify. Subsequent checks (such as light or deep maintenance, or in this case C and D) are to make sure that it’s holding up as per design or assumed degradation rate. 

Saying “it’s ok C and D checks will pick it up” is poor practice and should not be relied upon in isolation, and is just a Swiss cheese incident waiting to happen.>>><<<Kinda like that whole fiasco about not allowing a pilot to get back into a cockpit when locked from the inside, right?>>><<<Let me tell you about the first 100 shipsets of warped composite floor beams.

We should NOT be relying on the various mid-life maintenance inspections to pick up basic design and construction failures.>>><<<
There is no indication that the 787 has massive structural issues based on their age despite the allegations. Also, all aircraft have basic design and construction failures. These issues are not exclusive to Boeing, aircraft have AD’s and other campaigns used to address these issues as they become known.

Airbus with Thales Avionics DDRMI need checked due to problems that result in failure and ERJs aft cargo doors have issues staying closed which need checked. ADs are released and are active for both airframes to address those issues, it happens. I’ve personally corrected many varying issues found on different aircraft manufactured by Boeing and other companies. 

Point being; as long as people design and build aircraft there will be design and construction failures like this regardless of who makes the aircraft. Sometimes it takes one or more instances of failure to discover the problems.>>><<<Ok, again, you are missing the point.>>><<<Am I? Most of these posts and the comments on them are driven by unfounded conspiracies surrounding whistleblower John Barnett’s death. I’ll wait until the investigation is complete before claiming ignorantly there’s an issue with Boeing quality; especially when it is unsupported based on statistical data on reliability and safety.

Every time a tire goes flat on a Boeing aircraft these days there are 1,000 social media posts about how awful Boeing aircraft are which is dumb. In these posts people comment presuming issues that may not even exist.>>><<<I knew John loooong ago during my 787 days.

"Is this wrong?"




"Yes."




"Is it going to break in service?"




"Unlikely."




"If it does, will it be a safety of flight issue?"




"No."




"Ship it! Put a note in the maintenance book."






Safety should be #1, but remember, there's a lot of logistics and business making happening involved. The trick is to beat up Business Daddy, take his lunch money and do it right without going out of business. Or Nationalize Boeing. >>><<<Off topic, but your comment made me learn about the existence/name of these checks.

Thank you, I always like to learn more about aviation :)>>><<<They have very little metal on them. Most of the structure of the 787 is cfrp>>><<<Composites can still fatigue, and the fatigue behaviour of them is far more variable and less understood than in metals. That’s mainly because there is such a large variety of what composite materials. Lay up, the resin matrix, curing are all things which can vary and each combination could have its own fatigue behaviour. There are also more failure modes in a composite - delaminating, resin failure, fibre breakage debonding of the fibre and matrix etc.>>><<<I know that. That’s why I pointed it out. 

Composites that were drilled wrong is far more concerning from a fatigue life perspective than metals due to their catastrophic rather than gradual failure modes.>>><<<They’re composite though>>><<<There have been problems. Even a few major ones. Missing countersinks. Swage fasteners 3 to 4 grips too long.  An issue with the 47 section called tiger striping. Shims, lots of shim issues.

I have no idea how their software is architected, but as a developer, it seems absolutely insane that they need a system to filter out stale data from the live flight displays.  Why the hell is stale data being actively processed in the first place? Is something replaying logged data on whatever com bus the displays use?

Mostly no. They all have their flaws, but the engineers for the 787 say there are some pretty major ones.

There is a big difference in having flaws and being flawed. I know it semantics, but I think it makes a big difference.>>><<<I think the biggest issue here is the safety culture. Like even if these defects / issues that this engineer inspected turned out to be nothing major, he was pretty much ignored and transferred for doing his job properly.

If Boeing is encouraging this type of culture and only rewarding / hiring engineers that overlook issues, it will manifest massively in the future to something super critical.>>><<<They've been flying for a decade now and the only issue has been with battery fires, how major can a flaw be if it never manifests?

the design spec that longevity assumptions go out the window>>><<<Looks like the 787 doesn't need a D Check until 12 years, so the oldest ones should be up for them in the next couple years - I guess we'll find out soon whether there's anything to this.>>><<<It’s not just time that will get it in D check, it’s airframe hours.>>><<<Even then, most airframes will not encounter the boundaries of the design envelope wrt gust loads, maneuver loads, hard landing loads etc.>>><<<I pray no crashes before the checks>>><<<That's why Boeing pays so much for Lawyers.>>><<<What a silly question.

All of the 787s that were already in service continued flying and would get fixed at a scheduled maintenance check>>><<<Airplanes are buckets of bolts strung together with engineering and production hope and a good pilot.

Wouldn’t it make sense that he was reassigned to 777? Also, being transferred from program to program really doesn’t seem like an abnormal thing for a company as big as Boeing that manufactures different models all under one roof in Everett?

Btw I get that “jumping up and down on parts to make them fit” is a funny and maybe shocking visual to some but let’s remember we’re talking about 10,000+ solid one piece CFRP barrel sections here. You could drop an f150 on these sections and doubtful they deflect more than a 1/1,000th of an inch. In reality the engineering defined pull up allowance is probably beyond the force anyone jumping up and down is doing imo.>>><<<The front hasn't fallen off of one yet.>>><<<Don't see the issue really. They've been in service for almost 13 years already and if the issues are only about shortened life-span, than surely any structural damage to the fuselage will pop up in one of the many maintenance checks over the decades and not just suddenly and unexpectedly happen from one day to the other.

I mean, other aircraft like the A380 also have issues with cracks, but they fortunately are identified before causing any trouble.>>><<<I guess the main issue is where is the gaps that were not joined properly, what are the stresses at the point and are they inspected and how often if they are. That will determine a lot regarding the danger here. 

All aircraft get fatigue cracks and parts rub and wear against each other, you just hope the aircraft is inspected at the right time to identify these issues and put corrective actions in place.>>><<<"Salehpour’s attorneys said the FAA was surprised to discover through his complaint that the gaps were still an issue."

This is especially true for companies that are in the media a lot. The government will want to make an example of them because everyone in Washington works more on emotion than logic and facts.

About the attorneys. They will generally work on contingent basis and will get 20% of the cash, which still leaves the whistleblower with a decent amount of money.

Serious though. The 777 is great and beautiful and the best Boeing I’ve flown. That being said I know the 787 is even better. Boeing just keeps fixing things us pilots didn’t even know needed fixing. Ha.

Why plane makers still put in the throttle stick for the engines? Just tradition or is there another use for having an actual stick instead of a smaller handle or even a guage on the control column?>>><<<Being able to easily and quickly adjust power is crucial to flying any plane by hand. Pilots should always have the ability to adjust the thrust produced by each engine without having to look at the position. 

In the same way you wouldn’t want a car with a dial instead of a gas pedal, a pilot wants to be able to hand fly the plane with control over thrust, pitch, roll, and yaw being easily accessible without needing to look at any of the input locations.

Furthermore, thrust levers give an appropriate level of granularity that is less easily achieved using something like a small stick or dial. This allows small adjustments to the airspeed without needing to look at the throttle control or “think” about where you are positioning it. You can adjust by the feedback you feel from the plane and/or your indicated air speed depending on situation>>><<<Thanks for explanation. Appreciate it and I understand.>>><<<So Boeing no longer uses the beige color for the instrument panel.>>><<<Good old 'Beaver Brown'>>><<<I fly both the 777 and the 787 and I like them both very much. The 787 has lots of nice bells and whistles that are missing on the 777 not to mention lower cabin altitude and fresher air, but if I had to choose one the triple wins in my books.

I prefer a CDU with real buttons, real window shades that can be rolled in and out quickly, and a larger crew rest. More tactile buttons and less messing around with a mouse that jumps all over the place, especially when it's turbulent.

Newer isn't always better.>>><<<Pardon…what does this mouse manage? 

Can’t wait for the episode of Mayday where a horrific crash was caused by a jittery mouse in turbulence>>><<<He has a point right? A mouse shouldn't be something that jumps about in turbulence.>>><<<I wanted more explanation on what this mouse does, because yes that makes 0 sense>>><<<There's a trackpad to control the cursor on the CDU etc. Even though you can buy a perfectly good one cheaply for your laptop, these make the cursor jump around even in still air. You are required to use it a lot on the 787 because the CDU has no physical buttons.>>><<<So as a pilot, doesn't the lack of physical buttons introduce some level of risk that could be avoided? Especially during turbulence? Or am I incorrect?>>><<<Yes. Putting a trackpad in that is often difficult to control and using it for so many basic functions was a solution looking for a problem. The original design called for touchscreens, but this wasn't certified by the FAA. Even touchscreens would have been a step back from physical buttons. Even car manufacturers have figured out that touchscreens in a vehicle are a bad idea and are going back to real buttons and switches.>>><<<All beautiful except the touchscreen FMS. I feel like it would be a pain>>><<<It’s not touchscreen, you use a trackpad (small humps by the thrust levers) to manipulate the FMS. Still should have kept physical buttons though.>>><<<Ah I see. I stand corrected>>><<<I don't think you were wrong to begin with. Trackpads are still a pain compared to real buttons.>>><<<&gt; t’s not touchscreen, 

Weird, considering every other FMS since the 737 has been touchscreen.

Just why?>>><<<Since when did Yokes become a bad thing?>>><<<Since side sticks became a thing.>>><<<Airbus has used side sticks. Boeing has Alexis used yokes. Boeing and Airbus are the largest commercial aviation giants ever>>><<<I know. I’ve flown both and I’m a smart ass stating my preference.>>><<<As a non-pilot, but someone who does have to work with their hands (doctor), I’m curious as to how muscle memory works with side sticks. For years you train and learn to fly by the right hand and then you get promoted and fly with the left. Does that ever cause any problems in critical situations (where you may need to disconnect auto pilot)?

In surgery, we often practice skills ambidextrously from the beginning. However, there is clearly a side predominance to the right hand. In most surgeries, the lead surgeon stands on the patient’s right side. Most surgical instruments are right handed. We flip to the left side because of the patient’s position or left hand if it has better access / ergonomics than the right for a certain step. So a professor may be teaching a resident how to operate from the patient’s left side (think of this like a check captain). However, when they need to take over, it’s not like they just say “my airplane”. They’ll call a switch and physically switch sides with the other person. 

I’m wondering if a yoke is better because, while the sight lines are different, the hand dominance is the same>>><<<You also primarily use the right hand for the yoke in the right seat, and left hand on the yoke in the left seat, just like the sidestick.>>><<<Exactly, outside hand for flight controls, inside hand for thrust levers. It takes a couple of hours to adjust but then you’re fine.>>><<<

I like yoke like this because it offers nice tactile feedback about what the PF is doing.

I know Airbus has a cursor on the PFD but I feel tactile is best. Airbus sticks are not digitally linked.

There's a sidenote to this. Planes like the G600 &amp; MC21 have Sidesticks but unlike Airbus they ARE digitally linked (Active Sidesticks).

If you wiggle the captain's sidestick on MC21 the FO sidestick also wiggles. Excellent tactile feedback specially during an emergency.

Doesn’t change the fact that the 787 cockpit looks like cheap plastic and you’ll note the 787 cockpit looks nothing like any other Boeing cockpit.

The B-52 crash happened from a pilot who kept pushing the limits and was trying to show off, got way too slow at a low altitude and couldn’t recover.>>><<<It was his last flight too his whole family was on the flight line watching, massive tragedy>>><<<He was one of the pilots but not the one known for pushing the limits and hot dogging. The one who's family was there was flying because everyone else refused.>>><<<I always heard it told the other way, XOs last flight (who was the one known for hotdogging and who JOs did not want to fly with) so his family was there with him and everything .>>><<<Nope, Lt Col Bud Holland was the hot dogger and it was the fini flight for the vice wing commander, Col Rob Wolff, who's family was there to celebrate his final flight in the AF.

Bud's family was possibly there too but it wasn't (supposed to be) his fini.>>><<<Dang did not know that thanks>>><<<What b52 video?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I googled and found, but thanks>>><<<https://youtu.be/amjKlwwssmw>>><<<I googled it, but thanks>>><<<It’s basically a wrap livery that was testing out technology.

Certainly added some nice color to the A stalls when it was at BFI>>><<<Proper big stab helps against Dutch roll>>><<<I hope the tray tables were in the stowed position and the seat belt lights were on.>>><<<Stowed ‘and locked’ position.>>><<<She's built like a steakhouse but she handles like a bistro>>><<<r/unexpectedfuturama>>><<<Won't these things pretty much do a completely vertical climb when empty?>>><<<Empty weight is 250-300k lbs, thrust is 70-76k lbf per side, so no, they can't come anywhere near vertical without bleeding energy.  But if you put the camera ship in the right place, you can make it look like it can.>>><<<While its steep its usually 45deg max takeoff pitch at the airshow. Very cool tho! Most comm flights are 15 max.>>><<<MD-80 has entered the chat>>><<<Empty weight: 284000 lb

Engine thrust: 71000 lbf x 2 = 142000lb

Thrust is not greater than weight therefore no vertical.

And fully loaded is usually about a third. Holds true for a surprising amount of planes.>>><<<There's this retired old BA/Air France ship that had just shy of 160,000lb thrust and 178,000lb  empty weight, might have been an interesting air show bird.>>><<<Still, a thrust/weight ratio of almost 0.5 is extremely impressive.>>><<<Whilst the video is cool - can someone explain what's special about it?  Simply how steep it's banking?>>><<<Um yeah, that bank angle is insane.>>><<<I'm just imagining the BANK ANGLE BANK ANGLE warnings blaring while the pilot's got a big smile on>>><<<Bank angle sexy afffff>>><<<Makes sense. That's something you'd expect out of a fighter jet, not a giant commercial airliner.>>><<<If you were in the cockpit you’d be impressed.>>><<<And if you were a passenger you’d be shitting your pants.>>><<<Only Air France flies passengers in air shows.>>><<<I'm wondering too. 

Although I'm sure 90 degree banking is not in the owner's manual.>>><<<awesome! i saw the 777X pull the same bank when i was at DAS2021. couldn't stop smiling when it did that!>>><<<Impressive. Steep climb to hard left bank, creating the potential for accelerated stall, while low and slow. But plane and pilot execute it perfectly.>>><<<Didn’t even really lose altitude when he flattened it out on top either. Really impressive maneuver for such a huge airplane.>>><<<BANK angle BANK angle>>><<<Really gonna turn some heads when you also paint the wings. No one does that.>>><<<Serious question. I realise the plane makers are showing off to the public and trying to woo potential buyers but I’ve never understood how aerobatics help sell a commercial plane. Anyone ?>>><<<Shows how safe and capable it is.>>><<<Thanks for answering! Military planes I get but just doesn’t seem that relevant for commercial planes. They’d have passengers, freight and more fuel on board. Would those manoeuvres still be viable under those circumstances? And if not then why bother?🤔>>><<<In a lot of cases, maneuvers like that can still be performed (depends on a lot of factors) with the plane loaded if it absolutely has to.

Same logic applies as to why aircraft manufacturers apply more load to the wings during testing than the aircraft would ever conceivably face during normal operations. They need to make sure that it's capable of performing and enduring the most extreme stunts, just in case it has to.>>><<<Great answer. Thanks!>>><<<Sure thing. :)>>><<<Well when I am sitting in turbulence and I think about videos like this that I have watched, i am much less nervous. In the old days I was a wreck.>>><<<It does seem relevant when you think of the planes that couldn't pull off these trucks. Look at the Tu-144 and what happened at the Paris Air Show. Basically killed it commercially.>>><<<“Aeronautics” here is a loose term lol>>><<<“Approved for chandelles, lazy-8 not to exceed 60 degrees angle of bank”

Def not in the company manual.

After I washed out of military pilot training I went on to finish my CPL (civvy commercial) My ego was real bruised from the wash out, but my instructor was the most awesome chill dude, and it was the first time I ever flew with a real sense of working together and teaching each other. 

So we discussed it, and worked through a few textbook lazy-8 in the old c-172 (which he owned) . 

Pilots often talk about design limits. Being that there’s regulatory limits and company limits. 

It was a good moment to sooth my broken ego just a little bit at the time.>>><<<So.... he turned left?>>><<<He wasn't an ambi-turner. Well, until now.>>><<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDeZ-H8QOU&amp;t=11s>>><<<This guy knows some maneuvers>>><<<Not every plane is built to withstand the forces behind these types of movements. Passenger planes have a maximum angle they can bank before the plane is at risk of deteriorating from such a harsh movement (usually maxing out at 45 degrees, if I remember correctly). Obviously this varies a bit between models.

So yeah, if this was like most other planes we would be watching this pilots last moments instead.>>><<<You should read the comments and learn why this is a crazy move for a plane like this.>>><<<Believe it or not, when I posted my comment, there were all of two other comments in this thread and I read them both.>>><<<Winning move? It's not a contest...well at least in our common definition of the word.>>><<<Do you make this complaint every time you hear about someone's winning smile?>>><<<“Bank Angle”>>><<<Nothing will ever beat the 707 barrel roll.  The pilot got SCREAMED at by Boeing when he landed like "what are you DOING?!" and his response "selling airplanes".  

This actually happened.>>><<<look how the wings flex... WOW>>><<<I can hear the female voice in the cabin "bank angle, bank angle". I think I had too many aviation videos on YouTube.>>><<<60 years ago - barrel roll. Now - left turn>>><<<Looks like a fucking whale and I love it !!>>><<<People often forget that when empty, these things have a bucketload of additional thrust to weight ratio>>><<<when are they gonna let test pilots 1g roll airliners again?>>><<<I kind of want to know what it feels like to be sitting in the rear most bathroom while they perform this move lol>>><<<Weeeeeeee!!>>><<<Pshhh. That’s nothing. 747’s used to barrel roll during air shows.>>><<<Lol....ok.>>><<<It was a 707. The 747 only did it in trials in Seattle. Still pretty cool though.>>><<<If I'm remembering my aviation history correct, and I may be wrong, the USAF were auditioning for the next generation refuelers...it was the B-707 vs. the DC-8. Tex Johnson was the Boeing pilot doing the flyby and decided to do the barrel roll in front of the assembled crowd. The AF people loved it and Boeing got the contract...and we still have modified B-707's 50 years later in the form of E-3's, KC-135's, and JSTARS.>>><<<No, the 747 didn't. MAYBE in a SIM, but it did not happen IRL.>>><<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDeZ-H8QOU>>><<<When flying yesterday I think the pilot did a turn pretty close that honestly, banked like more than 45 degrees.

Edit: in a 737-800.>>><<<Ok, and? This doesn't make the airliner any better

Great video though>>><<<The LM-100J went inverted at an air show tho.>>><<<Is he doing an Immelmann?>>><<<Amazing bird>>><<<Get in the notch>>><<<Well if you were directly above the crowd then how could you see the crowd ?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I was inverted, ma'am.>>><<<yes, because obviously these planes can do this fully loaded, like that A400 doing those crazy turns for that promo vid>>><<<so smooth>>><<<Lol hope the pax got centrifuge training>>><<<Bank Angle!

So you get new problems. 

Having a big mass (engine) in front has a stabilising effect. If you compare engine types and flexibility over generations you can see that with increasing flexibility (and engine mass) the engine moves forward.>>><<<You would think fatigue becomes a problem if it wiggles...?>>><<<Fatigue would still be a problem even if the motion was minimal. It’s more about cyclic loading than displacement. The structure can (and is) designed to be able to withstand many cycles without failing due to fatigue, enough to survive the aircraft’s entire life.>>><<<Fatigue is such a well studied thing by now in aviation and materials/metallurgy, surely planes are extremely overengineered to avoid any catastrophic fatigue failures. And there is also constant inspection for fatigue cracks, replacement etc. Those single crystal turbine blades seem to be the only issue bc flaws can be hard to detect and one fails occasionally (e.g., southwest 1380)>>><<<But what is stopping catastrophic oscillation...   I mean, Im sure they account for all this crap, but I want to know so I feel better, and not think of those old suspension bridges tearing themselves apart before we knew better.>>><<<Those are called resonance frequencies, and you can bet your ass they measure those and damp them by introducing parts which change the frequency if it is found to overlap with natural vibrational modes.>>><<<Counterpoint: it's Boeing.>>><<<Like an onomatopoeia?>>><<<Same reason that any building generally over 10 floors is designed to move and sway in wind.>>><<<It's absolutely fascinating isn't it?

We have a Pilot in our family and he always tells me *flexibility=durability*.

 He's currently flying the Dreamliner coming from a cargo 767 and even he was shocked when he saw the wings flex for the first time. (Don't worry about the engines and the wings they are designed to endure much much more than that.) 

That plane is nothing short of a masterpiece. The engineering behind it is amazing. 

•Larger dimmable windows

•Loud noise reducing chevrons 

•Low fuel consumption 

And the Dreamliner has an airframe comprising nearly 50% carbon fiber reinforced plastic and other composites.

It's by far the most comfortable airliner I've had the chance to fly with.>>><<<The one thing about the dimmable windows is they don’t go completely opaque. I’ve had a 787 flight heading west where the blazing late evening sun was shining through the “dimmed” window for about six hours. We were flying at a speed that stopped the sun from fully setting for a long time.>>><<<I actually loved them. Used them as a solar filter to take a photo of the sun with my Pixel 8 Pro. Caught a fuckin sunspot even! Check it out!!

https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/s/V4EAARJU1b>>><<<I’m told this is why a lot of regulars prefer the A350. Have flown on a 787, and while the windows were clever, I didn’t care for them. Not had a chance to fly on an A350 to compare.>>><<<I love flying on both for different reasons. I like the large, dimmable windows on the Dreamliner whereas most a350s have tail cams that we can watch live feed from the seat>>><<<That’s interesting. I loved them, personally. I liked being able to dim the cabin while still having a bit of a view.>>><<<I've been on a few where cabin crew have disabled the dimming buttons on each individual window. I liked the ability to choose>>><<<The other thing is that the crew can remotely control them which I can totally get for takeoff and landing but it is frustrating if you are claustrophobic.>>><<<Flip side, the benefit the whole cabin gets when they are autodimmed in the blazing sun. 

Prevents that one person from having their blind fully open. 

I know there’s a lot to be said about doing what you want if you’ve paid for a window seat, but if you are the only person insistent on having your window open, and it’s absolutely blinding another passenger.. you’re kinda an asshole.>>><<<I don't know why people are downvoting this. I was on an 8-hour flight to the US last week in the aisle seat. Person on the window seat left their window open and was just sleeping the whole time, while the rest of the row got blinded most of the way. Close it if you're not looking at the view.>>><<<Feel the same way about them! I was excited that I could dim them without completely blocking the view, but once I had the sun on my side for most of the 14~ hours it takes from the US to Japan, I didn't want to live that ever again XD

I actually got curious and searched if they were being put in the 737 MAX and 777X, was surprised to find they aren't on the MAX, but I'm [glad to read](https://simpleflying.com/boeing-777x-fuselage/) at least that the 777X will have ones that are "100 times darker" and "blocking out 99.999% of light". Would at least alleviate that problem you mention :)>>><<<There's a reason why the electronic shades are an option on the 777x even though they're supposed to block more light and work faster>>><<<I will forever marvel at this aircraft. Heard that it’s a lot smoother of a ride because of that wingflex. Definitely need to fly on one soon.>>><<<I flew the 787 and my eyes nearly popped out of my sockets watching the wing flex upward during takeoff, it is a heck of an experience, even after a 10 hour flight, I felt well rested, it is an amazing plane to fly in.>>><<<It is. Mild turbulence feels more like you’re on a boat gently sloshing on waves than a plane 10,000m in the air. The A350 and 787 are marvellous planes.>>><<<CFRP technology is amazing and only getting better and hopefully longevity will increase too. Making these things fly more efficiently and for longer is the main goal...>>><<<I flew on the semi similar A380 and it was such a comfortable flight.

Next to no pressure change in the cabin if you have sensitive ears, its significantly quieter.

Take off doesn't even feel like takeoff, the plane just starts to go up and you dont even feel it.>>><<<The composite construction also allows a higher humidity level which greatly promotes comfort on a 10+ hour flight>>><<<As well as a lower effective cabin altitude (higher internal cabin air pressure) means more oxygen to the brain means less fatigue (apparently).>>><<<Awesome isn't it. Love the 787 despite the recent debacle with Boeing.>>><<<I fly both the 787 and the 777. You feel better after a 787 flight. But I’d take the 777 every day as a pilot.>>><<<The composite frame allows both higher pressurization due to tensile strength (closer to sea level) and higher humidity (no metallic oxidation concerns). Dreamliner indeed…

But let me know when you get to pilot the 777x for a true comparison>>><<<It honestly doesn’t seem to make that much of a difference to cabin pressure. You start a flight at around 6000’ cabin alt. The difference is the 787 stays at that level for an entire long haul flight where the 777 slowly creeps upwards with each step climb.>>><<<A lot of the noise reduction is actually the ultra high bypass ratio on the engine which creates a sound cushioning airflow buffer around the engine. It’s mostly just a serendipitous byproduct from a more fuel efficient engine design (as far as I can tell)>>><<<The 747 has [wobbly wings too](https://youtube.com/shorts/wNXiY3jcE2I?feature=shared). In my experience, Airbus leans towards stiffer designs while Boeing tends to allow more flex.

(Both can be perfectly safe, for the record - it's just a design philosophy difference, not a safety or quality difference)>>><<<Yeah the 744 has some amazing wing flex. I was kinda surprised that the 748 didn’t have nearly the same amount of flex. And, I could feel it being a bit stiffer in the turbulence. I asked the pilots after a flight if they felt the same way and they affirmed that the 748 can be a rougher ride.>>><<<Yeah… I know why this happens and I know that it’s completely meant to, but it still makes me uncomfortable to see the wing flex and watch those engines wobble like that. I remember seeing it properly for the first time in an A380 flying in turbulent air on the way to Kuala Lumpur… I genuinely thought the engines were going to fall off!>>><<<Geee…that flex..no GE..>>><<<Strongest wings in the business. Really something to see in action. I was able to watch the wing stress test when they finally broke a wing which took an insane amount of force and way past the flex even engineers had planned for.>>><<<I remember being more weirded out when the overhead bins shook like a cocktail mixer after we landed.>>><<<It’s flapping it’s wings to stay in the air …common sense!>>><<<Still blows my mind they were able to model fatigue of composites well enough to produce an FAA-certified widebody in the mid 2000s>>><<<Amazing what access to DoD research and personnel will get you in the private sector.>>><<<Don't forget hiring former FAA employees 🫡>>><<<There is actually probably a pretty strict firewall around that DOD data. You'd never get permission to export a plane with composites that the DOD didn't want exported (or really any other tech the DOD funded to develop a strategic or tactical advantage).

Now, access to the *engineers* who at one point worked on DOD projects? That is another story.>>><<<That's pretty much my point, but razor cut down from the implication I meant about former DoD personnel and, specifically, those individuals' experience with DoD materials.


I didn't intend it to mean access to the actual classified DoD docs, but I wasn't specific enough to avoid that conclusion. >>><<<Can someone translate this for the passengers in the sub?>>><<<Composite: two or more materials put together to become a new improved material. The most commonly used in aerospace industry are Carbon Fiber and Fiber Glass, both reinforcing some kind of resin. The specifics of the fibers and the resin vary, but in general these structures are much lighter for the same resistance when compared to traditional materials (Aluminium for instance)

Fatigue: A structure, when subjected to loadings that vary in time (for instance, the wings flexing in turbulence, or the cabin being pressurised and depressurised every flight) can suffer from a phenomenon called Fatigue, when tiny cracks may arise in it and get aggravated until it eventually fails. BUT, the structure can and will be designed to take that into account. The resistance to fatigue depends on several factors, but to keep it simple, you can make a structure that will only fail due to fatigue after an inconceivably large amount of time, making it essentially, for all practical applications, having an infinite useful lifetime. 

To do that, you need a model. A mathematical one, that’s going to be run in a computer simulation. We have equations that tell us how these materials and structures behave under several conditions. The more accurate the result, the more complex and long is the modelling of the structure. 

The thing is, composite materials behave in very particular ways which makes them notoriously hard to model mathematically and thus, makes it hard to get accurate results from these simulations. Which is why it’s very impressive that the Boeing guys actually did a very good job at modelling the composite structures of the 787. Also, to work around the difficulties of the computer models, many of the simulations are then confirmed by real life testing, which gives the empirical results needed for the full trust on the design. 

If you have any more questions or if I failed to make some of this more clear, feel free to ask>>><<<Right, all of that, but why was that surprising in the mid-2000s? Have the models really gotten that much better in 15 or 20 years?>>><<<To be honest, I can’t give you a very precise answer on the accuracy of these models 20 years ago, since by then I was only 3. But I can tell you, from what I’ve been learning in aerospace engineering school, that they have become considerably better during the last few years. Although composites have been in use for several decades now and the basic math underlying it is even older, the extensive use of composites for a whole structure is relatively recent. The application of theory might also be trickier than one would imagine and as the demand rises, so do the research for it and much research is being made around composites recently. Also, as computers get more powerful, so do the simulations, and many of these are only feasible with very powerful computers. And lastly, it’s also due to the company’s experience with the material they’re working with. These simulations will give you an answer, whether it’s right or wrong and it’s up for the engineering team to figure out if their job was well done. With the recent focus on composites for high end products in the aerospace industry, all of these things have improved significantly over the past years.>>><<<Isn't it also because most composites are not isotropic like plastic or metal. They're stronger in some directions than others, making it very computationally complex to simulate. Carbon and glass fiber for instance>>><<<Yes! I tried to keep it as simple as possible, but you’re exactly right. Due to that, composite materials also present some weird deformation modes. For instance, by applying an axial force, you can get it to bend, which doesn’t happen to isotropic materials. All of that adds to the complexity of the model>>><<<Is that why in, e.g., F1 cars, the direction the carbon fibre is weaved (?) matters for their aerodynamics?>>><<<It’s possible yeah. I can’t say for sure, because I know very little about F1 aerodynamics, but I do know they make very good use of aeroelasticity effects, that is, they use the natural deformation of the wings due to aerodynamic forces to improve the aerodynamics of the car. And that is linked to the way they deform and thus the way they are built.>>><<<These aircraft were also built with massive safety factors with respect to fatigue. Not sure off the top of my head, but iirc well above 100x safety factor above what was calculated. Not sure how much better it has gotten, but certainly at the time, fatigue of composites was very poorly understood.>>><<<Most planes' component safety factors are below 2 due to weight and budget constraint.>>><<<True for load factors! But for fatigue tolerance it can be a lot higher. It's not just about materials either, you can improve fatigue 'safety factor' by increasing inspection or replacement frequency, etc.

You're right though in that for fatigue it's not normally called a 'safety factor''. I just used that language because people know what it means.>>><<<Yeah, this guy engineers>>><<<Today a stress analyst runs a FEM on their laptop before lunch. 20 years ago would have taken a dedicated high performance machine a two days to solve that same FEM. It's not the model, it's Moore's Law.

edit: clarity>>><<<Think about your desktop PC in the early 2000s. The phone in your hand blows that out of the water in terms of compute power>>><<<Others have mentioned computing power - committed are approximately 32x more powerful today than they were 20 years ago - but another thing to keep in mind is that, while we've known the equations for these models since the 60s and 70s (with refinements in the 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, and even still today), we're still gathering the data to actually feed into them. To simulate a mechanical structure (or really anything), you need:

* computing resources
* mathematical models
* empirical data on the materials being studied

For example, a subsonic fluid simulation can be run on a powerful desktop commuter today, the models for subsonic for are well understood, and we have entire databases of fluid properties like specific weight, specific volume, surface tension, viscosity, etc, and all of those values for different temperatures and pressures. But that's today. In the 2000s, these databases were rare and probably proprietary. In the 90s and 80s, they were probably more like tables and charts, and you had to interpolate the values you actually wanted (and pray that there wasn't some weird phenomenon that existed right at the values you were interpolating). Running those simulations were just as computationally expensive then at they are today, but computer resources were more rare, so you'd simplify your models and/or simulations, because all the engineers had to essentially share the same computers (mainframes just for running simulations), and you couldn't hog it for a full week without a very good reason.

So, we have more powerful computers. We have more advanced models, and we have larger and more detailed datasets about more and more materials. We can model a lot these days, a lot more than we could even a decade or two ago.>>><<<This is a great answer, thanks>>><<<Man this comment section has beautifully become a nice engineering discussion>>><<<Models have improved but it's often about numbers. Simplifying things slightly, you break something up into little triangles (or other shapes) and then each link in the triangle is solved for with a set of equations. and then it's neighbors. More computing power let's you solve more triangles faster giving you quicker results or finer resolution with your triangles. 

The design started around 2003. That year AMD released the first 64bit consumer computer chip. Apple released iTunes and Android released. Friendster and the Pirate Bay launched. CAPTCHAS were published at an idea. Mozilla Foundation was founded. MySpace and the Wikimedia foundation were founded. 

A lot has changed in software and hardware capabilities.>>><<<My company writes the software that does this sort of simulation modelling but for a different industry. The compute power and time required to accurately simulate different conditions is immense. Like we run our models on not just one server, but clusters of super high performance servers that measure their ram in terabytes.

Doing this in the 2000s would have been insane, we are talking about resources probably costing hundreds of millions, if not billions.>>><<<The math involved is really complicated and the fibers are so thin that it is really hard to precisely fabricate according to the mathematical predictions.

But in practice, the industry is really really conservative, so it took them decades to develop standards in order to certify this new type of material, slower than the progress of material modelling>>><<<It was unlocked by alien tech reverse engineering.

Joking here.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<You're assuming they modeled it at all.>>><<<FYI they requested a local large aerospace manufacturer to do an analysis on their structure &amp; manufacturing processes but weren’t happy with the price so they never followed through. Oooops.>>><<<They went with the equally accurate methodology of praying that it works>>><<<I mean... Sure? The fact they bought expired composites didn't help, either. Nor did the fact that the composites they used were intended for tension loads, and they were putting it under a compression cycle.

I think i saw once the fan blades have such a tiny clearance to the fan case.. on the order of a millimeter or two (?) and how do they not crash into the nacelle.>>><<<The nacelle interior is apparently coated in an abradable liner that can be safely worn down by fan blade rub.

Good thread on this phenomenon here: https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1393291>>><<<I've had the opportunity to inspect the inside of a jet engine with a borescope and what amazed me is that they use a metal honeycomb structure on the inside of the casing that is designed to easily be worn away by the blades themselves to to ensure the tightest fit possible.

My mom was freaking out and couldn't sleep for the entire flight because the plane was too quiet and also because when we went through a bit of turbulence the engine was wiggling like in this video, my dad being the pilot he is was as calm and unfazed as a easter island statue and my brother was getting motion sickness looking at it resulting in me bursting of laughter>>><<<The 🗿 reference is legendary😂>>><<<If it makes you feel better, it'll flex around 25 feet before snapping, although I personally wouldn't want to witness that much flex myself.>>><<<I visited one of the factories where they make these and they claimed that they demonstrated the wing flex by bending them upwards until they touched each other's tips.>>><<<That should’ve been recorded and put in the safety video for passengers, as someone who’d be put off by the engine flex this would definitely put me at ease 😂>>><<<That's an exaggeration, but they can flex [really quite far without breaking](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2010/03/index.jpg).>>><<<Not quite that far, but about **154**% max loads that the plane could ever experience in flight, which is about 45 degrees up.

It was also the first plane I was on where I didn't see any speed tape>>><<<This is the first time I've seen an engine wobbling. Since the engine wobbles sideways, is it correct to assume it contributes to the shaking of the aircraft (because it changes the direction of the exhaust, thereby causing oscillation)?>>><<<The wobbling you are seeing is barely a few degrees in either direction and it's mostly the nacelle moving. The change in exhaust velocity is negligible.>>><<<Nah you really don’t feel anything, it’s wild.

Some older models of aircraft had bolts that at specific harmonic frequencies or stresses would self sheer dropping the engine if something went really wrong

If you take a low to the ground plane and keep stretching it, such as, say, the 737, you get pretty close to the ground on rotate and landing.

For reference, the liftoff attitude at Flaps 1 for a 737-900ER is 8°. Tailstrike pitch attitude is 10°.

Interestingly the majority of tailstrikes will actually happen on landing, when you’re slowing a little too much and you perhaps bounce and don’t control the energy super well. It’s amazing how fast 10° can get there.>>><<<Thanks for sharing real world information.>>><<<Absolute madlad taking off at flaps 1>>><<<It’s actually amazing the amount of times you will.>>><<<That was the most common takeoff flap setting when I flew the 73NG>>><<<Real men take off with spoilers extended.>>><<<And thrust reversers>>><<<https://youtu.be/4QJRgfN6ZVI>>><<<I miss that man and every day I wait for Ryan Gosling to pick up his mantle.>>><<<True story He (Leslie Nielsen) spent a lot of his last years as a Bch Club member / Guest at my ex’s resort in FLa.

I am tall, 201cm, my knee rested under the airbrake lever, pressed up against it. Anyway, this particular launch we hit a bump in the grass before rotate and my knee hit the lever and unlocked it. With the rest of the noise I didn't notice (everyone on the ground heard the thunk!) Half way up the launch the airbrakes open fully, presumably sucked open by the airflow over the wing? I remember shouting to the instructor behind me before I slammed the lever closed, very confused. Ironically, it was my highest launch of the day!>>><<<Lol it takes a LOT of power to climb with full spoilers. Thankfully a winch checks that box lol.

Yeeeeehaaaaaw>>><<<Which glider is that?>>><<<ASH 26E>>><<<I am very curious what glider that would be. That sounds like a very weird feature.>>><<<It's actually fairly common in high performance gliders.  It pushes some of the air that would normally pass beside the ailerons over them instead.  The ailerons are quite slim from front to back and it aids in their effectiveness at single digit airspeeds.>>><<<With the parking brake set too>>><<<Why are the wings coming out, Mav?>>><<<For some reason that line really annoyed me. I mean all of the other willing suspension of disbelief aside, I can’t believe that a Top Gun grad (and allegedly one of the best, at that) wouldn’t understand why one would extend the wings on an F-14 (or that they can)>>><<<I took it as “why are you extending the wings now on this taxiway? We aren’t at the runway yet.” Line more questioning the timing of the wing sweep for takeoff vs the actual sweep itself.>>><<<He understands what the functional reason for extending the wings is. He's asking why Maverick is doing it while pointed at a bunch of obstacles that will probably kill them if they attempt a takeoff.>>><<<I thought that movie did a disservice to every pilot that wasn't Maverick.

In the original, they made it clear that every pilot in the program was exceptionally good and that the competition was extremely close. Then in the second one, everyone is just a punching bag for Maverick to appear like a God.>>><<<I think the point is that Maverick is only the "best" when he breaks the rules, like the first film he took out Viper only when he broke the altitude deck. In the second film he designed the mission by "breaking" the rules the other pilots were taught to fly around, i.e. beyond the safe limits of the plane. Just as it starts with him breaking the rules with the darkstar. I do agree, the other pilots were made to seem kinda lackluster anyway.>>><<<To be fair, Rooster never flew the F-14 or any other variable-geometry aircraft. It wasn't all that long ago that I myself learned that the F-14s swing-wing was automatic and not something that was controlled by the pilot.

That being said, yeah, the line was put there just to draw the viewer to the swing-wing in the first place (and for a bit of Top Gun 1.0 nostalgia).>>><<<Too be Faaaaaaair r/UnexpectedLetterKenny>>><<<Letterkenny is fucking awesome.

And if the sensor goes bad and the plane stops accepting pitch inputs that are necessary to avoid a crash after V1...?>>><<<Probably a WOW switch function>>><<<There's logic that will ignore a faulty WOW switch. There are reduant switches as well. The true tragedy of MCAS was not just that they kept it out of literature to avoid retraining, but they only used a single AOA sensor and did not have any logic to disable the system if that sensor failed. Worse, if the data was faulty it wasn't seen as faulty because it wasn't compared to other flight parameter data. It never should have made it on the airplane in that condition, it violates both Boeing Policy and FAA guidelines for automated systems and safety of flight. It now uses two AOA sensors and compares that data to other expected parameters. If anything doesn't jive, it automatically disables autopilot which disables MCAS. Which was what pilots were supposed to do since failure of the "ghost" MCAS presented as runaway trim.>>><<<That's why sensors are redundant (and usually double-redundant — one sensor per pilot, plus a standby sensor on one side) and undergo regular maintenance. There are also cases where protections may be either automatically inhibited (or easier to override) during some phases of flight, or where a failed sensor can be detected and its inputs discarded, at the cost of that protection being in place (though as far as I know this is always very clearly communicated to the pilots).

That last case happened with [Birgenair 301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birgenair_Flight_301) in 1996: during a 20-day stay in the Dominican, wasps are thought to have obstructed one of the pitot tubes before the incident flight. The pilots failed to diagnose the issue before flying into the sea despite clear warnings about instrument disagreements, and lessons from that report have been integrated into pilot training since.

Incidents like the 737 MAX MCAS issues were the result of poor design, sure, but they were a compound issue.>>><<<&gt; That's why sensors are redundant

Boeing: "Wait, what?">>><<<Lol. The whole reason people are talking about single sensors is because Boeing royally screwed the pooch with MCAS.>>><<<Sensors absolutely should and usually are redundant. But MCAS is still very fresh in peoples minds. Boeing needs to re-earn our trust. In this case, they need to lay out every detail of the design of something like this, so more than just their eyes are on it and any deficiencies can be brought to the forefront. No more designing in the dark like they did on the MAX.>>><<<I imagine that systems like MCAS will be receiving a lot more scrutiny from aviation regulators and certification bodies in the future. Hopefully, the re-testing the MAX had to undergo before returning to service will serve as a baseline.

I don't expect the design of these systems to be made public at any point.>>><<<Tail Strike Avoidance Augmentation System. Fed by a single ultrasonic distance sensor. Pushes the nose down if it determines a tail Strike is imminent. No simulator training needed.

/s of course.>>><<<It’s so automatic that no one even doesn’t have to know about it!>>><<<Except the crash investigators.>>><<<&gt;Fed by a single ultrasonic distance sensor.

No, they deleted that in the final design so it's part of the MCAS system's reliance on a single AOA vane along with the coffeepot and the aft lav flush system.>>><<<Optical sensor facing the coffee pot - I like it!>>><<<That's how a -300 behaves like a -200. No training needed to take into account that it's 10m longer!>>><<<The TSAAS would never randomly trigger nose down in normal flight and kill hundreds of people now would it>>><<<Ahh, the mysterious TSAAS system.>>><<<MCAS had it all wrong.

I am sure they have thought of that though>>><<<I assume that the brunt of the weight comes from the structure where its mounted. It doesn't help having a tail strike device if it just gets pushed into the main structure>>><<<I think most of the skidblok itself is sacrificial and therefore quite heavy>>><<<Just the end was. The heavy part is the mounting hardware and the hydraulics used to extend it.>>><<<&gt; removing the physical tailskid saves over 100kgs of weight.

This is the weight of one extra fat person in row 45.>>><<<There is a lil yellow fin where the tail skid used to be, and there are two wires in the fin that send inputs to prox sensor electronic units when an open or short is sensed by the pseu's. So it's not like its any better now. You just scrape through the fin and the wires and a short or open occurs and sends signals to the flight deck through the AIMS system. I would rather have that bumper.>>><<<Well in theory you don't need a bumper with electronic TSP, but if you do hit its good to know!>>><<<Recent Airbus have one also. It can be surpassed if needed.>>><<<I think you mean *bypassed*>>><<<Maybe.

In this case, it would be better to say it *exceeded* the capabilities.>>><<<If my memory is correct, Concorde has a little wheel instead of a skid.>>><<<Correct.

Could imagine only the 737 having them as it is lower than the a320 family>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I know next to nothing about airplanes, so maybe this is entirely obvious, but what do you mean by "they're not geometrically limited on rtation"? Like, there's something else that doens't allow them to rotate that much? Stall speed, perhaps?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Hmm okay, that explains it a bit but I don't think I fully get it yet. For the shorter aircraft, you have the same situation at a lower speed as for the longer aircraft at the higher speed, right? Or is there some other consideration that determines the minimum speed there, like just the minimum speed to generate enough lift to remain airborne (not climbing but just not falling either)?

And to check when that last thing is true, if I understand things correctly: with the shorter aircraft, you can immediately rotate to your take off angle because your tail won't hit the ground and you can start getting off the ground; but for the longer aircraft, you have to accelerate a bit more so that you can take off with a lower angle because you're now going faster and thus produce more lift for the same angle, i.e. you need a lower angle to get off the ground. Is that correct?>>><<<A plane that is geometrically limited will lift the nose and still accelerate on the ground until the wing generates enough lift at that angle of attack to get the plane off the ground. Which may only be a few seconds later. 

A plane that is not geometrically limited will take off before a tail strike can happen. 

So your second point is correct.>>><<<And how about the first part? What determines the minimum speed at which you can start to rotate?>>><<<The lift generated by the wing and the weight of the plane. A wing will generate a certain amount of lift depending on speed. The faster the plane goes the more lift the wing generates. 

A big plane may weigh more but it may still have the same take off speed as a small plane due to how the wing is designed on the plane>>><<<The tail skids show up on long stretched models. The first 737's were tiny, short, and a little plump looking....>>><<<That's what she said.>>><<<Nope...777-300ERs have them but not the newer ones, the older ones had it. 200LRs never had them. Probably have an electronic tail strike system now.>>><<<I think the 200 was short enough that a tail strike was very unlikely in normal operation.>>><<<Aside from some models on 737, I recall those Boeings have tail skid:

757-300, 767-300/300ER, 767-400, 777-300 (non-ER), and most 777-300ER, except newer builds (I believe) beginning in 2014.>>><<<The longer a320 versions do like a belly rub too>>><<<The 737NG series like -800 &amp; -900 &amp; Max10 all sit very low. 

The ground clearance is low &amp; the fuselage is long. Perfect set up for tail strike on rotation and flare.

The idea being if you smack this thing hard enough to bend the structure it's connected to, that structure was going to need to be replaced with or without this thing.>>><<<It also depends on whether the pressurized vessel would be affected or not which can make things really bad and expensive.

It's only worth doing on certain configurations that are most susceptible to tail strike (fuselage length, wing geometry, gear position, etc.)>>><<<It's not the strike, it's the drag.

Whereas on the 737, it’s mainly toggle switches. A lot more logical in layout too.

I think Boeing got schooled in overhead design with the A320, and it made a big influence to the 777 design.

Still, they’re both better than the MD95... >>><<<Oh I agree there. I was poking a bit of fun that if you don’t really know how to read an overhead panel the 320 and the 737 will look similarly daunting :)>>><<<I flew the MD95 for over two years.

They have to now remember 2 sets of limits and procedures and small differences. But, yes it does benefit the airline.

To answer your second question, there is a strobe light switch at the rightmost which activates the strobe light. There is four buttons right above the switches and are in order: Beacon, Nav, Logo, and Wing.

The buttons do as follows:

* The beacon button controls the beacon light ^(I think) above and below the plane

* The Nav button controls the *Port* and *Starboard* lights which are red and green, respectively

* The Logo button controls the tail light which lights up the horizontal stabiliser (or the tail fin), and

* The Wing button controls the flashing (and steady) wing lights which alerts other planes in the vicinity where the plane is.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I’ve heard it is so that in a case where there is smoke in the cabin and pilots can’t see they can at least feel which button is which>>><<<This is the most correct answer.  

Ex: I use feel while driving my car all the time to adjust the cabin temp, radio... etc.  That way I can keep my eyes on the road.  Those cars with the touch screen interfaces for their radios and climate controls are annoying because all the "buttons" feel the same; so you're forced to actually look down and play around instead of paying attention outside.>>><<<It is so that you can identify them by feel. >>><<<I'm not exactly sure, but I guess it's there to emphasise their importance. Sometimes, other pilots on the ground may not see an aircraft until their landing lights are in view. 

Landing lights are *very* bright, so they can be seen from afar and help to aid the pilots in low visibility or dark conditions.>>><<<&gt;   The Wing button controls the flashing (and steady) wing lights which alerts other planes in the vicinity where the plane is. 

You're thinking of the strobe lights. The Wing button activates lights that illuminate the leading edges of the wings. This is often used to keep tabs on possible icing. The Wing lights are very seldom activated during flight, and are not there to signal other planes.>>><<<Have Volvo design it next time>>><<<Has that new Dreamliner smell.

&amp;#x200B;>>><<<mmm new plane smell ^(and feel)>>><<<A Boeing cockpit that isn't from the 1960s??? We've come a long way... :)>>><<<Can...can I touch it?>>><<<Why did they misspell the word as "DISC"?>>><<<It actually isn't a misspelling; those buttons are there in case the generators fail and need to be disconnected, hence the use of "disc" ^(shortened from disconnect). The "**DRIVE**" light that illuminates is just to tell the pilots that the "driver" of the generator has been disconnected.

The 787 is very redundant, and as you can see, it has *two* generators per engine, so even if it has one generator completely fail, it can still go on pretty much unaffected for the rest of the flight.>>><<< Thanks.  That's the first time in a while I've seen someone _correctly_ spell it "disc".>>><<<L+R and aft ext power? Why so many? 

Also I see the IRS has been simplified from OFF-ALIGN-NAV-ATT to an OFF-ON setting, so ATT mode is automatic? >>><<<The 787 is more electric than other planes and has a starting capacity of 1.45 megawatts. 

It requires so much because more components are electric than other conventional planes (like the 777, where the brakes and air conditioning are using hydraulics and the engine bleed air, respectively).>>><<<So if electrics fails...plane dies?>>><<<Nope! The plane has a lot of redundancies!

Each engine (on the lower right) has two generators, so even if one generator completely *fails* in flight, the other three generators can power the plane for the rest of the flight.

It's like how with 4 engine planes, if one engine fails, the plane can go the rest of the way on the surviving engines.

I read that the engines are electrically more powerful, and can supply two generators instead of one (on the 777 and I think the A350).

Edit: The plane can also use the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) and the battery to provide power to the electric systems. >>><<<Hmm...I mean the 777 also has 2 sets of generators (Primary and backup) and doesn't rely on so mucb electrics. Maybe I'm just an old fart.  

About the IRS, is NAV and ATT mode switching automatic if an ADC fails? I only see an OFF-ON setting. >>><<<I think so, it should do so automatically. I don't know for sure, because I haven't read up on the flight manuals of the 787 yet.>>><<<Dayum. We livin in the future boyes... >>><<<The IRS, it should read ERS. Earth reference systems. It still require time to align.

The pitot and static ADMs( air data module) convert 
pitot and static air pressures to a 
digital signal and send them to the 
FCE (flight control electronics)

Each IRU and AHRU has three ring 
laser gyros and three linear 
accelerometers. Using these and air 
data from the flight control 
electronics (FCE), the ERS calculate: 

 Attitude (pitch, roll and yaw)
• Position (latitude and longitude)
• True heading
• Magnetic heading
• Inertial velocity vectors
• Linear accelerations
• Angular rates
• Track angle
• Wind speed and direction
• Inertial altitude
• Vertical speed
• Ground speed
• Drift angle
• Flight path angle.

The IRUs and AHRUs calculate 
hybrid inertial/GPS data and send it 
to the common data network .

The common data network (CDN) is 
a digital data network that moves 
system information between various 
airplane systems that are connected 
to it.>>><<<This isn't 787 info, but the 747-400/-8F have two APU generators. The plane requires a lot of power to just sit on the ground being loaded or unloaded, so APU GEN 1 powers most of the plane, while APU GEN 2 technically powers the cargo loading systems of the plane. >>><<<Pilots were fussy on the 777, didn't want me posting pictures from the cockpit; any specific reason? I thought if you've seen one in Google images, you've seen it all.
Do layout and equipment very country to country for the 777?>>><<<hmm... it pretty much depends on the pilots, and if you don't have ones that are friendly and allow you to take photos, sorry, you won't have the chance to. I wouldn't think why they would do that, though; cockpits are amazing and so pleasing to see.

Most of the US pilots I have met are quire friendly, so I've got lots of shots of cockpits before,

With your second question, yes, the cockpit options vary from airline to airline. Say, a US airline might want to use pounds, gallons, Fahrenheit, while other airlines might use kilograms, litres and Celsius. It varies from airline to airline.

Edit: typo>>><<<It wasn't so much that I couldn't take picture, I was told not to put them up on social media.

Yeah, mph for Americans and kmh for most of the rest I suppose. That's just labels, you wouldn't have different hardware though, though you might have less depending on budget; maybe leave out the blinkers and carpets?

You'll have a picture of almost all cockpits on the internet, usually given out by the folks who build it.

They also look cooler and more aesthetic for aviation enthusiasts ^(let's face it... the older cockpits are way less pilot and user friendly than now), which makes things look sexier ^(yes, I used that word lol) than what it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.>>><<<So no shit, zombie apocalypse, could a guy with a GED and a give em hell attitude get one of these things flying?>>><<<Not a chance, the amount of system knowledge that is required would be extremely difficult to comprehend without actual aviation knowledge/ flying experience. >>><<<Nice but I’ll still take the bus>>><<<Only one missing is the 787>>><<<Funny story, this picture is almost 14 years old.

Then I realized I am dumb.>>><<<Fun fact, the 135 isn’t a 707. 

It descended from the 367-80 just like the 707 did, but is subtlety different enough (dimensions, control surfaces, etc) that its internal Boeing designation is 717... no relation to the MD bastard of the same name that you see in this photo.>>><<<Also, there was a seperate KC-707 that Israel (and others) purchased.>>><<<Yep. Actually the 707 in the photo is a privately owned refueling tanker (Omega).>>><<<its okay, i thought it was a -135 aswell>>><<<I had no idea the 707 was so big, awesome to see it relative to the others. Does the perspective here distort it that much or is it really that large a plane?>>><<<The 707-120 and 757-200 are pretty similar in size on paper. Use the taxiway lines to compare wingspans.

The 707, 727, 737, and 757 share the same basic fuselage cross section with the same fuselage diameter.>>><<<You're totally right that the 727, 737,and 757 all can trace their lineage back to the 707, but to be pedantic, all they share is the upper lobe of the fuselage. They all have a kind of "two semicircles smushed together" fuselage cross section (the 777 was Boeing's first fully round fuselage), and the lower part, under the passenger deck, is pretty different on all of them.

The 757 is by far the most different of the 4, with it's very different nose profile (designed to fit a cockpit almost identical to the 767's to allow a common type rating), and interestingly the lower lobe of the fuselage behind the wing is actually taller than the lower fuselage in front of it.

One curiosity of this common lineage is you can trace the 737MAX's recent problems all the way back to the layout choices made on the 707 (-80, really).  When the 727 was developed from the 707, and the 737 from the 727, there was no good reason to deviate much from the landing gear height first designed in the 50s. That short landing gear, only made to accommodate the low bypass turbofans of the time, is exactly what made the 737 use more and more radical solutions throughout its life to accommodate larger engines, which has concluded with the tragic MCAS problem.>>><<<It wasn’t only that deviating from the lower landing gear height didn’t make sense, it would have made the 737 unusable at a lot of the airports at the time that didn’t have jet bridges or had jet bridges that were too small to accommodate taller aircraft.>>><<<Also manual baggage loading at small airports.>>><<<Probably a trick to the eye from the angle of the camera &amp; lens since 707 have the same sized fuselage as 727 &amp; 737 from what i know.>>><<<I mean, it was big, but most of the distortion is probably coming from the shape of the taxiway intersection>>><<<Single aisle, though, I think?>>><<<&gt; The aircraft wouldn’t take to the skies for months later.

Months later? You mean two years later?>>><<<2 years = 24 months>>><<<Math checks out.>>><<<Thank you reddit!! Once again a  neat airliner pic✈️👀🛫🛫>>><<<And the 720.>>><<<The 720 got weird nomenclature. For the most part it was just a shorter 707; today it would just get a special designation like 707-500 or whatever, but Boeing hadn't really finalized their numbering system for their passenger jets yet. Point being, the 720 really didn't need to be featured separately (just like they didn't show all three generations of 737 that existed at the time).>>><<<Right. 720 was sorta the same idea that went into the 737SP.>>><<<And one too many...the MD95.>>><<<What are you talking about?>>><<<Boeing 717 is what the MD95 was called after the merger.>>><<<717 =  DC9MAX>>><<<I mean if they integrated it into their lineup, then it deserves the spot>>><<<It was as much a Boeing as Concorde was an Airbus. Nothing about it except the stickers was Boeing.>>><<<Similar to the CSeries/A220>>><<<The real 717 was a version of the 707

Boeing had absolutely no input into the design of the MD95, just acquired it and rebranded it in the merger then shut it down. 

C-17 also is Boeing by name alone for the same reasons. though obviously not pictured here>>><<<Where does the MD-90 fit into this whole mix?>>><<<What people know as the 717 today was developed completely by MD as the MD-95, latest kid in the DC-9 family. It is essentially a slightly shorter MD-90 with a modernized cockpit meant to have commonality with the MD-11, and with brand new engines. 

You can still find promotional images of the MD-95 from early in its development but not a single unit built was painted as an MD-95



Boeing Merged with MD a year before the MD-95's first flight, so it was rebranded the 717. Aside from that, Boeing had no input in designing what became the 717. They tried selling it for a bit, but it was competing against the 737 so they stopped selling it, then finished up the order backlog and shut the production line down permanently.>>><<<Here’s the [lineup of all 9](https://i.redd.it/xshj4ygg9rvy.jpg) from the 100th anniversary celebration a while back.>>><<<Also missing the 720>>><<<must've been grounded :P>>><<<Boeings commercial jets and boeings adopted child of a jet>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<717, It's a McDonnell-Douglas design.>>><<<I kind of hate that they ret-conned the name on it into 717.>>><<<For whatever reason, this was the first time Boeing did a photo op of all of their models lined up like that.

&gt;/s>>><<<Isn't 717 is an updated version of DC 9 / MD 80? I am asking seriously.>>><<<MD95 re-badged.>>><<<Thank you.>>><<<Pretty much, and to add some more detail, the broader DC-9 family went through three or four generations depending on how you count it.

There was the original DC-9 family built in the 1960s and 1970s;

The MD-80 family with various upgrades, built in the 1980s and 1990s;

And the MD-90 &amp; B717 with larger, more modern engines. The 717 was originally supposed to be the MD-95, generally as a shrink version of the MD-90 but with slightly different engines and other minor upgrades; one can debate whether they are ultimately the same generation or not. The MD-90 was built 1993-2000 and the 717 was built 1998-2006. Only the B717 got rebranded as a Boeing because the MD-90 production was well underway by the time McDonnell Douglas became a part of Boeing, but the MD-95/B717 had not yet entered service, so Boeing rebranded that one.

The fact that the broader DC-9 family went through so many major name changes while the 737 family did not is simply a product of how their builders marketed their planes, with McDonnell Douglas renaming it each time while Boeing kept using the same number even though we are now on the 4th generation of 737. But essentially, the DC-9, MD-80, MD-90, and 717 are all just variants of the same plane.>>><<<Each line still uses the original Type Cert, too.  For this reason, I still call the 717 a DC-9.>>><<<I agree. It is interesting how the name changes made the flying public treat each version as a separate plane. It was notable at Delta over the past 10 years when they retired the DC-9, then the MD-80 &amp; MD-90; however, it was barely noted when they retired the 737-200 and 737-300 since they already had the 737-800. But if you ask me, the DC-9 era at Delta won't truly end until they retire the 717.>>><<<Thank you.👍>>><<<Yes>>><<<Thank you.>>><<<Here are some photos that also include the 787 from the 2016 100th Anniversary lineup:

Additionally, the 747 is being retired in 2022 and all remaining production is for the cargo variant. The 787 was introduced after this picture was taken and is also still in production.

I had the pleasure of seeing one of the 747 Air Force One jets take off from a (relatively) close distance. The thing that struck me was how oddly quiet it was compared to much smaller jets that took off earlier and later that day.>>><<<Short answer: yes

Detailed answer:

The different versions have different engine types

707-120 and -320 hadPratt and Whitney JT3C turbojets

707-220 Pratt and Whitney JT4A turbojets

707-420 had Rolls Royce Conway turbofans

707-120B, 320B and 320C had Pratt and Whitney JT3D turbofans

Some military versions (and the unsold civil 707-720) have CFM56 high bypass turbofans.

And there's a very few other re-engined out there with Pratt and Whitney JT8D turbofans.>>><<<When you realize it’s a real picture!

Your big brother is the one born first whether he's bigger than you or not.

One thing I see that I find pretty interesting is that notwithstanding that these are two airplanes of very different sizes, equal bank angles seem to produce equal turn rates.  How they do that?
>>><<<Turn rate is a factor of speed and bank angle, not size. Since the two are traveling at the same speed and banking at the same angle, they turn at the same rate. >>><<<Thanks.  I am actually not certain that's true.  I've a physics education and some flight experience and I thought about if for a long time before I put the comment out there.  The only answer that satisfied me in my own mind is one that depends on both aircraft having the same lift to weight relationship, which in my thinking would be more happenstance than anything else.  If your answer is the end of it, then it would follow that a F-16 and an A380 would turn at the same rate so long as they set up in the same bank angle at the same speed.  Would they?  I don't know, and now I'd like to hear from someone with aircraft engineering expertise to settle the question.>>><<<Good thing I'm an aerospace engineering student! As it happens, they would. >>><<<Can you direct me to some reference which supports that conclusion?  Or explain why it's true?  It is highly counter-intuitive to me.>>><<<See the PHAK, page 5-22 and 5-23. The short version is that a turn is caused by in imbalanced horizontal force. This horizontal force is the horizontal component of lift. 

Imagine, for a moment, you're actually spinning the airplane on a long string. It's constantly turning, and also staying aloft. You can feel it tugging on your hands as it turns, and you know that if you let go, it'll fly away from you. This tugging is the horizontal component of lift that must be provided to turn. In a real airplane, you also need that force. Now, rate and radius of turn of a rotating object are normally impacted by mass as well. However, so is the vertical component of lift (it must equal mass times gravity). By the law of similar triangles, the mass cancels out. By that same logic, the rate and radius of turn are no longer impacted by the mass. That leaves only two variables, the velocity and bank angle. 

Any other questions, feel free to ask. >>><<<I do understand force vector math.  I'll use an extreme example.  What if you decreased the wing surface of an A380 so much that it would provide barely enough lift to get the plane airborne.  In that case, at any given airspeed the lateral force vector produced at any given bank angle would be less than it would be if the wing produced greater lift.  With a lesser lateral force component, how could the modified aircraft turn at the same rate as the unmodified aircraft (assuming same weight and airspeed)?  This is what I do not understand.>>><<<With the wing producing barely the lift needed to get it airborne, even a slight bank would lead to a stall unless you increased the airspeed. The wing generates more lift in a bank since now it has to both turn the airplane and keep it up. 

It might help if you know the equations for both lift and turn rate.
 
* lift = 0.5 (coefficient of lift)(density of air)(airspeed^2 ) (surface area of wing)
* rate of turn = airspeed^2 /(11.26*tan(bank angle)

The rate of turn assumes the wing can provide the lift necessary, be it through a large coefficient of lift (depends on wing design), higher airspeed or larger wings.>>><<<I was waiting for someone to pull out the equation. This is intro to aero level stuff, not quite rocket science.>>><<<I don't see how this establishes that any two aircraft with sufficient wing area to maintain lift through a turn will turn at an equal rate if airspeed and the bank angle of the wings are both equal.>>><<<There's honestly not much else I can say, besides to draw out the free body diagram and see for yourself. >>><<<OK Thanks>>><<<depends on when you woudl claim the aircraft was born.  787-10 program commencement was after 737 max, but discussions and exploratory phase was a couple years before that... just the -8 delays caused it to start much later.

Or if you mean EIS than the -10 still isn't born.>>><<<wait nvm, just realized that is a max -9... it is the little brother in all regards I believe.>>><<<Well, I mean, the 737 has been around a lot longer than the 787...>>><<<That was my thinking.>>><<<Then*>>><<<I can imagine David Attenborough narrating this, something like "the child stays close the parent, as he is an easy target for predators"
>>><<<So would the predator be an A380? >>><<<A380's are filter feeders, feeding off of huge amounts of small economy passengers. A single A380 can consume up to 800 economy passengers in a single feeding.

The 787 is protecting the young 737's from being preyed upon by 777's, which will eat pretty much anything.

Occasionally you'll see a lone 737 or even a 757 taken down by a flock of A320F aircraft, but since they're pretty much impossible to get parts for, they tend to cannabalize one another as opposed to going after isolated boeing aircraft.>>><<<Say more things >>><<<777s adapted this omnivorous lifestyle in response to the dramatic decrease in the population of their favourite prey: the A340.>>><<<But every once in a while, the A340 still gets a moment to laugh in the 777s face when it can do something the 777 can't (like fly non-stop from SXM-CDG).  >>><<<Why cant the 777 fly that route non-stop?>>><<<It probably can if the winds happen to be right to take off over the water.  But taking off the other direction (far more common), there's a big-ass mountain right off the end of the not-very-long (just over 7500 ft) runway.  

So a lot of planes don't have the engine-out performance to take off with a full load of passengers and enough fuel for a transatlantic crossing.  

AFAIK, Air France is the only airline to fly from SXM to Europe without making a stop somewhere nearby to pick up more fuel (on an island with a longer runway and no mountain).  They've only done it with the A340-300.  

747s (classics and -400s) as well as 777s from various carriers all make a stop on the way back as they can't manage the trip non-stop (they can all get from Europe to SXM non-stop though).  >>><<<For some reason I never considered the airport itself. I was stuck thinking why a 777 couldn't make a 6700km flight. Thanks for explaining that.

What's could Air France's plan be for when their current A340's retire? Will they have to stop with non-stop flights?>>><<<&gt; What's could Air France's plan be for when their current A340's retire? Will they have to stop with non-stop flights?

Quite possibly.  Being that nobody else offers an SXM - Europe non-stop, it's not a huge issue to stop on another island for fuel on the way out.  >>><<<Definitely lends credence to calling the Airbus transport the Beluga (XL) when you imagine them as a whale eating a whole pile of plankton...

737 has split winglets - that's a thoughtful design feature incorporated to ultimately reduce induced drag on maneuver conditions. Fwik it has nothing to do with airport sizing constraints but I could be wrong. Gorgeous jet though

737NG has a wingspan of 117' 5" in with winglets

737 MAX has a wingspan of 117' 10" with its split winglets

118' is pretty much the limit before you have to find a bigger gate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX#Aerodynamic_improvements

Seems to be sourced reliably from Aviation Week:

http://aviationweek.com/awin/laminar-flow-boosts-737-max-long-range-performance

&gt;The configuration is designed to maximize lift for a wingspan restricted to the same Category C-sized gates as current 737s. The design traces its origins to the split wingtip adopted for similar gate restraint reasons for the proposed, but never built, MD-12 twin-deck concept devised by McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s before it merged with Boeing. “The span considerations of the MD-12 determined that it had to live within the 213-foot span of the 747-400,” says Boeing Flight Sciences' chief aerodynamicist and former Douglas designer, Robert Gregg. Inboard of the winglet and outboard of the aileron, the MAX will also incorporate a divergent trailing edge. “This puts more load into winglet and makes it work harder,” he adds.>>><<<That sounds more like it wasn't to fit the aircraft in the gate, but more so just make the aircraft perform better with a shorter than maybe ideal wingspan. It says that it was already restricted to those gates, they knew what they had to work with, no?>>><<<Well we read the same thing. I don't agree but I don't know enough to disagree with you either.>>><<<Aero engineer here. The 737 has been around since the late 60's and is widely used around the world, so a ton of airport infrastructure has been designed to accomodate planes of that size.

The goal of the 737 NG and MAX programs were to improve upon the aerodynamics and performance of that proven design -  so it wasn't a question of "how do we make this plane fit into a C-size gate", it was "what's the best way to improve the efficiency of this wing without significantly increasing its span".
 
Long, slender raked tips like the 787 would be ideal, but since they were constrained by gate size they went with the split scimitar tips.>>><<<**Boeing 737 MAX: Aerodynamic improvements**

The split tip wingtip device is designed to maximize lift while staying in the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code letter C gates as current 737s. It traces its design to the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 1990s twin-deck concept, proposed for similar gate restrictions before the Boeing merger. It should deliver at least 1. 5% improvements in fuel economy or even more if the proposed laminar flow surface treatment meets expectations.

Here we see the curious interaction between a 787 and 747-400. Like two ships passing in the night, the 747 is much to large for the 787 to think about taking on its own, however the 747-400's have never been known to go after other aircraft at all, instead preferring to subsist on a large number of small passengers, or medium size cargo.*>>><<<So a little bit of info on the apparent size of the jets here... because it's a telephoto lens it *flattens* the image in a way that makes objects thousands of feet away from each other relatively to scale with each other. So in this picture the 747 is potentially a mile away on an adjacent runway but appears huge in comparison. In reality it's only slightly smaller than it would appear if they were right next to each other. 

For shots like these the windows and doors are a good guide. Although the 787 has slightly bigger windows most jets are nearly similar sizes with their windows and doors. Here the you can see the 747's doors are nearly the same size so this is close to what the planes would look like next to each other to the human eye.

Also to keep in mind is the angle of the jets, the 787 is at a significantly sharper angle away from the camera's Z-axis which diminishes it's apparent size.>>><<<This is SFO, those runways are right next to each other.>>><<<Maybe. Depends on which SFO runways. Considering how high up the '47 is probably not.>>><<<This is shot from Bayfront Park ([confirmed from Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pointnshoot/16249849822)), which would make this a photo of the 747 landing on 28L or R and the 787 taxiing on Foxtrot. From this angle, the 787 is probably about 1.0 miles from the camera and the 747 is either ~1.1 miles or ~1.4 miles from the camera.

"Hey GE, you know those engines you're having trouble supplying us? Yeah, we want a new one.">>><<<Hahahahha>>><<<Noob question, but why was the A380 largely a commercial failure given its size and failed hub-and-spoke model, but this big boy a success? Is there a magic sweat spot? Not requiering specific changes at airports?>>><<<One important difference is that the 777X is a twinjet that consumes much less fuel than the quadjet A380.>>><<<This is based on a limited understanding, but is it correct to generalize that a larger radius jet engine is more fuel efficient than two smaller ones making the same combined thrust?>>><<<Yep. It's all about the bypass air.>>><<<I've never really been able to get my head around this.  I know it's true, but I can't intuitively understand why.

A jet engine pulls in air, compresses it (in multiple stages), then adds fuel and ignites it, which creates an explosion, forcing rotation of the engine core, which keeps the engine spinning and the cabin pressurised.  It then throws that exhaust out the back through a "propelling nozzle" that creates the thrust  - without the nozzle, all you have is a gas turbine generator.

But then if you oversize the outer fan blades, and put a shroud around that, you end up sucking air around the outside of the turbine (bypassing it), which then gets thrown out the back, also providing thrust.

What I get hung up on is that thrust is the reactive force to throwing mass in a direction - if you throw a ball, there's a (small) reactive force that pushes you in the opposite direction.  Or if you throw a ton of air out the back of a jet engine, there's an opposing and equal force acting on the engine to propel it forward.

*But* the thrust coming from the engine core has more pressure, temperature, and I would think velocity, than air that has just gone through a literal fan, and hasn't been ignited or compressed.

So how does a high bypass engine improve efficiency.. What am I missing ?>>><<<Ignore the cowling for a second and what do you have? An enormous propeller. A bigger propeller moves more air at a given rotational rate than a smaller propeller, so for the same fuel burn, you move more air. GE and others are looking at just such a concept (called a propfan) because they’re very efficient: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propfan

That the compressor generates thrust is cool because you get to add it to the thrust being produced by the fan blades, but the bigger-fan-equals-greater-air-movement would be true even for an electrically-powered fan.

So you want the biggest fan you can get under the wings, because if I’m already doing the combustion, I might as well move as much air with it as I can, since I can get more thrust for the equivalent fuel burn. It’s not “free” thrust because you get mechanical losses and drag penalties and such, but it’s far more efficient than just using all that additional air to burn fuel.

e: grammar>>><<<Got it.. thanks.. but this begs the question of why the original jet engines had no bypass.>>><<<Complexity. They were struggling to make the basic concept of jet engines working consistently and reliably in the early days, without throwing in the additional design considerations for bypass. 

Once the turbojet design matured enough, then engineers began to look at ways to improve efficiency, which resulted in bypass of the turbofan.>>><<<Isn't the materials science that goes into the blades within the engine just bonkers? [https://www.wenzelamerica.com/turbine-blades-and-superalloys/](https://www.wenzelamerica.com/turbine-blades-and-superalloys/)

Like without these innovations we'd be stuck back in the smokey jet engines of the early days.>>><<<If you were to make the whole engine shroud a compressor then you would also drastically Increase the weight and fuel consumption of the engine, but wouldn't really increase the rpm of the engine (which is determined by the exhaust gasses driving a fan at the exit of the engine, which in turn drives the shaft of the engine). 

Since you have this shaft at a given rpm, you might as well try to move some extra air by adding extra fan blades, as there is only a minor drag/torque penalty for doing so. So for the same amount of fuel burnt, you now can move WAY more air, and this have a more efficient engine>>><<<Mass. They bypass move a larger amount of air mass. Your conceptual understanding relies on thinking that more pressure and speed will produce more thrust but that's only true when comparing the same area. The bypass has a much larger area than the core and moves much more air mass.>>><<<Okay, right. but why wouldn't you just make the engine bigger.. and send all of that air through the core ?.. What's the advantage of only using some of the air to spin the engine ?>>><<<The core is not efficient but produces lots of excess torque. Using the torque to drive the bypass converts the fuel energy into thrust without letting the excess torque go to waste.>>><<<That's an interesting way to look at it, thanks.>>><<<It's less efficient to produce thrust by ducting air through the core engine compared to bypassing air around it.  
  
There are many reasons to not make an engine bigger, a few big ones being: you run into problems with ground clearance, it's more difficult and expensive to produce, and there's an inherent limit in how big an engine can get. As fan size increases, so does the blade tip speed, and if the blade tip speed starts approaching the supersonic region all kinds of shit starts to happen.>>><<<It is better to exhaust a lot of air mass with a slight velocity increase, than a small amount of air mass with a high velocity increase. Both might lead to the same thrust force, but in the latter case, you have a lot of kinetic energy in the exhaust air which is a complete waste. It is related to the fact, that the kinetic energy of the exhaust air is proportional to mv², while the thrust is only proportional to mv.>>><<<The limited way I think about it is that the pure turbojets used to have a ton of excess noise and heat. Driving the bypass fan is a way to push that energy I to momentum>>><<<Fuel and also simple economics. The engine core is much more complex with its multiple compressor stages and complicated cooling systems. scaling all that up means much more expensive engines. You also need fuel to turn that much bigger engine core and also to have stable combustion as you can't just run everything super lean.

In essence large Bypass engines are almost turboprops just with a cowling around it.>>><<<Force is from change of momentum (F=ma=m(Δv)/t),  to get that Δv, you use energy as per kinetic energy: 1/2 m(Δv)^2.   So as the Δv goes higher, more energy is required per thrust: E/F ∝ Δv, so efficiency is 1/Δv       
I.e. it's more efficient to do less acceleration on more air.  This is only limited by physical constraints and the extra weight cost of larger fans.>>><<<The amount of air being moved by the high bypass fan is astounding.  The thrust from the gas turbine is used to drive the fan in an axial configuration.   A non-axial configuration like a turbo prop plane or a turbine helicopter use the thrust from the turbine to drive another fan connected to an output shaft that drives the propeller.>>><<<Huh.. I had never thought of the rotor blades of a helicopter as being like a very high bypass engine without a cowling.... but now I see the usefulness in logically separating the fan function from the engine function, even when (like in a plane) both are mounted on the same shaft>>><<<Their explanations are okay, but to focus on the physics: Yes, bypass ratio is important, but you can have the same ratio in different engine sizes. The reason larger diameter fans are still more efficient is because of drag. Drag is pcAv^2 so 2x speed is 4x drag. A larger fan can push the same amount of air at a slower rpm, which has exponential consequences on drag. 

It has more surface area for engine cooling, and the fan air is further from
the hot core. Colder fan air is more dense, which means more mass, which means more thrust.

There's also an engine weight difference, efficiency in use of the materials, that I'm too lazy to get into. As you increase engine size, less material per horsepower is needed. Certainly a lower part count than doubling number of engines instead. But basically all the answers go back to the basic geometry of the engine. Diameter, volume, surface area, fan speed, bypass ratio.>>><<<A lot of people have given you good answers but to try to understand it intuitively I think that for a second we should forget how the engine works and just think about the thermodynamics of it because in a way you are actually thinking about it backwards. Imagine for a second that the engine is just a black box that burns fuel and exhausts air. 

If you burn an amount of fuel and then exhaust hot, high-pressure gas out the back of our engine, you are throwing overboard a lot of potentially useful energy that has not been converted into forward motion. In fact the ideal would be to exhaust gas that is at ambient temperature and pressure - then you would have extracted all usable energy from the fuel you burned.

Pressure is fairly easy to deal with - it's really just a function of the geometry of your exhaust nozzle. In most high-performance turbojets and rocket engines, exhaust pressure is designed to be around ambient pressure at the cruising altitude. You can tell this by observing the [Mach diamonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_diamond) that form when they are run near sea level - even from a very powerful engine, the exhaust is actually being squeezed down by the atmosphere because its static pressure is less than one atmosphere at the point of exit.

But if the exhaust gas is still hotter than ambient temperature you are again wasting energy. So one way to think about a high-bypass turbofan is that it is actually a way to decrease the average temperature of your exhaust gas, which makes you more efficient.>>><<<The jet engine makes plenty more power than it needs to keep spinning so you can attach more blades to it and push more air, while simultaneously helping keep the core cooler, so it can make even more power. I remember reading once that jet engines are limited on efficiency by the materials they're made of. If we could make something strong and heat resistant enough, we could make some really amazing thrust and efficiency. But we can't, so bypass air is the next best thing.

But there's a lot more to it than what I just said.>>><<<In general bigger engines are more efficient then smaller engines. You’ll see the same in everything from cargo ships to power generation.>>><<<Think of the bypass fan portion of a turbofan as a big propeller and the rest of the turbine hot core part as mostly just an engine that turns the propeller. Fan area increases exponentially as diameter increases, but the fuel burn required to turn the bigger fan is not, thus a bigger bypass fan is more efficient than a smaller one for a given amount of fuel used.>>><<<Ahhh okay, yes.. so in terms of fuel per unit of thrust, it's more efficient to drive a big fan.

But there must be a limit on how big your fan can be.. current designs already have supersonic blade tips, so if you went even bigger, that would become limiting, perhaps ?>>><<<That's why engine manufacturers are now developing turbofans with reduction gears between the fan and the core.>>><<<Plus half the maintenance for engines , which I think would cost a lot, given the complexity>>><<<The A380 is a much larger plane really. Its slightly shorter, but its heavier, has a larger wingspan, and is taller. Max passengers on this is 414, vs a theoretical max of 853 for the A380. That means there are actually relatively few airports the A380 can use (its a code f vs e for the 777x). That limits routes and therefore flexibility. The airports and gates the A380 can use are also more expensive. 

The main issue though is fuel efficiency. The 4 engine design of the A380 dates from pre-2000 fuel prices where this wasn't a huge issue, in the current climate the A380 is very expensive to run and needs to be basically full all the time to turn a profit. This means only a few routes like London to Dubai are worthwhile as finding 800 passengers for other routes isn't guaranteed. The 777x has more efficient engines and the 2 engine design is naturally more efficient, less maintance intensive and doesn't have disadvantages for safety.

All in the A380 is just too niche, this plan will be more versatile. Shame though, the A380 is the most comfortable plane I've ever flown on.>>><<<Very informative comment so thank you but it still made me kinda sad. I’m weirdly obsessed w the A380 after flying 8 times every year (DXB to LAX) and knowing that they’ll change it to this plane is kinda sad for me. A380s are hella fun and comfortable but I guess not profitable. Wonder what emirates will do with their 100+ A380s>>><<<What’s your frequent flyer status? Do they just hand you gold bullion?>>><<<I’m platinum now. Been flying that route a lot>>><<<I remember United's highest miles customer got his name painted on a 747>>><<<Scrapped, I doubt they get turned to freighters. I don’t think the efficiency is good enough to make sense.>>><<<It's unlikely the a380 will ever be cargo due to the 2nd floor being structural, so it can't take big loads (tee-hee).

Some airline are doubling down on them through, i think i remember Singapore looking for some more, due to limited amount of slots, so would fly 1 plane daily rather than 2 smaller aircraft on some routes.>>><<<Yes. It’s yet unclear that Emirates is replacing the a380 with the 777x… more likely they’re replacing their older 777s. Emirates would buy more a380s if they could.>>><<<Emirates only would have bought more had Airbus updated the A380 to a new version. Airbus was unwilling to do that because Emirates was literally the only airline interested in it and they wouldn’t have recouped their investment.>>><<<Correct.>>><<<The 4 engines also stem from the time when ETOPS was limited to 3 hours which meant a lot of the transpacific and even transatlantic routes were off limits to twin engine aircraft.  
Big advances in engine tech and regulation relaxation to allow 7 hours diversion times has helped open up the routes so now it’s limiting (or removing!) the need of the 4 engine set up>>><<<That.. is not entirely accurate. The 350 1000 regularly goes with 240 mins of EDTO and the 777 300ER regularly flies now with just 204 mins. In fact, pretty much everywhere can be done with just those EDTO requirements. There is nowhere in the world where 7 hours is the distance to the closest usable alternate that I can think of. I would guess (and not a slight meant in any way) that you don't do this for a living? Just guessing, because it hasn't been called ETOPS for a few years. 180 ETOPS (when it was called that) was more than enough for trans pacific and polar routes, fyi.>>><<<“In production” being the headline’s operative caveat. I first thought of the A380 too. The big Airbus was basically an improvement of a late 60s concept. I suppose it a mix of bad luck, national pride, and institutional inertia that made Airbus sink billions into a concept whose time had passed.>>><<<It's just too massive for almost all airlines. I'd say only Emirates has truly been able to harness it. But even they are now looking ahead to replacing it with efficient heavy twins.

1.) It's inefficient compared to the newgen twins\
2.) It's heavy and only certain airports can handle it\
3.) It has 4 engines to take care of. Emirates has 119 A380s. That's 476 engines.\
4.) It's an inefficient cargo hauler due to its weight and unlike the 747 which has nose cargo door the 380 cannot match that loading efficiency. It's just too heavy. There's some intersting physics involved here, see below.

The end customer, being Fedex, is probably starting to install the wiring harnesses now, almost 3 years later. Many of the delays were paperwork delays. There is so much red tape in aviation it's insane.  During the project we found many issues with Honeywells engineering drawings and it can take months for Honeywell to approve engineering changes. 

Now imagine this scaled up to the project size of an entire airplane.>>><<<Make sure plane fly good, no crashy crashy like brother Max>>><<<The FAA has revised their flight certification process and has made it really extensive and exhaustive.

The FAA is currently overhauling their aircraft certification process. This means to certify a new plane, it now takes a lot more than it previously did. Aircraft certified before this new timeline (787-10, 737-9, E190-E2, A350-1000) have all had relatively quick certification times, but aircraft certified after this time (777-9, 737-7/-10, E175-E2, A350F) will be subject to these new, harsher regulations and thus take a lot longer to certify. You can expect delays for any new aircraft entering service in the next five years thanks to this new overhaul by the FAA. While of course, the embarrassment of the US’ own Boeing having some quality control and PR issues has really antagonised the FAA, the truth is that regulators frequently update aircraft certification requirements to ensure that new-built aircraft are safer than the previous generation. I’d expect EASA and many other regulators to follow the FAA over the next few years with their own certification requirement updates, based on the FAA’s new overhaul. 😊>>><<<The catalyst for this major overhaul was the issues with the Max though, so they are correct. And I don’t think they were making fun of a fatal crash, we don’t always have to discuss things with complete reverance just to make a point.

Boeing cut corners, put money ahead of safety, lied to the pilots, lied to the regulators, lied to the passengers and the families of those who died. I personally consider what the FAA is doing too light because they should specifically do more to ensure that Boeing isn’t killing people for profits… again.>>><<<What's the big, red, emergency stop button for at 1:20?

Clearly MCAS was the rare exception, the one oversight that threaded the multiple layers of swiss cheese safety evaluations.  

&gt; Boeing has to develop and implement a fix anyways

All it took for Boeing to finally implemented the fix was **346 human lives** across 2 flights and almost 2 years of grounding by the FAA. 

Heck I'm not even sure if boeing admitted that MCAS having that much trim control being controlled by a single AoA sensor was a safe design allowed to fly. 

but hey hindsight 20/20, maybe i should stop being an ass at the money pinching bean counters execs whose profit over safety culture led to this *unforeseeable incident*, they clearly deserved their bonuses and golden parachutes. 

346 lives is after all a small price to pay for a piss poor attempt to maintain type rating across a almost 60 year old air frame.



All that said, the folding wingtips on the 777x is probably a no biggie even if it malfunctioned in flight. Given how much boeing is being scrutinised on safety now. I just hope boeing doesn't prove us wrong with more incidents,

Normally, looking at them from the ground, contrails look quite thin, but from this angle, nearly head on, it's clear that the contrail is actually much larger than it appears from the ground.>>><<<Technically most of the water vapor is from the high-humidity air the plane is flying through. The engine exhaust is putting out CCNs (particles that the water vapor can condense on - basically soot) which is causing most of the cloud being formed.  Yes,  there is some water vapor in the exhaust but that’s not the majority of the cloud.>>><<<Ahh, thanks. It's obvious that contrail formation has to depend on the atmospheric conditions in some way, as not all flights produce contrails. I figured humidity was part of that, but I never quite connected all the dots. Thanks for clearing that up!>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<In this case there isn't any condensation from the wingtips. Sometimes you do get condensation there when landing in very humid weather. This is from very low pressure at the center of the wingtip vortices (the air whirls like a tornado at the wing tip).>>><<<The comment might also be referring to how after the contrails are created, they are subsequently blown around and twisted by the wingtip vortices created by the wings. 

Good video on wing tip vortices and winglets from Mentour Pilot:
https://youtu.be/2ieRwRnwqY8>>><<<Cool, thanks!>>><<<In addition to what the first reply said, the shape of the contrails is due to vortex shedding, an aerodynamic effect off the wings.  It's the twisting up and to the middle of the condensation.>>><<<u mean chemtrails? with which the goverment controls our minds?

It traps heat from escaping into space, but doesn't reflect enough sunlight to offset the amount of trapped heat. 

"The balance between Earth’s incoming sunlight and outgoing heat drives climate change. Contrails trap energy coming off the earth and atmosphere below that would otherwise find its way to space. Persisting contrails can spread into extensive cirrus clouds that tend to warm Earth, because they reflect less sunlight than the amount of heat they trap."

First of all, the volume that plane is spitting out (if it had chemtrails) is insane. It would drastically shorten the range to hold enough to do this constantly. On top of that, the altitude, judging by the ground, is high enough that the cold air coming in contact with the very hot engine exhaust would make steam. Don’t believe me?

Thanks for helping me out!)>>><<<What building were they in when they took this??>>><<<This is epic>>><<<There never has been a Hull Loss/Crash or any fatalities involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This plane has been around for over 10 years, so that is a pretty good safety record. 

Personally I would much rather fly on a Dreamliner than say a 737 Max>>><<<100k+ miles/year here. the dreamliner is hands down my fav long haul equipment. from the lighting to cabin pressure tech to noise levels to the dimmable windows to the space available (obvs depending on carrier and class, but in general there's a lot of room on that thing) to cabin layout (dito), it's a great plane to spend 10+ hours in.

i rmember my first flight in it and noticing that even the cabin crew really enjoyed the environment. 

enjoy japan!>>><<<It is one of the quietest plane so far. The windows can be dimmed individually. Cabin pressure is at 6000ft so it help with jetlag a lot.

Flown on both 787-9 and -10 and TBH they are great planes.>>><<<Should I be worried! I keep seeing it in the news and really nervous to fly as a passenger>>><<<Nah. The media just love clicks.>>><<<Hope so lol>>><<<I've flown over the Pacific to/from Tokyo in a 787 about 14 times without any issues at all.  It's by far my favorite plane out of all the widebody planes I've flown in, which includes 747s, 767s and 777s.  It's a wonderful experience and as safe as you can get.  One recent fight from Tokyo to LA had some pretty bad turbulence for several hours but the plane handled it very well and after researching more after returning home I realized the plane could have handled much worse.  I love sitting by the wings so I can see their beautiful shape as they flex during takeoff.>>><<<I’ve flown transpacific many times from North America to various Asian destinations. The 787 is by far the best aircraft for long haul flights. The lower noise, smoothness and especially the increased humidity make a tremendous difference in comfort and how you feel at the end of the flight. 

Think about it this way; the Dreamliner is the top-of-the-line airplane for airlines that fly it so the crews are the best and most experienced the airline has. It’s not a puddle-jumper flown by the 1501 hour new guy. 

Enjoy your trip and don’t worry about the flight.

Edit to add - While the 787 is a marvel of modern engineering and my favorite, the ‘electronic dimming windows’ are not that marvelous. I prefer the cheap plastic shade. Lol.>>><<<I was on a Dreamliner a little while ago and sat next to a lady who was afraid of flying. I explained to her how it’s one of the most modern and respected jets out there, and that seemed to help. 

Just FYI, the wings flex on a 787 more than some other aircraft. From what I understand, the flexing is a side effect of the 787’s modern composite materials and relatively wide wingspan. 

Completely normal, but it looks different. I figure if you’re a nervous flyer, it’s better to know this ahead of time. Personally I think it’s really cool!>>><<<My partner is a nervous flyer to. She said she liked the 787 due to its capacious environment. I don't fly long haul much, but when I do .. I would prefer the 787. I'm 6'3 and this thing is comfortable. Good luck bro.>>><<<I did the same by researching planes to get over my fear and anxiety (so I know what to expect) and I think it has helped greatly, hope it does for you!\~ on opposition I love watching planes, the take off, and landing - just not the cruising part>>><<<"If one of those engines fails, how far will the other one take us?"

I tend to be honest unless there is an issue that no one knows about. Those times I just keep it within the crew. No reason to worry people. >>><<<I like the “no reason to worry people” attitude.

Had really bad windshear and dropped from 900 feet to 400 feet all while engines were max thrust.  That being said I don't really think worried is the right word. It was more really focused on not flying the plane into the ground then afterwards was something along the lines of holy fuck. More adrenaline then anything. >>><<<Depends, is there a bingo scheme running on-board?>>><<<I know its stupid, but is it safe to dump fuel to the atmosphere?>>><<<It’s not great, but it immediately evaporates. So long as you do it at a safe altitude (usually ~6000ft+) nobody can tell the difference.

Compared to the environmental damage caused by all the other fossil fuel usage worldwide it’s fine.>>><<<Quick explanation: Planes are required to dump fuel if they have to land shortly after takeoff. Especially on long distance flights the combined weight of passengers, freight+luggage and fuel makes the plane heavier than the maximum landing weight which is normally much lower than the maximum takeoff weight. Normally they burn the fuel and arrive light enough to land. If, due to technical failure etc., they have to land early fuel dumping is necessary.

There are normally designated areas where they are allowed to do that and the fuel doesn‘t reach the ground immediately. Most of it gets broken down by UV light and other environmental influences, the rest gets diluted.

Of course it‘s still very bad for the environment but at least we can be sure that, due to the high cost, airlines are not doing it just for shits and giggles.>>><<<Hydrocarbons are generally close to harmless at low concentrations.  Bacteria consume them very quickly.  The risk is human or animal consumption of high concentrations, or crude oil fouling everything up.  For instance, leaky underground storage tanks are generally just monitored for impact to water sources.  If there's not a risk of contamination, they just let it break down naturally, which occurrs pretty quickly.>>><<<The VOCs do, but the heavier molecular components of hydrocarbons remain and need remediation. Using specialized equipment they can burn it off the soil, create bacteria in a lab to target the area, aerate the soil or a host of other remediation techniques. But leaving an UGST in situ leaking or the result of a leak won't just magically become solved. >>><<<This guy EPA's.>>><<<Is that the use for an air compressor at a contamination site?

My work has one way out in the woods, but apparently we used to do some dumping when we used to use more.. "aggressive" chemicals>>><<<Aerating could use forced air. Aerobic (with oxygen) decomposition is much faster. >>><<<Wich bacteria for example>>><<<Aromatoleum aromaticum>>><<<Dilution is the solution to pollution?>>><<<Some planes aren't capable of dumping and need to fly around and burn off the fuel instead>>><<<They don't *have* to. If a situation warrants an immediate landing, like a medical emergency, or some sort of progressive failure which continued flight risks degrading to a more serious condition, they can land safely overweight. >>><<<Yeah, max landing weight is generally based on 600-700fpm descent rate on touchdown. Basically, a stable approach with no flare.

Provided you flare normally, most aircraft can touchdown safely at max takeoff weight.>>><<<Why not just dump passengers instead? Would be more environmentally friendly.>>><<<Liability issues: passengers don‘t evaporate on their way down. Also hurts return business.>>><<<I just thrilled by seeing the plane dumping a lot of fuel... that triggered my concern about the environment. But to save everyone else's life, I think its okay>>><<<Oh boy, if you're concerned about the environment, then hearing that places like India and China exist is really going to bum you out. >>><<<Or, you know, the US>>><<<Meh not really>>><<<Considering that the US is the second largest producer of CO2 in the world, with emissions per capita twice as high as China and TEN times that of India, yes really.>>><<<The per capita argument isn’t a great measurement in this case. China and India have huge populations of people that produce almost no CO2 emissions. Their populations that do are also huge, but since they have so many people, it gets diluted. A better comparison would be to look at China’s middle and Upper class vs the US. In that case, it’s not even close.>>><<<&gt; A better comparison would be to look at China’s middle and Upper class vs the US. In that case, it’s not even close.

You got any sources for that? Not trying to call you out, I'm just curious.>>><<<You wouldent need a source. He's not stating fact, it's pretty low-level common sense to assume it would be a better comparison.>>><<<https://imgur.com/a/3fNPb90

Atleast the US is doing something about it. Besides C02 emissions you also have, among others, water pollution where China and others are  *far* worse compared to the US. 

Just looking at raw C02 output is not enough.>>><<<Afters decades of environmental destruction, a few steps to feign deliberation isn't enough.

Across the history of the nations, USA is by far the clear leader in destruction of environment by a long long margin.

Also, I'm curious what you'd think about the gulf of Mexico being injected with an unholy amount of oil spill just because the guilty company bought the so called USA "authorities" and "regulators"?

>>><<<What would happen if you dump fuel at say crusing attitude? Still evaporates?>>><<<Higher altitude would mean lower pressure, so yes it would still evaporate.>>><<<If you have some altitude it'll evaporate before hitting the ground. At too low altitude it might cause a stink, but since you're doing it at speed it'll be pretty spread out and just a minor smell of fuel, much like you'd smell around an airport.    Safer anyway than the potential crash/runway excursion of an overweight landing, and having to fly in a replacement plane / repair crew / potentially writing off a plane itsn't exactly environmentally sound either. >>><<<[deleted]>>><<<The difference between a whiff of it like you smell at airports everywhere, vs getting a bucket of the stuff poured over you. Personally I don't mind the smell all that much. >>><<<Well the visuals may seem extreme but that's fuel that would otherwise be burned and released into the atmosphere anyway. Not too sure but I would be surprised if dumping fuel is actually less polluting than burning it and releasing emissions into the atmosphere. >>><<<I'd imagine it would be worse for ground pollution like rivers and lakes vs air pollution>>><<<It atomizes and evaporates before getting to the ground. The plane would need to be at fairly low altitude for liquid fuel to actually hit anything below.>>><<<I believe anything above 5000 feet is fine, It should atomize in 3000 feet. The problem I once heard at JFK was a relatively new pilot got a little antsy with a flame out and started dumping immediately which taking off just off V1. That caused Jet A to be spilled on the ground.>>><<<Exhaust can mix with rain and cause similar effects. It's possible that the optics  of seeing liquid feul dump may just be more emotionaly gripping than seeing it burned>>><<<I've heard fish really like a dash of Jet A1 in their water. Gives it a bit more of a kick.>>><<<If it's over a pasture it's just pre-seasoning the steaks with Jet A1 sauce.>>><<<Well it's safer than not dumping the fuel, crashing, and killing 300 people. >>><<<&gt;I know its stupid, but is it safe to dump fuel to the atmosphere?

Compared to what?>>><<<Just curious, compared to burning the fuel like usual?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<that doesn't answer the question.

What is "This"

And what is the 'problem'?

And what is your solution?>>><<<The issue is, the airplane can't safely land with a full load of fuel.  Extra fuel (which is about 8 lbs/gallon) increases the touchdown speed (to possibly out of safe limits) and stopping distance (perhaps to longer than the available runway).  >>><<<Thanks for the info! I never thought about that kind of details when riding an airplane. I am just a normal passenger haha>>><<<6.7 lbs/gallon is the standardized denisity for jet fuel.  It varies somewhat with temperature and other factors but never reaches 8lbs/gallon; that's the density of water.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it's not just landing speed and distance considerations, but the potential for airframe/landing gear structural overload.>>><<<If you’re doing a carrier landing...   In a big jet, if   you grease it on, then no more stress than was placed on the gear when the plane took off.   Yea, it’s been quite a few years...6.7 is correct. >>><<<No worries.

I'm confused. The blue dotted line is the planned route, yes?>>><<<Airliners are typically cleared to fly a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) when leaving a major airport. The SID takes into account a lot of things, like separating arrival and departure traffic, noise abatement, terrain clearance, etc. SIDs are also different for the different runways at a given airport. In addition, you can be vectored off the SID for a variety of reasons, most commonly severe weather. For all of these reasons, the exact departure path for any given flight is difficult to predict beforehand.

You'll notice that before the turn for the diversion the aircraft was on a heading that would have intercepted its intended route. That's pretty typical. Once you get out of the high traffic area (and clear of weather) you're cleared to re-establish on the intended route, climb to altitude, and be on your way.>>><<<It's hard to really know for this particular situation but it could have been weather or general traffic. ATC also likes to work with pilots and give them shortcuts whenever possible which means maybe they can skip a waypoint or two to make the flight a little quicker.>>><<<But they diverted. That's what this post is. The planned route is all the way from the origin, which I'm guessing is probably either SFO or LAX>>><<<No, I get that the planned route (blue dots) goes to LAX. But \*immediately\* leaving Melbourne, they don't follow the planned route. They are way off course when they start the diversion.>>><<<Wind? Other traffic? It's perfectly normal>>><<<Assuming that the left turn off the east cost of Australia is the point where the flight was diverted, then why didn't they turn back to the mainland?

Was it due to altitude and the required fuel dump time?

They would never vent smoke, that's just adding more oxygen to a fire. What helps aircraft contain fire is the fire is compartmentalized.  The problem is as you are flying,  its almost impossible to figure out where the fire is.

In general, it's more work than 121 airline stuff, since you're probably doing the flightplan, getting notams, possibly making the hotel arrangements, etc. You also load the bags (though, it's not like you have 250 people's worth of bags to load).

Perks? Really depends on the job, like I said. More potential for home basing. More day trips (some operators...others have worse schedules). You don't need an ATP to be right-seat (some). Cooler planes (some). Expenses paid (some).

It's just.....different. 

Overall, 121 has more stability and many would consider it a "better" career path. But some people enjoy and embrace the 135 and 91 life.

Of course, there are some unicorn 91 jobs that pay $300k+ with minimal overnights.>>><<<There will probably be a shortage someday at the regional airlines but there won't be one at high paying majors. >>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I was lazy, and had some medical problems early in my training so I had too many checkride failures.

The crested gecko (Correlophus ciliatus) is a species of gecko native to southern New Caledonia. In 1866, the crested gecko was discovered by a French zoologist named Alphone Guichenot, who is also credited with naming the species. This species was thought extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 during an expedition led by Robert Seipp.  Along with several Rhacodactylus species, it is being considered for protected status by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.

But I do remember hearing about an interesting incident with a new Air Canada 787 a couple years ago.  They were on their way to Asia somewhere before having to declare an emergency and divert to Alaska due to an oil issue.  Supposedly they investigated and found that the malfunctioning part/system left the factory in that condition even though Boeing had signed off on it, suggesting another possibly pencil-whipped inspection.

Aircraft composites are extremely new in engineering terms and poorly understood relative to traditional metals, and much of our ignorance about composites concerns how they will behave in the future, particularly after thousands of pressurization cycles. That isn't something that can be easily modelled. Look at the paint on the Dreamliner wings that flex and then peel - it was apparently completely unforeseen, and there's still no solution for it.

The issues are that we don't know how composites will change over time in their fatigue characteristics, and composites in particular don't fatigue like traditional metals - they don't really bend. They tend to just snap, catastrophically, and short of extremely precise literally atomic scale analyses it's difficult to predict that failure is imminent.

The Titan IMPLODED because composites were being put under compression, the thing composites are terrible at. 

A pressurized fuselage is under positive pressure, meaning the composite material is under TENSION, AKA the thing composites are best at.

Your "pressurization cycles" comment shows a surface-deep understanding of how mechanics of materials works. You're not qualified to be making these comments, just stop.>>><<<Yeah, this guy thinks he's smart, but is completely lacking knowledge. >>><<<the titan submarine failed because they took it to an extreme depth far beyond what their viewing port was rated for. the titan implosion was not “unpredictable” it was inevitable 

it has basically nothing in common with an airplane structure or “warping composite”

the 777 empennage has been flying around with the same composite as the 787 for 30 years and has never caused a hull loss>>><<<The 777 from '30 years ago' does not use anywhere near the same proportion of composites as the Dreamliner does:

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Composite-structure-of-Boeing-787_fig3_317607272#:~:text=The%20figure%20shows%20that%20now,70%25%20aluminum.%20...&amp;text=Context%202-,...,23%20tons%20of%20carbon%20fiber.

"The figure shows that around 50% material used in Boeing 787 is composite material with comparison to the Boeing 777 which used only 12% of composite and 70% aluminum"

I also disagree with your assessment of the Titan. While it should not have been used for those purposes precisely because composites and extreme pressures don't mix because of composite fatigue, as a matter of engineering and design it was (in perfect condition) theoretically safe to descend to that depth and had done so many times. The issue was that testing for composite fatigue is basically impossible and had they been able to do so they likely would not have descended in the first place. Perhaps 50 years from now somebody on the then-Reddit-equivalent will be referring to future Dreaminliner hull losses as 'inevitable' for the same reason.>>><<<that’s why i said 777 *empennage*>>><<<What's your point though? The issue is (obviously, surely) with pressurisation cycles - the empennage experiences ambient pressure and no pressurisation cycles.>>><<<your initial comment seemed to imply all composites will unpredictably and catastrophically fail just because some idiot designed a crappy submarine, and i gave you an example of an application that has been safely flying for decades without major incident

the empennage is not pressurized but it is still subject to aero forces and fatigue. and ambient pressure obviously changes considerably at altitude>>><<<I never insinuated that all composites will fail. This is what I said:

&gt;My understanding is that with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse, at least difficult compared with conventional metals, and so when they fail it's all at once and somewhat unpredictable (like Titan) - I'd expect the composites to last several decades but then perhaps experience unpredictable and catastrophic failure related perhaps to the pressurisation cycles. I just don't think any of them have been in service long enough currently to be a problem yet.

Notice the reference to pressurisation cycles.

&gt;My understanding is that with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse, at least difficult compared with conventional metals

This is objectively true, regardless of the application of the composite. This doesn't imply that all composites will fail though - it depends on their application.

And regarding the empennage - not sure if you're being purposely obtuse or what, but no, solid metal/composite material being moved between altitudes does not experience anything even remotely comparable to the pressure changes that take place in the fuselage couplings every time the plane undergoes a pressurisation cycle. That isn't to say the empennage can't or won't undergo metal/composite fatigue, but that fatigue is due to completely different physical interactions with the surface of the stabiliser etc. Pressurisation of a container is completely different.>>><<<&gt;empennage

the titan was designed with a window only rated for a third of the depth they travelled 

why are you insistent composite fatigue was the failure and not the viewport collapsing

What are you suggesting I edited?

&gt;why are you insistent composite fatigue was the failure and not the viewport collapsing

Because my profession deals with issues of legal negligence and engineering and I read a number of reports relating to the failure of the Titan's hull, in addition to having an engineering background in materials science.

&gt;the stupid submarine only went on 200 dives according to google. aerospace fatigue limits are an order of magnitude higher than that

It might have been inevitable, but that's because it was a composite material. It isn't like it did one dive and failed on its maiden voyage.>>><<<https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/06/29/titan-submersibles-carbon-fiber/

"The report detailed “numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns,” according to the filing. These included Lochridge’s worry that “visible flaws” in the carbon fiber supplied to OceanGate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during “pressure cycling.” These are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor. He noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had “prevalent flaws.”"

I don’t know if the monochromatic display has anything to do with that. Diffractive waveguides are both incredibly difficult to manufacture and incredibly expensive

Edit: I’m having a mild existential crisis; I think that might not be a diffractive waveguide. I don’t see any input grating. Is the projection coming from behind the display or something?

Edit: punctuation>>><<<My guess would be that it’s because the system was designed to couple with the human eye and not with a cell phone camera. I’m sure there is certainly some sort of reference imaging taking place during manufacturing for quality control purposes... one of the biggest contributors to the cost of waveguide displays is the god-awful yield rate. You’re paying for the display you got, as well as the five others that went into the trash because they had rippling or something

You’re going to fly into that building! >>><<<Can someone explain how they work?>>><<<Head Up Displays work by shining a projection of essential information to a “screen”. The 787 has an overhead projector that essentially almost replicates the PFD. It is a little different, though, as the HUD needs to be less cluttered than the PFD because it is used in situations where the PFD is impractical, like in low visibility weather.

They get this information from the IRSs^(Inertial Reference Systems), which then relay that information to the PFDs and HUDs (in the case of the 787, which has 2 HUDs, one for the captain and one for the first officer).

Edit: typo>>><<<Just to add to this, it doesn't just draw what's on the PFD, it draws it as an overlay to the pilot's view out the windshield so that it augments what is seen when you are looking outside the aircraft. They are also used far more than just in bad weather, any time you are eyes outside they provide relevant data and generally improve SA and safety. They also make landing super easy since they show where you're actually going so there's no need for a "bug spot" or to look for your aim point.>>><<<Yeah, it also projects some other things that aid the pilot to navigate better, like the declutter function, and always shows the FPV so the pilots know exactly where the plane is heading, regardless of the pitch.

So what you're really saying is "there are no good rides, quit asking me guys".>>><<<Absolute coincidence I happened to see a contrail heading west into the US from Europe today over Pennsylvania where I live. The plane seemed to be going quite slow so I looked it up on FlightRadar and saw its ground speed was indeed quite low; only 310 knots in an A330 at 38,000 feet. Heading to Dulles from Heathrow it was going to be a full hour late.>>><<<Can confirm, I just stepped off a JFK-SEA flight that took a hair over 6 hours.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<There’s a lot of plane talk that I don’t understand going on.  >>><<<For the speed part you have to take your indicated airspeed (from your air speed indicator) and add the tailwind speed, or subtract the headwind speed. If your IAS is 200kts and there is a 50kt tailwind, your speed over the ground is 250kts. If you have a 50kt headwind, it’s pushing against you, meaning your speed over the ground is only 150kts. Ever see birds hovering in the air on a windy day? They are flying forward the same speed as they are being pushed back. Air is flowing over their wings for lift, but they aren’t covering any ground.

Edit. This is simplified for direct headwind and tailwind. Wind generally comes from different directions  which means you have to compute your speed over the ground and wind correction, if it’s coming 45 degrees, or a different angle other than head on, your numbers will be different. 

Edit 2: yep, meant TAS, my bad. >>><<<True airspeed is actual what matters. Indicated (or calibrated) airspeed is actually a measurement of the momentum the air has. This decrease greatly with altitude (but may recover some due to compressibility).  At 50000’ 600T is only about 280 indicated. >>><<<Thanks for putting that in plain terms>>><<<You mean plane terms?>>><<<Figured that was a bit too on the nose>>><<<Or just read what the box or ATC tells you.  >>><<<TAS not IAS.>>><<<That's actually not true. Indicated airspeed doesn't have much correlation to ground speed. At FL350 with calm winds a jets indicated airspeed is around 250 knots and ground speed is around 450 knots because true airspeed is around 450 knots.

Ground speed is the true airspeed corrected for wind. Indicated airspeed is going to be significantly lower than true airspeed.>>><<<Just change altitude right? >>><<<I flew four flights yesterday.

I guess there were at high altitude so it didn't pose any issues to the air frame at the barrier?>>><<<FTFA:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And you might notice something about the 801 mph reading — it's above the speed of sound (767 mph). Commercial aircraft ordinarily can't break the sound barrier, because they're not designed to handle the sudden increase in drag and other aerodynamic effects associated with those speeds. Despite a ground speed that high, the **plane didn't come close to reaching that threshold because it was embedded in the swiftly moving air**.

&amp;#x200B;>>><<<So, its like a warp bubble, just for sound and not light?>>><<<No more like the air is moving with the jet.  The air is moving at 200mph relative to the ground.  The plane is moving at its usual 600mph relative to the air.  So relative to the ground, the plane is moving at 800mph>>><<<Aha! This I understand. Finally! After reading all the comments. Got it, thank you. >>><<<Mentour Pilot has a great video about overspeed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbxc\_u5gBWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbxc_u5gBWE)

Edit: and this video about coffin corner [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=easH7ueBKXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=easH7ueBKXc)>>><<<So the air around the jet is moving faster than 801mph- speed of sound? >>><<<That’s a shitty explanation. There was a strong tailwind going exactly the same direction as the aircraft. The plane is still subsonic, but is riding a 200mph-ish wind in the same direction. >>><<<While we're at it, the speed of sound is *not* constant: it depends on temperature. The speed of sound in air, in mph, is 33.5*SQRT(T+459) where T is the Fahrenheit temperature.>>><<<💦Sqrt!💦>>><<<If anyone is curious, the speed of sound, a, is defined as sqrt(γRT), where gamma in air is 1.4, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of the gas. 

So inside jet engines, even with high speed, the gas coming out of the combustor can be be a low Mach number, since the v is high, but so is the temperature. Since mach number is velocity/speed of sound, you can be going faster than the speed of sound at sea level, but you must specify the temperature and the type of gas. The speed of sound at sea level is ~760 mph?, but obviously that changes at altitude, and your velocity is always relative velocity, so a 200 mph tailwind would have you at ~960 mph to break the sound barrier, and would change with altitude. >>><<<Would they be able to hit 960 MPH if the 787 entered a steep dive, say 8,000 FPM or more? 

[This article says they were able to hit M.97 in a steep dive as part of flutter testing, so just a little more “oomph” should have them breaking the sound barrier, right? ](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeings-albaugh-bullish-on-787-flight-test-admits-eating-schedule-margin-339258/) >>><<<Just looked at some standard atmosphere tables, and at 35,000 ft, speed of sound is 660 mph, so they only needed to reach 860 mph ground track with a 200 mph tailwind, so yes they were close. It would be dangerous structurally, as with aerodynamic loading we don’t care about speed, but Mach number and reynolds number (deals with turbulence and stuff), as those actually predict how air will affect surfaces. 

Its important to note it would like running 210 mph on a 200 mph train, so the A/C ground track really doesnt affect anything except how soon the pax arrive. >>><<<I’m sorry I don’t speak freedom units, on the other side of the iron curtain we calculate it as sqrt( gamma * R * T ) where T is in glorious Kelvin.>>><<<Wasnt an explanation it was a question>>><<<Whole airmass is moving that fast. Not close to the sound barrier for the airplane itself. >>><<<Thanks. Sucks to get downvoted for a question. Guess it was dumb.>>><<<It’s a common misconception. Not a dumb question at all. Ground speed vs true airspeed can be kind of hard to wrap your mind around if you’re not familiar. >>><<<Just imagine you're running forward on one of those moving walkways at an airport.>>><<<I'm a pilot and was wondering the same thing. Well, student pilot. Great question though. Fascinating concept, really. Basically the sound equivalent of "warp" travel.

EDIT: OK, I worded this carelessly. To assuage u/LysanderSporker of his concerns, I understand these concepts just fine, and was "wondering" for maybe 5 seconds before I worked it out.

So cool.>>><<<I gave your original question an upvote to try and help you out lol.>>><<<Respect>>><<<Is it possible for a jet to abruptly exit such an airmass, where it would briefly become supersonic?>>><<<No. You are literally being pushed by the wind. Your TAS Mach number doesn’t change. If your tailwind goes from 200kts to zero, all you lose is groundspeed. The airplane itself is still flying the same speed. >>><<<I am pretty sure that's incorrect. If the air instantly stopped moving (which won't happen) your groundspeed would remain the same and your airspeed would increase (conservation of momentum), this would of course quickly reduce back to the original airspeed.

This is basically how dynamic soaring works.>>><<<This is correct>>><<<You’re right. I was answering from a more practical sense of losing the tailwind, not instantaneous. >>><<<I think your answer is correct your explanation is wrong. If the plane could somehow pass through an invisible wall that would stop the 250 mph tailwind, and the plane breaks through into still air its groundspeed would remain the same, and it would suddenly be supersonic. That's pretty obvious.

The explanation of why that doesn't happen is that air nearly never changes speeds that quickly. And if you did find that kind of speed gradient the turbulence from the shear would be extremely intense.>>><<<That makes more sense. My only context for this is the jet stream graphic I see next to the weather man>>><<<How fast would it be going in indicated air speed?>>><<<Honestly...I don’t pay too much attention to indicated airspeed once we transition to mach, but somewhere in the range of 230-260 indicated and mach .77 to .85 for the faster guys. >>><<<Bearing in mind that at such high pressure altitudes and low temperatures the IAS could well be a few hundred knots below the EAS. Mach numbers are used at altitude as the TAS for exceeding the critical Mach number becomes a lot lower as the speed of sound decreases in the cold air. >>><<<Flew from Philly to Michigan last night at FL340 doing about 290kts over the ground...

I believe an RAF Voyager experienced a similar upset after the captain accidentally lodged a camera against the sidestick when shifting the seat.>>><<<As a former 787 FA: operating the seats in the flight deck is part of our training.  It’s a basic to help in case of pilot incapacitation.   

Both in order to perform first aid such as chest compressions and also to prevent a pilot having a seizure or similar to push against the controls/ pedals. 

 I’m not saying it’s impossible a FA pushed that button upon serving a meal… but it seems highly unlikely. Also given how spacious the flight deck is. It’s not like on the 737, where you operate 30 buttons with your skull if you don’t duck down. >>><<<As a mechanic, that cockpit space makes me so jealous.>>><<<Real. I’ve been in many flight decks.

Smells fishy… seems like Boeing needs someone to blame or the crew does… perhaps there were other activities on the flight deck that caused a sudden control input.>>><<<I’m not a pilot, but I’d bet $1k what happened is the seat moved forward, and then after, the pilot tried to push it back bracing against the stick. Thus pushing the nose down>>><<<I don’t want to believe that hah, but if the bird-brained pilot was sitting cross-legged as reported perhaps he kicked the stick accidentally in a panic.>>><<<You’re terrible at betting then. It’s an electric seat, no need to brace against anything. At most the manual controls allow you to push the feet with the floor to provide more than enough opposing force.>>><<<I guess so, if the pilot had their knee or another body part directly on the yoke. 

That would for sure cause a control input but I can’t really imagine that it would lead to such a violent dive. 
[not a 787 pilot here, merely flying a C172]>>><<<I’m not 787 rated either, but

On Airbus, you can apply a slight force on the joystick without disconnecting the AP. When it does disconnect, it means you have gone over a certain threshold, meaning your input onto the stick is already not negligible - hence an initial abrupt movement (if my theory applies to Boeing, which I’m not sure about)

And then, if the nose down moment was caused by the seat pushing forward (and not the leg) then the pilots would try to pull up, and it would last, maybe, one second, maybe more, to realise why they can’t (they are in the cruise phase, hungry, and smelling their meal approaching, remember ?)
During that time the nose-down input continues, until they realise what blocks the control column, and move the seat, and pull up, from a huge negative pitch


Of course if the leg was what moved the control column, then the affected pilot would know right away, and would start moving the seat backwards without the “investigation” time>>><<<I was thinking the exact same thing. How likely was it that they were doing degenerate and immoral acts inside of that cockpit? Cause that seems quite likely to me.>>><<<maybe the FA was jumping on the D of the pilot>>><<<I haven't seen anything yet that made much sense.>>><<<They flew a plane back across the Pacific Ocean that had just plunged previously without waiting for the investigation. So much sense!>>><<<I mean, that's not fishy. They got the FDR and the CVR, the plane seems fine, and they got the pilots to interview. There's no reason to keep the plane in New Zealand.>>><<<I think what they were attempting to say is that if the sudden nose-down pitch was caused by something that the pilots could not control, it would be a risk to fly that same plane over a large body of water…for hours upon hours. 

So maybe either a) they (the airline) knew pretty quick that it was due to pilot commands, or b) they don’t really mind risking and sacrificing crew to get the plane back.>>><<<I mean, once they got the FDR readouts (or the crew's statements), it must've been obvious that the plane itself was fine>>><<<Over water better than over land amirite.>>><<<It absolutely is, if a FCS failure is suspected, lmao.>>><<<Cycled jet, stale data gone.

It just says certain instruments may show unreliable outputs to the pilots without any indicator that it's invalid. >>><<<Google uncommanded descent b787. Stale data can even make the screens freeze.>>><<<Yes, except that a shutdown wouldn’t cause the plane to go into a dive. There would be no input which would let the plane just glide for a bit. 

The theory with the chair makes much more sense. And a pilot that fucked up maybe wouldn’t own up to that and instead blame the instruments.>>><<<That seems more likely than blaming it on a flight attendant. Managers make their living by shifting blame.>>><<<software problems has to be the answer tbh. I seriously never want to get on another boeing plane again.>>><<<Anyone out there have a picture of this button of death?

The pilot made a boneheaded maneuver and pushed on the yoke when trying to slide the seat back.>>><<<That’s my take. I’m going with pilot induced. He didn’t even address the pax after it happened. It was only later that he said, “My ‘instruments’ went blank.” Okay, pal. I don’t buy it. 
(30 years in the industry)>>><<<100% accurate - no announcement was made after the event from the captain other than a harried audio in Spanish that I caught "medico" and I assumed was asking if anyone has medical experience. This was not immediate either - minutes passed before that was said. Passengers we're already in the aisle trying to help the injured. The flight attendants were MIA immediately after as well (at least as far as what I could see in the middle cabin).>>><<<Doesn’t the “fly by wire” programming prevent the maneuvering from roughing the pax?>>><<<Fly by wire protects the airplane, which can handle alot! The unsecured meatbags in the cabin however, they will go flying. An airliner can easly pull 3-4g's, and probably -1g which when unsecured will send you hugging the ceiling, and when the pilot then goes "oh shit" and pulls out of the dive, you come slaming down at 2-3 times gravity. Keep your seatbelts on! (If uncomfortable loosen them a bit, but not as much so you could slide out if newton decides to yank you upwards.)>>><<<Unsecured Meatbags is the name of my new Grindcore outfit, come through we're playing Franklin's basement this friday night. 

For real though, I always ask "How do you think it would go if someone held you by your ankles off an upper floor balcony, and dropped you onto pavement?"

It's not. You need to lift the cover to move the seat backwards and just press the cover to move it forwards.>>><<<… which is why it’s safe>>><<<[https://twitter.com/jrmartinezf/status/1768419655834632333](https://twitter.com/jrmartinezf/status/1768419655834632333)

Absolutely not safe. Just touching the cover moves the seat forward.>>><<<Ok that one clip is sped up. That move as slow as I would expect.>>><<<Neither of those show what we're talking about.  We need to see how to move the seat FORWARD.  Let's say the pilot uses the switch in those videos to move the seat back.  Then the pilot sits down.  How do they move the seat forward from the seated position?>>><<<You didn’t watch the second video then>>><<<787 driver here, the seat doesn’t move that fast. I don’t buy this story. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where I (or anyone else) would be up that tight on the yoke that an inadvertent activation of that switch would cause this, and it just doesn’t seem likely. The seat moves faster in manual mode via the levers on the side of the seat, with their use the seat slides freely along the tracks.>>><<<As per my previous comment, what if you were sitting cross-legged?>>><<<The second the seat starts moving you’d say something and it would stop. It requires a decent amount of force to push through the autopilot control and disengage it via yoke movement. Plausible? Yes. Likely? I don’t think so.>>><<<And even if a tray was caught against the yoke and the button got stuck on (stay with me) are the flight controls that sensitive that pushing the stick forward at that speed would violently snap the nose down?

Or once the stick is pushed beyond the autopilot resistance, would it snap down like that?

Really can’t believe they are blaming a power seat here.>>><<<There is a bit of a “jolt” associated with the override when you forcefully push through the servos, but I can’t see it violently nosing the aircraft over. This is all speculation on my behalf mind you, but it just doesn’t really make a lot of sense to me.>>><<<Assuming auto pilot is on what does the yoke do when pushed forward?  For much resistance would there be? Whole thing seems strange. And seems like pilot will be to blame with available info at the moment

“A flight attendant (stewardess) visiting the cockpit to serve them food rested her elbow on the cover of the switch that electrically moves the seat to store it. The seat proceeded to move forward, pushing the captain against the joystick as he was apparently **sitting cross-legged**. When the lever was pressed, the autopilot (AP) was disconnected and a brief nosedive began”>>><<<Ah so cross legged was the issue. Cause the seats have a cut in them which allows for them to slide way forward literally into the stick.

Very surprised the button was able to be actuated through the plastic cover. They are fairly stout.>>><<<Does the AP back drive the column/wheel on the 87?


If so it all makes sense. The relatively slow motorized seat pushing into the column by way of crossed legs, the AP servos initially resisting the motion allowing the force to build up like a spring, and then when the AP force override logic tripped and disconnected the AP the column slammed forward rapidly and everyone went for a ride.>>><<<Is the implication then that the pilots are lying? How much trouble are they in?>>><<<If the cover was damaged or somehow misaligned/improperly installed as appears to be the case in the linked video, the seat could have kept moving when she removed her elbow. It’s plausible that it would take a couple seconds for everyone to process what was happening and correct it.

* The passenger lied for attention.
* The pilot explained badly, or the passenger misunderstood. Passengers are not known for giving accurate testimony about aviation. 
  *   There's the possibility that a language barrier was an issue here: one report mentions that the pilot was speaking to passengers in Spanish. The passenger was interviewed in English, and it's not clear how strong the passenger's Spanish is, or how strong is the pilot's English.
* The pilot lied to the passenger. /r/flying leads me to believe that pilots lie to passengers frequently ("We sugarcoat and water down things, because people don't care and frankly don't always need to know. This isn't wildly different than any other technical field with a large public interaction component."). It's not hard for me to believe that the pilot lied about a mistake to avoid being yelled at by a bunch of upset passengers.>>><<<I'm pretty sure by law, they have to have announcements in English for this exact reason?>>><<<Vast majority of the announcements throughout the flight were in Spanish. Sometimes there was an attempt made at English, though usually either very halting or carefully spoken. 
After the event, there was a harried announcement in Spanish that I caught the word "medico" - I assume they were asking for people with medical experience. No follow up was given in English until almost time to land.>>><<<The question I have still not seen asked nor answered is what was the pilot doing out of the cockpit, talking the passengers, right after an incident like that?>>><<<I’m guessing they were back in the cabin to assess the damage and injuries. But good point on leaving the cockpit of a potentially broken plane.>>><<<He did not come to the cabin until after landing and after the medical crews were on board.>>><<<The pilot came back to the cabin after landing and after the medical crews were onboard.>>><<<Oh you didn't know? "All the screens went blank" is what pilots say instead of "Life flashed before my eyes".>>><<<Posted a video to another comment, it's not lightning fast. If you're already pretty close then it might not take much to start running out of room.>>><<<If you were slammed forward, you probably can’t see the ‘screens’, so they might as well as been blank lol>>><<<Yeah I’m wondering about this. 

But the seat also could have malfunctioned. I remember one incident in which the seat lock broke and the captain fell backwards. So maybe the seat was broken, but we only found out when the switch was pressed? Still can’t reconcile the different testimonies tho.>>><<<I had a look at the QRH the other night, and it mentions if all the displays blank, first thing to do is ensure the autopilot is in basic modes eg. heading and alt. Then it gets you to reset the CCR’s. 

I’m wondering if the there has been some sort of systems failure leading to the CCR’s rebooting and that’s what caused the pitch down, as it would’ve been in LNAV/VNAV.>>><<<They mention there was a cover. I guess this either means it was broken or the flight attendant made a terrible choice. >>><<<The cover is the article

Remember the pilot saying screens shut off and they lost control in previous quote so this doesnt line up.>>><<<That’s just a rumor.>>><<<"while serving a meal" yeah right..>>><<<Need to blow the autopilot…..>>><<<Ding ding>>><<<Cowgirl position would have done the trick.>>><<<so glad i wasn't the only one thinking this - i had to keep scrolling way down>>><<<Jesus christ can you imagine, babies being thrown into the ceiling cause the pilot was getting some tail>>><<<The circle of life>>><<<Was the pilots name Otto?>>><<<Otto Fellatio>>><<<Is there any chance Otto Pilot was getting re-inflated?>>><<<Just as an update, CC-BGG, the aircraft involved, returned to service yesterday in a commercial flight to Miami.>>><<<Not sure I buy the FA hitting the switch thing but it has been pretty obvious since the beginning that this was in some way caused by events on the flight deck.>>><<<The seat doesn’t move that fast. This doesn’t make any sense. That would be such a slow-motion catastrophe.>>><<<We know time moves faster further away from the earth, maybe that's a clue?>>><<<Those electric seats are painfully slow. 

And the back electric switch is covered. 

I don’t buy it.>>><<<It’s obvious the Captain was clapping the FA’s cheeks in the cockpit. She was definitely serving that meal.>>><<<If this turns out to be true and she was injured as a result, hard to feel anything except she deserves it. The pilot too. Odd he didn’t address them after recovery. Ashamed? So many pax hurt.>>><<<I literally read this book last week. Airframe by Michael Crichton.>>><<<Why do planes not have an interrupt or stick shaker safety mechanism for inputs outside of a normal flight? There’s not a lot of scenarios where a pilot would command an extended full nose down. There should be some stopper in the system for stuff like that, commanding a full stall, extended extremely steep bank, etc.>>><<<This always seems to happen that the first bit of “investigation leak/results” always happens to blame the pilot before the real analysis is complete.  Not saying that’s not possible (though this explanation is pretty unlikely imo), but it was done with both 737 max investigations before Boeing admitted they were at fault.>>><<<Was the attendant trying to sit on the pilot’s lap?>>><<<As others of said, I’m guessing the pilot made a mistake trying to adjust the seat and accidentally pushed hard on the yoke>>><<<Not sure that I buy it. The captain made mention that they momentarily lost all of their instrumentation. I’m a US pilot at a major airline. However, I will also caveat that I have never flown the 787. Here’s the AV Herald link. Check out the airworthiness directive put out by the FAA about this years ago.

It also doesn’t move at the speed of light>>><<<Doesn't mean the cover was actually there. It's a piece of plastic, I wonder if it was missing?>>><<<How does moving the seat explain an uncontrolled dive? If the FA moved the seat forward and the pilot pushed the control yoke forward putting the aircraft into a nose down movement, how would they not just be able to pull it back? That doesn’t make any sense>>><<<Maybe his leg was between the seat and the control when it moved forwards. Could have been hard to get it unstuck>>><<<That would make sense if the rumor that the pilot was sitting cross legged is true.>>><<<Uh, they did?  Didn’t the passengers say it lasted only a few seconds.>>><<<Correct. I didn't have a timer going (obviously) but I'd guess 2-3 seconds total? Felt like forever but it was so quick there was little time to react or compensate before leveling off.>>><<<This is going to be the first safety report in aviation with the term .....reverse cowboy...in it...😬😬😬>>><<<I used to have this Acura, where I got a quarter stuck in the seat rail, and it caused it to move around until I dislodged it. That’s the first thing I thought of.>>><<<Such an accident isn't possible on a glorious Airbus. Imagine not having a sidestick in current year.>>><<<Is it me or "flight shame" about to get replaced by "legitimate terror to fly in a Boeing plane" 😆. >>><<<Im thinking this was sex related>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<on the other hand, a pilot could be taking heat off himself and crew as well.>>><<<This kinda seems more likely to me. The event cascade considering all the redundancies in aircraft, for every single screen to go blank AND have an aircraft maneuver hard enough to cause injuries, is pretty steep. Not a 787 mech though, so that's just my speculation until we know more.>>><<<But why lie when you know you’re going to be found out in a follow up investigation? It just makes it worse. Also the fact a pilot would knowingly lie about something so serious is a bit unsettling>>><<<To be fair we don't know of the pilot lied or even said anything at all. All we have is the media saying a passenger said the pilot said so and so.>>><<<That’s a good point>>><<<Does that make it worse? Lying to investigators would be one thing. If lying to passengers is a crime there's a whole lot of pilots who ought to be worried.>>><<<So the screens going blank for a moment was BS?>>><<<Its was BS from the moment it was said, but the media knew people would eat that up to hear "another problem with BOEING!!!

Lol>>><<<I saw a video of it being operated and it has a cover over the switch you have to lift up then you can push the switch to the side to make the seat move. So maybe the cover was broken and missing or something.>>><<<I think that’s my personal record for downvotes 💥>>><<<It's possible a special livery was applied that is being kept wrapped up for an official unveiling. 

Or they had to re-do the tail section only and masked off the rest, but they'd typically remove all that stuff in the paint shops, and they typically use a sort of paper based masking product instead of all plastic. 

Or the fuselage has been stripped of all coatings but it needs to spend some time outside so they covered up all the exposed fuselage from UV damage.>>><<<Good points! Although it looks like it never got any kind of special livery.

I think your last point may be the most likely. It didn't leave Everett for 4 months until it was given over to AA.>>><<<It does look like they only covered up the solid white part while leaving the tail which has the extra red and blue exposed. Not sure why but I'm guessing there was something different about the solid white section, maybe one less layer to paint or maybe they wanted to mask off the solid white while painting the tail livery.>>><<<The solid white is an extremely strong coating that will completely protect the plane.>>><<<Airplane paint is extremely tough and durable. It is way thicker and tougher than automotive paint!>>><<<The "black tape" is exactly in line with the livery on the tail. Pretty sure they're either treating or waiting for the unveil - they could also be waiting for lawyers to approve>>><<<If there is a 787 in Everett it's there for rework.
So when they paint they only painted the worked spot

*Source I work there>>><<<Intersting. This was taken back in April 2022, did that still apply back then?>>><<<They've been doing the 47/48 section rework since 2021so it's pretty likely.>>><<<If it didn't leave for 4 months then that's probably for protection, especially from the kind of hail and wind Washington State can get. Plastic-wrapping it like that is probably cheaper than the maintainence on 4 months of damage from exposure to the elements, even if it's only partial and they still need to touch up the coating on the tail and wings. It probably also insulates the interior and limits the need to heat the plane to prevent freezing.>>><<<I wonder what the full cost to do that would be?>>><<<The plane is now in service, and it has the standard AA livery. So it was likely the 4th point. You can also see that the exposed engine is in a white color, while the normal AA 787 livery has the entire body (including the engines) in a gray color. 

The 787 is made of carbon fiber, which they don't like to keep out in the sun exposed. Movement of 787s happens at night when they are being built to protect against the sun. But since this plane needed to be out in the day, they likely slapped a protective white coat of paint on the engines while wrapping the body (which presumably still needed to be painted) to protect the carbon fiber.>>><<<2022 lots of planes were delayed in delivery due to COVID.  Lots of planes were put into short term storage.  Covered up any and all possible places that could get water or any damage.

CHS was overrun with 787's awaiting delivery and there were no empty spaces anywhere on the Boeing ramp.>>><<<Bedbugs, probably.>>><<<This !  It was fogged inside>>><<<Interesting thread. So many responses, no correct answers. It most likely does not have an interior installed and is destined for very long term storage. They wrap the entire fuselage because it's quick and easy and ensures the wrap stays put. They used to tape a stip of plastic over the windows, but that proved to be a maintenance nightmare. The reason the windows must be covered is because there are no physical window shades, especially if the interior isn't there. And sunlight will send in UV rays and eat any exposed carbon fiber (without the interior, it's all exposed, no protective paint). So, this guy looks to be going to sit for a bit. But not for too long since the engines are still there. Or the order to storage came late and the engines will be removed in position on the flight line.>>><<<I have VERY close contact with the 787 program. The UV exposure issue can manifest even during a move of the unfinished fuselage between buildings. This is only done at night when the composite fuselage us bare.>>><<<So no jedi pilot training, dang.

So the carbon fiber/resin/composites are only good with a coat of paint?>>><<<Yep. I remember when they started freaking out when we parked the development aircraft outside during moves. Then 10 to 22 sat gutted for a number of years. A lot of lessons were learned about proper care and storage of 787s.>>><<<Wonder if the Titan hull had the same precautions taken as far as limiting UV exposure?>>><<<That's scary af>>><<<The fuselage is primed which is the corrosion protection layer. The top coat is only to protect that and to look good. Most likely a special livery or some kind of test.>>><<<This is a 787 so no corrosion inhibitor>>><<<On aluminum airplanes the coating is Alodine, which is light green, but a factory fresh 787 should be white when it leaves the factory with no livery. The factory paint is to protect the joints and fasteners exactly as you say.>>><<<The bolt still can corrode. They are the same same a conventional fuselage.>>><<<There are surprisingly few exposed "bolts". On the -8, there were a ton, which was really stupid,  and this was changed with the subsequent models. Still, no CIC or primer. There's a UV protection coating on the CFRP that's why they're a tan/grey color when unpainted. Otherwise they would be black without paint.>>><<<Fasteners installed in composite material have special coating requirements. They don’t go back and paint each one after installing them, unlike in fuel tanks where everything gets cap sealed>>><<<The 787 is made of carbon fibre.  It begins to break down in direct sunlight without anything protecting it.  

When I was building these planes in Charleston, all the sub assembly moves were done at night to protect the carbon fibre.  When a suprise line move happened during daylight, we all had to get out a brush and slop a quick layer of white base paint on it so it could be rolled across the street.  

Sidenote: I don't know what kind of paint it is but MAN is it durable.  I dripped a little on a pair of shoes and now today, 10 years later, the shoes are a worn wreck but those drips look brand new.>>><<<Which explains why they've not wrapped the AA tail livery as it looks like that's some sort of plastic wrap.>>><<<I work close to the 787 program, can confirm 787 fuselages only move at night due to UV exposure accumulation.>>><<<787s are confirmed to be vampires.>>><<<Carbon fiber ≠ carbon fiber reinforced plastic>>><<<It’s for IFR training, for both pilots and passengers>>><<<IFR taxiing would be especially challenging. :)>>><<<Garmin with synthetic vision? Lol>>><<<You just have to do it by feel>>><<<That felt like a blue light.>>><<<Special on taxiway golf?>>><<<That felt like a truck.>>><<<Whoops, there's the ILS array!>>><<<Ah yes let’s play airside braille!>>><<<Marco!>>><<<I feel like i'm using a lot more thrust than normal>>><<<SMGCS!>>><<<I'm tired of all these MSFS passengers on this MSFS plane!!>>><<<Sorry yo ask, can you please eli5 what this means?>>><<<I think it is a joke. IFR or Instrument Flight Rules flying is where navigation is done by reference to instruments only. This contrasts with VFR or Visual Flight Rules flying where pilotage, navigation by reference to visual landmarks, is the norm.

During training for IFR flight, students will often wear some kind of view limiting device, such as frosted over safety glasses, to limit how much of the world outside the cockpit can be seen. This allows IFR training to be conducted in good weather.

This business of wrapping the entire plane would be an ultimate view limiting device, and would apply to passengers as well as pilots.>>><<<IFR = Instrument Flight Rules, the opposite of VFR (visual), required to be able to fly through clouds and situations where you need to rely on instruments and not what you can see. They're joking that it could be used for IFR training because all the windows are covered.>>><<<VFR = Visual Flight Rules. You need to be able to see where you're going, you can't fly into clouds, and you're responsible for keeping away from other aircraft. You don't need a flight plan, and you don't need to talk to ATC unless you're going through a controlled sector, such as near a major airport.

IFR = Instrument Flight Rules. You're using only instruments to fly the plane, you don't need to see where you're going. You can fly in any safe weather conditions. You always have a flight plan, and you'll be talking to ATC the whole time, they'll tell you where to go and are responsible for keeping you away from other aircraft. Airline flights always use IFR.>>><<<LOL>>><<<They didn’t want another unexpected baby Dreamliner to appear.>>><<<So, like a CRJ?>>><<<That’s a bad dream>>><<<It’s a stealth coating>>><<<They can't ***see*** you kicking off passengers if they can't ***see*** the airplane>>><<<Termites>>><<<Solved!>>><<<or bed bugs>>><<<Or Walter White>>><<<Jesse, it’s time to cook!!>>><<<Waltuh!>>><<<Todd really does a good job, doesn't he?>>><<<They're cooking meth inside?>>><<<Pretty clever.>>><<<Funny, fumigation was my first thought too.>>><<<Same, had bed bugs on the mind.

Having it last as long in the extreme conditions (high UV, extreme/fast temperature swings etc.) shortens the service life &amp; costs to make them worse than paint so far.

https://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/boeing-787-dreamliner>>><<<Very cool. I assume you got to your destination early because of the tailwind.>>><<<Yeah, we typically have to slow down on this leg SYD-SFO bc we run about an hour early. Customs doesn’t open until 0600 and waiting at the gate is never fun.>>><<<I see. Also, is cruising at FL 410 common? I've never been on a flight with cruising altitude that high.>>><<<In the 787 it’s normal. Lower on long legs is unusual. Ceiling is FL430 and we fly it there too, no issues.>>><<<I have yet to fly on the 787. I need to do it someday. Have flown mostly on the 777, especially for long haul.

Edit: Or the 777X when it enters service.>>><<<The 787 is a whole different animal. Electric pressurization, electric de ice, so it QUIET and the air is humidified and the cabin is lower altitude. It’s all around nicer. People say the 777 is better to fly, but I don’t know, cause I’m not typed on it.>>><<<I would imagine the 787 would be more comfortable, due to the fact that it is pressurised to a lower altitude. It probably helps pilots out, too.>>><<<Lots more comfortable for us. Whisper quiet lowers fatigue.>>><<<Wow! This is my first time having a conversation with a pilot of a commercial airliner.

Love the 787 feel.>>><<<Can confirm here as well. I flew on the 787 from San Francisco to Heathrow and it was a dream but I deeply regret not choosing an A380 now that they’re being retired>>><<<Whoa, TIL. Never flown on a 787 before, mostly older models (long haul nonstop 777 flights) and damn, I never had really any issues per se, but I always thought the feeling of flying could be helped at least a little, huh.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I've done BOS-OSL and LGW-BOS on a 787.  Best flights I've ever taken.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yes. It uses electric powered cabin air compressors to provide pressurization to the air cycle machines. It also has electric starter/generators and you can start both at the same time. This machine has 6 generators each putting out the same amount of power as those huge hospital backup generators that are in shipping containers. 
If all 6 generators were online and pumping at 100%, the 787 could supply enough power for a small town, with businesses and about 800 household at peak power usage. 
This thing is a marvel.>>><<<Man what a machine, future AME here hoping to get a type certificate on that thing one day.>>><<<The earlier fins were NOT quiet. The Lower recirc fans were so loud. Sometimes you would just forget to switch it on...>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<No. It’s not the same one. The two are similar but the systems are WAY to different.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yes. This is accurate.>>><<<Meanwhile I've never flown in a wide body plane.>>><<<I see Gulfstreams at FL430-FL450 and surprised me me the big guys don’t go up there more...>>><<<Most of the time corporates aren’t operating at gross since our mission isn’t to pack the jet and move as much paying cargo (self-loading or otherwise) as possible from A to B. That said, even full of gas and operating at gross, we typically climb straight to FL400 or FL410 depending on direction of flight and we step up from there as we burn down.

I don’t think very many airliners are certified above FL430, and most airliners (787 excepted) very rarely operate light enough to get even that high. An empty airliner is losing money at a staggering rate. The G-III and G-IV are certified to FL450 and everything after that is certified to FL510. We rarely get to 51, as you have to be *really* light. Like, less fuel on board than we typically land with on a beautiful VMC day. You can occasionally get there at the end of a really long leg where you’re stretching the range and are over somewhere with lots of good alternates with good weather, or in the tropics where the tropopause is so high that the temp aloft approaches -80C, but again, only if we’re light.>>><<<The 787 can typically climb directly to FL400 or FL410 at max gross. It’s got big engines with SO much thrust that we cruise around at 85% power at Mach 84. 
Also, it’s not accurate to say that large airliners burn a whole lot of fuel. This airplane, mid weight going .85 will burn roughly 9k pph TOTAL. I flew a 787-9 from Sydney to SFO loaded with PPE and it was light and saw burns dip into the 8k range, again for both engines combined! 

I am typed in lots of Gulfstreams and I remember the 4 burning around 3.5k at slower speed. This airplane can carry 330 ppl and 10s of thousands of pounds of cargo for less than 3 times the fuel burn. Also maintenance costs are incredibly low due to high use programs. 
This shocked me when I jumped from corporate to airline. These things are smooth, fast and incredibly efficient.>>><<<That’s actually pretty insane, quite the machine. The 650 is 2.5k-3k at mid weights at .90, but not with 330 pax and 10 tons of LD3s! Thanks for the perspective.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<We don’t always insert the decimal.

The certified max altitude in my plane is FL410 but we more commonly fly at FL350-FL370>>><<<When I used to fly to Brazil, I want to say there never broke FL335 which really surprised me but now that you mention weight, that makes sense. I want to say they were usually 767’s...>>><<<I have family in Brazil so I travel from the US to Brazil a lot. Usually they step climb over the duration of the flight so they will be around FL310 when I fall asleep, but I often wake up to the plane up at FL390 or higher.>>><<<Wait... you could actually sleep?!?! If I wasn’t shivering from coldness there was always some reason I couldn’t sleep! And if I did, it was on the hop from SP to GIG (45 minute)!>>><<<I've gotten the nice lay flat seats with a blanket a pretty good number of times going to Sao Paulo. Since we're always going down to see family and have no real agenda we try to plan trips around times when there are lots of open seats, or open first class. One time I was the only person out of 25 first class seats. The flight attendant just gave me a bottle of wine and told me to ring the call bell if I needed anything else so she didn't have to keep getting up.>>><<<First time i flew on the 787, i was surprised to hear the pilot announce we were at 40,000 feet.>>><<<Smooth as silk. :-)>>><<<I’ll bite, what about this tells you that there is a tailwind?    Super curious>>><<<Top-left of the Heads Up Display, there is an arrow pointing up with “48” next to it. It shows the direction the wind is going towards. Also, bottom left all the picture, right in the corner, there is the same arrow (or at least half of it), and you can make out 24x°/48, which is consistent with the display on the HUD, showing that the wind is coming from heading 24x° (so towards 60° or so) at 48 knots. Hope this helps!>>><<<That's awesome.  Thanks for the info!>>><<<There is an arrow pointing up on the upper left of the HUD, that’s the wind direction. Looks like a 48 knot tail wind.>>><<<I’m curious. Is the tailwind on the HUD?>>><<<Yea, top left>>><<<Found it! Thank you!>>><<<&gt;Very cool. I assume you got to your destination early because of the tailwind.

[ACARS\_chime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ACARS_chime/) , how did you know where OP was flying or that they reached early because of tailwind? I know nothing about aviation but wondering how you figured that out by looking at the photo?>>><<<What tailwinds do is increase an aircraft's ground speed (GS), which is speed relative to the ground. Not only does flying in a tailwind help aircraft arrive faster, but it also reduces fuel consumption and engine wear since the engines don't have to work as hard to achieve a high GS.

Fun fact: On Feb 9 2020, a British Airways 747-400 broke the record for fastest subsonic transatlantic flight (New York to London) thanks to a jetstream providing tailwinds &gt; 200 mph. The flight reached a top GS of 825 mph and the journey was completed in 4 hrs 56 mins.

Sadly, British Airways retired its Queen of the Skies fleet in July 2020.>>><<<I like your username. :p>>><<<Haha thanks! I was deciding what username to use and I thought cockpit sounds so I just went for it.>>><<<Hello from Brand A :) (A350)

I gotta love Boeing for the simplicity and the tank-like build of the -400.  
But the ergonomics of the bus is just something else (no clue about the 787)>>><<<Never flown a bus but I've been in the 74-4 sim a fair bit. Chuck you in a 78 you would figure it out quick enough..

I hate that with the 787 HUD, I have hit my head on it so many times. In cruise I would often throw it up. Because unless your sitting in the perfect position  its useless.

+1 for Airbus>>><<<It's not. The photo is just taken closer to the display unit than OPs picture

We also don't use it in the cruise. We stow it passing 15000 going up and deploy it TOD>>><<<Seems like another nice little creature comfort design by Airbus. From what I've seen, they really seem to pay attention to that sort of stuff. https://youtu.be/NbBa3_GKkaI>>><<<That’s so beautiful>>><<<They can’t call it an artificial horizon anymore...>>><<<Fun fact. The horizon on the HUD is above the real horizon due to the curvature of the earth at FL410.>>><<<Yep. Theirs a note for it during training

There’s*>>><<<Grammar mistakes aside, that’s actually pretty interesting.>>><<<Guidance is called a “flight path vector” and the line is just zero degrees pitch...it is the horizon still...kinda. Lol>>><<<In our airplane its called the "zero path reference line". You put the plane on that line and it will not climb nor will it descend.>>><<<At 40,000 feet, how close to stall speed is 250 knots?>>><<<We are not close at all! 
It’s actually right there on the speed tape. The max speed is denoted by the blocks up top that show around 280 or so, and the low speed stall is NOT shown on bottom bc it’s actually off the tape. You do see the beginning of the “caution band” starting down there but actual stalk is REALLY low bc this wing is just that good. If I wanted to look it up, I could tell you precisely, but trust, it’s no where even close to where you’d fly.>>><<<It’s hard to say. For safety reasons, and because weight can vary quite a lot, airliners don’t typically list a stall speed, nor do pilots ever operate the aircraft with a stall speed in mind. Depending on the operator, what you’ll usually see described is something like a “minimum maneuvering speed” which is 10-25% higher than the actual calculated stall speed. Since we’re just after a rough estimate here, we can go by the VREF value of 137 knots listed on the HUD. This is the final “over the fence” landing speed in the landing configuration at landing weight. Some carriers calculate VREF as 1.25x the actual stall speed. I’ll let you run the numbers on that, but we can safely say that 250 knots is 100+ knots over stall speed. FL410 is high, but not quite that high where you experience the “coffin corner” effect that you might at higher altitudes.>>><<<And here the MMO is shown by the blocks at the top of the tape. It’s around Mach .89 or .90
We regularly fly these around .88>>><<<I can't speak for a 787, but in my jet the shaker will go off around 200 knots at that altitude. It varies a little with different weather conditions but the low speed cue is usually near 200.>>><<<He has transitioned to Mach instead of knots and is doing .84 Mach. Honestly probably closer to a high speed stall then anything else.>>><<<&gt; high speed stall

Huh, I had no idea this was a thing. Interesting (and scary)>>><<<What is the 252 number on the left?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<**[Indicated airspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated airspeed)**

Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed read directly from the airspeed indicator (ASI) on an aircraft, driven by the pitot-static system. It uses the difference between total pressure and static pressure, provided by the system, to either mechanically or electronically measure dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure includes terms for both density and airspeed. Since the airspeed indicator cannot know the density, it is by design calibrated to assume the sea level standard atmospheric density when calculating airspeed.

When doing oceanic crossings, ATC will assign a Mach number to fly for procedural separation. In aircraft I've flown, once at altitude I could set my airspeed indicator to display knots true vs indicated which was a better reference and trend to help maintain a designated Mach without auto throttles.>>><<<Thanks for sharing. I find the cockpit displays fascinating. I have had to program simulated HUDS that ran off of real-time telemetry as part of the RDT&amp;E process. These are done so that Flight Test Engineers can see the data on the ground in a similar format to what the pilot sees. We have a whole "Human Factors" group that analyzes the psychological perspective of display readability. I miss the old days when passengers could visit the cockpit (with pilot permission of course).>>><<<Why are commercial huds so cluttered?>>><<<I agree but don’t have an answer. There is a de clutter mode, but no one uses it bc it just gets rid of the instrument lines and leaves a lot of floating numbers.>>><<<Ah. Bad design then? Also maybe stupid question but why is the std pressure set at 3010?>>><<<Not a stupid question. It’s set to STD (for operations above the transition altitude) and 30.10 is actually on standby. That means we’ve gotten the pressure of our landing field and preset it. When we hit the center of the set knob, it will toggle from STD to 30.10inhg
This would happen at 18,000 assuming we are using standard transition level, which we are here.>>><<<Thanks for answering. Does it automatically switch through 18K or do you manually do it, or can you program it to switch at a certain altitude or FL if you're flying outside North America?>>><<<It does not switch automatically but it turns from green to another color...I forget what color and it somehow knows the transition level no matter where you are. (Gets it from the chart database) Pure magic. :-)>>><<<Ah, yes, PFM lol>>><<<If you fuck up and switch too early. Then are given a lower level off alt. The plane will actually use the appropriate altimeter setting. 

Took me a minute to figure that one out. When the plane leveled off at 4300' out of LHR instead of 4000'>>><<<It actually gets it from the descent winds page which you can change from the defaults if you need to.>>><<<The 787 also compares the wind on the flight plan to the track, gps correction angles and gps ground speed. It’s a composite. It’s very smart.>>><<<I was going to ask the same. Assumed standby. Interesting they don’t denote the baro setting in use more obviously. Such as with a rectangle around it or something similar.>>><<<I agree. But the one in use is the large one, and the standby setting will only appear once you set it...meaning once you climb up and hit the STD button it disappears until you set it on the other end and bring it back.>>><<<Understood! I guess it's just a Boeing thing!>>><<<Boeing likes to do their own thing. Which I hate...but it is what it is. ;)>>><<<On selecting it, the active setting will have a bold box around it for I think 10 seconds and will then go to this version.

To be honest there are so strict procedures around altimeter settings with the aircraft also aware which setting (QNH/Altimeter or STD) it should be on the odds of being incorrectly set are slim and if one of you miss-set it the aircraft will rather promptly inform you of a Baro Disagreement.>>><<<And in fact, you can see the baro knob on the bottom left there, and if you look closely the center of the knob says STD and is actually the toggle button mentioned in last comment.>>><<<Here is cluttered.

I feel like that has the minimum amount of information that I'd want without having to look down.>>><<<I have flown lots of other HUD systems, specifically Gulfstream and this feels cluttered and clunky. Gulfstream does a better job of presenting the data but yes, it’s all there.>>><<<What's funny is that the Gulfstream and Boeing HUDs are produced by the same supplier.  Blame the OEM specs.  :-)>>><<<We make more than just Boeing and Gulfstream too>>><<<Funny you say that, I like this presentation much better than the GAC EVS-II round dials.

I always imagine behind most screens there’s plenty of wiring, so idk what communicates to individual pixels (?) that they need to light up here.>>><<<It’s cast onto a special piece of glass by a projector above your head.>>><<<Ah, that makes more sense. Thanks.>>><<<It's a neat thing and special glass.  In a way a fancy projector.

Special part is how it bounces back to the eyeball.  It's focused at infinity - the eye can read the numbers while keeping focused on the horizon because as far as the eye is concerned the numbers are on the horizon miles away.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Oh wow, I didn’t realize that. I’ll need to do some digging into how wiring that is only at the edges of the screen can communicate with things in the middle of the screen.>>><<<Dear diary, today OP was cool>>><<<Do you find yourself becoming too dependent on the fpv, especially during landings? When I starting simming, I used it and now I can't stop>>><<<No. The FPV disappears around 80 feet and forces us to hand fly unless it’s on autoland. It doesn’t provide a flare cue either, unlike some other systems.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Once per month as required by maintenance.

My first flight on a 787 was an overnight to London and I got my eyes blasted by the sun and the window tint couldn't block all of it. Some things are best left unchanged IMO.>>><<<Is the airspeed tape on the left in m/s? If so, why use that instead of knots?>>><<<No. That’s knots. Actual Mach speed is noted at bottom, while desired is above the tape.>>><<<250 m/s roughly equals 480kts. I’d wager a guess and say that’d be far too fast on the 787.>>><<<It would under all circumstances. And 480kts indicated would be well over Mach 1 at 41,000 (about 950kts true air speed) 
So yeah. It’s knots indicated.>>><<<Knots _indicated_! Makes so much more sense now. True would be much higher. Duh. Right.>>><<<I’m assuming you’re not in US airspace yet. I’ve never actually considered the RVSM rules in other countries/transoceanic or if it exists.  Is Mach number unrestricted below 1.0?>>><<<Depends where you are. Most places you just fly what you filed.>>><<<That’s pretty sweet. Who do you fly for?>>><<<United, it says the flight number is UAL870 on the bottom right of the photo.>>><<<So can somebody explain why the Mach number is so high with them only going ~250 knots?>>><<<They're going 250 knots indicated, not 250 knots true airspeed, so you need to correct for the change in density at higher altitudes to get from KIAS to KTAS.
Also, the speed of sound depends on temperature and the adiabatic index, and you can imagine it gets much colder up at FL410, so the speed of sound is much lower.
Therefore, they can achieve transonic Mach numbers without a high KIAS value.>>><<<Yes. It’s called true airspeed. You can look it up.>>><<<So qwispy!>>><<<Is this Qantas or United?

Nice photo.>>><<<Wow! This is pretty cool. The coloring looks surreal.>>><<<Wow, this is awesome!>>><<<What's the use of this device??>>><<<Allows you to have all the information available while also keeping your eyes outside the cockpit, it stops you from getting fixated looking down at the normal displays.  I will say it's probably more useful in fighter jets and bush planes but I'm not a pilot so I don't know, it (should) cost not much more that a regular display and if you don't want to use it you probably don't have to.>>><<<Ohh i see thanks:)>>><<<In military aircraft your targeting reticle will show up in it and other info required to aim weapons.>>><<<This is awesome.>>><<<Thank you>>><<<How do you feel about the FPV I've used it on the 777 and I personally hate it.>>><<<I love it. it’s a must have on the HUD.

Can you clarify? Generally speaking we transition back to indicated airspeed out of 30k feet. So I’m not sure.>>><<<I sequence a bunch of 787s into Doha between cruise and FL220. We have mode S and can see you doing .85 or so up at 410/430. If I really need to slow you down up there before you descend, how slow can you go? I generally pull 
81 out of my ass but if you can come back to .79 that would be great to know.>>><<<Let me look it up....standby.>>><<<So we don’t have a chart for that...but look at the airspeed tape. The bottom block is at 217 and that is the min speed that keeps us out of the caution range (where we are too slow) and that equates to Mach .74 which is slow. It would be perfectly safe to request .77 or faster at FL410 and this safe window gets MUCH slower as we descend in terms of Mach. At FL300 I show a min Mach of .60 or 220 indicated in a clean config. 
So to answer your question, .77 or faster (up to .85) is totally reasonable!>>><<<Legend. Thanks for the effort. Appreciate the professional input.>>><<<What does the circle do>>><<<At the bottom?

Are you sure?

Are you *really* sure?

Fine, but you’ve not seen the last of me!!!>>><<<If it is flight control related then a pitch trim issue is likely.  Trim settings can suddenly disengage in certain circumstances or unexpectedly stay on.  This lead to a [passenger fatality on a Challenger 300 recently](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/ntsb-releases-report-on-flight-diverted-to-bradley-after-woman-suffered-fatal-medical-emergency/3000926/).  It was initially reported as turbulence but the preliminary report ruled out that possibility.>>><<<Well that is terrifying>>><<<Right?? I’m glad I keep my seatbelt on all the time.>>><<<Couldn't that also be a result of turbulence, either from the sudden g-forces loosening some battery connector or autopilot's reaction causing a system glitch/shutdown?>>><<<That’s two random and very ver uncommon events happening for that to take place. Is it possible, technically. Is it plausible, no not really.>>><<<How the hell does something like that happen? Has that ever happened before??>>><<<It’s complete speculation but I’ve flown planes where a similar malfunction can occur. The autopilot is on, then the servos manipulating the flight controls and/or trim detects a binding in the controls, and the aircraft trim system isn’t properly set anymore, and you get a caution message. The checklist then says “disconnect the autopilot and be ready for strong control forces”, and sure enough when the autopilot comes off you can get a sharp climb or descent because the plane isn’t trimmed for level flight, in this case it might have excessive nose down trim or not enough nose up trim, and then you’re bouncing passengers off the ceiling. IIRC this is what killed a private jet passenger on the east coast about a year ago.

It’s another great reason to keep your seatbelt on at all times>>><<<In this case they've been saying the controls went completely black>>><<<Fat captain bumps yoke trying to get to Lav before brown light turns into fire bottle release.>>><<<Cosmic ray? It supposedly happened to Qantas flight 72.>>><<<Flight attendants have a far riskier job than people realize.  Unless I have to use the restroom (which intentional around on any flight less than 4-5 hours) I always wear that seatbelt.>>><<<Funny story:  Many years ago when I was in the military, I was on a commercial flight to Dallas with a Lt. Col. to get some simulator training. The flight attendants were going around serving drinks when we hit a little turbulence.  He told the flight attendant that he was used to that stuff since he was a military pilot.  The flight attendant quickly responded "So, you're strapped in. We have to do this standing up.">>><<<“Which intentional around” means what?>>><<<Ugh I meant which I intentionally plan around…. (Fancy way of saying I go before the flight so I don’t have to get up)

Typing on a phone sorry>>><<<So many times the seatbelt sign goes off 10 minutes into the flight and the restroom line starts. Some of ‘em with just socks on their feet. 
SMDH!>>><<<Those lounge beers do not have a long shelf life in my bladder>>><<<I flew BER-EDI on Saturday and within about two minutes of the seatbelt sign going off there was a queue of 4 people for the rear toilet. Also someone who tried using the front one when the captain announced 10 minutes to landing with the signs on, on a 2 hour flight FFS..>>><<<I had a flight delayed by 2 &amp; a half hours and stupidly didn't go for a piss before takeoff. Soon as the seatbelt light clicked off I was down the aisle and at the rear lav so quickly the attendant hadn't even unlocked it yet. We both had a chuckle before I hightailed it inside and drained the tank.>>><<<i mean...this never happens>>><<<Yeah — super risky in 0.0001% of cases, so like a lot safer than any construction or manual labour activity. The biggest danger in their line of work is disgruntled passengers, transport to and from the airport and elevated risk of cancer due to higher radiation exposure.>>><<<And the worst thing, is that they have to risk their lives for 90% of the time being forced trying to sell you every kind of shit you could buy literally 30 minutes before boarding or 15 minutes after landing>>><<<Idk who the hell can knowingly hold it 4-5 hours. Anything over 90 minutes I'll happily pop back so I don't have to make a stop on the way to baggage claim>>><<<This reminds me of the book “Airframe” by Michael Chrichton.>>><<<Good book!  Ultimately we did give China the wing!>>><<<I loved it… though I’m sure there were some technical issues with the details. Accidental slats deployment sounds like a violent experience. (Edit: I'm an idiot - slats deployment did nothing. Thanks u/purgance for the correction)>>><<<...No.  That was the whole point of the book.  Slat deployment at cruising speed/altitude is at worst a mild change in attitude; the pilot literally flew the plane out of a safe operating envelope because he didn't understand how the plane was designed to operate.

It's the opposite of Boeing - instead of relying on pilots to perform herculean feats of insight and strength to save the plane from crashing itself, the plane in the book was designed to keep the pilots alive in almost any circumstance ... which is why the pilot had to disable the autopilot first in order to manually cause the accident.  The plane was even designed to automatically save the pilot when he stopped giving faulty control inputs.>>><<<You're absolutely right. It's been awhile since I read it. Apologies and thanks for the correction.>>><<<It's pretty obvious that Norton is meant to be McDonell Douglas. Which, of course, bought Boeing with Boeing's own money.>>><<<Yes, and the book does a very good job of dissecting the McDonnell Douglas is inept meme as compared with Boeing.  That John Oliver piece was ridiculous - Boeing has *always* been a profit first company - the Boeing that designed the MAX *is* the Boeing that bought MD.  Boeing didn't have any problems after the MD acquisition that it didn't have before, their current troubles are caused by the anti-union/anti-worker Wall Street pandering, not because they got MD food poisoning.  MD built great airplanes for their era, and Boeing has, too.  But the problem Boeing has now is that its profit emphasis is making its aircraft demonstrably less safe than the competition, which they can't hide from because the European regulators won't cover for Boeing like the FAA will.>>><<<Look up Fray Bentos accident, a Slat deployment at cruising altitude can be catastrophic.>>><<<Well, two things:  

1.  My comment is about the aircraft in the book; which relates the tale of an Airbus-like airplane with modern safety systems.  In that plane, slat extension is not a hazard - and that is the thesis of the book.  
2.  The accident you reference ([Austral 2553](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austral_L%C3%ADneas_A%C3%A9reas_Flight_2553)) is not caused by slat extension; it was caused by sensor malfunction (bad speed readings) and the FO's failure to follow instructions from the pilot (CRM).  The slat deployment was a part of the chain that led to the crash, but without the preceding events slat deployment would not have led to the crash (ie, the pilots would not have extended the slats without the erroneous airspeed indication).>>><<<1. Fair, I was just pointing out that Slat deployment at cruise altitude is no joke.

2. That makes no sense, that's like saying both MAX accidents were cause by a AoA vane problem and not a poorly designed system.  
In the AU2553, what started the chain was a airspeed error, but what sealed their fate was slat extention.>>><<<In my opinion, the issue with this analysis is that any part of the airframe could've failed in an overspeed condition - not just the slats.  If the pilot deployed the thrust reversers or landing gear at cruising speed and they failed catastrophically would we say that the thrust reversers caused the accident?

The investigation report is in Spanish, but ASN has a [translation](https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19971010-0) that doesn't appear to say "the slats caused the accident" but rather that flight envelope the pilots put the plane into in response to the bad airspeed sensor was the cause of the accident.  

The distinction between this incident and the MAX is that the MAX didn't experience any airframe failures of any kind - the plane was intact and airworthy, the avionics system just commanded it to fly into the ground.>>><<<TWA841 was brought up in this sub recently and had some pretty decent similarities. Somehow slats deployed, one got stuck, put the plane into a spiral dive. Pilots say they didn't do anything wrong, simulations after all seemed to be decently controllable according to the final report IIRC.>>><<<Great book. Peak Crichton.>>><<<What kind of technical issue would cause this? Isn’t this kind of thing usually caused by clear air turbulence?>>><<<A Qantas Airbus A330 had this happen a while back. QF 72 if you want to read up on it. There they had corrupted software and the plane commanded pitch down suddenly while in cruise. 

From the Wiki on QF 72:

&gt; After detailed forensic analysis of the FDR, the FCPC software, and the ADIRU, the CPU of the ADIRU was found to have corrupted the AOA data. The exact nature of the corruption was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude at the time of the incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625°. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the high-AOA protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system to pitch the nose down.

787 has been in service long enough now that maybe a software issue pops up once. Would sort of track with the other comments/rumors that the flight deck went dark for a bit.

Another possibility is the 787 has to be fully turned off and rebooted after 51 days to prevent misleading data from being shown to pilots. One of the potential complications form that is the network switches inside the plane can crash. 

https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/

Wild speculation alert: maybe that wasn’t done and bad data was fed into the computer / or the internal network was reset mid flight.>>><<<Not really corrupted software. They had buggy software. QF 72 encountered a very rare corner case that was not handled by the software, and as a result nosedived the airplane.>>><<<Or the pilot knocked the yoke forward and tried covering it up. Not saying 787 is perfect , but it performs enough tests on itself during startup that something like this would’ve notified either maintenance or the flight crew. 

Will be very interested to read the report once it’s released>>><<<I love that I keep seeing articles about the company/startup that is trying to be the first that has AI flying a plane. Let’s get rid of the pilots and trust everything to code.>>><<<Seems like CAT, can't find any source that says anything else than "technical problem" but what kind of technical problem causes a sudden, short drop in altitude? The airplane was going at cruise speed when this happened. The only thing that may cause this that's not weather/climate related is vertical stabilizer failure right? Which seems pretty scary, so hopefully it was just CAT and media is overreacting.

One article said this:

&gt;It is not yet known what caused the "technical problem" on the flight to Auckland.

&gt;In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration last week reported an issue with Boeing Dreamliners' de-icing systems, according to CNN.

&gt;The administration said a damaged seal could impact an engine inlet, risking serious damage to the plane.>>><<<There's an [article](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/350209071/sydney-auckland-flight-drops-suddenly-50-passengers-and-crew-injured) with a quote from a passenger who said he asked the pilot what happened, and the pilot responded saying "my gauges just blanked out, I lost all of my ability to fly the plane".  


 At first I thought it must've just been CAT, but if there's any truth to that quote, it sounds like it could be something much more serious. An interesting observation from a passenger is that it seemed more people were injured towards the back of the plane, double compared to those in the middle. Could that indicate an uncommanded pitch manoeuvre?    


 Really interested to see what comes of this. I fly on Dreamliners between Australia and NZ somewhat regularly, so this could be concerning if it's a genuine fault in the aircraft.>>><<<Highly unusual for flight crew to reveal that to a passenger>>><<<I can confirm that the pilot was conversing with passengers, and not in a "ladies and gentlemen please stay calm" way. Unfortunately the conversation I witnessed was in Spanish, which I do not speak.>>><<<Also unusual for an aircraft to get rocked so hard 50 people sustain injuries with a dozen hospitalized>>><<<Someone who says they were on it said the captain did a walkthrough of the cabin, which is already highly unusual .>>><<<Well, dives and 50 injuries on a flight are also highly unusual, it might be a rarely used protocol, or maybe the pilot was just being empathetic to the situation>>><<<When they were landed and medical staff was helping the injured, not unlikely by any means after all his in charged>>><<<This passenger was just on CNN live 45 minutes ago and repeated this statement. He said the pilot had come back to see how people were doing, that he (the pilot) "looked like he was in shock" and when the passenger asked what happened, he said the pilot stated his gauges went blank and during that time, he was unable to control the plane.>>><<<Yeah, I'm also concerned by this reported statement. The airline itself has also said it was a technical issue. It doesn't sound like turbulence. I'm really surprised that there is not more discussion about this aspect of the incident, because if it's correct it's going to be a serious issue for 787 operators.

I'm flying on an Air NZ 787 on Sunday. I'm going to be honest here, despite my involvement in aviation for much of my life, I have never really felt comfortable on a 787. Whenever I fly between NZ and the US (4 to 5 times per annum), I book to fly on the 777 everytime. 

I know that the 787 is efficient and comfortable, but given the choice I avoid it. Sadly, Air NZ don't operate the 777 to Honolulu.>>><<<Yeah and the flight tracking data went blank after the event happened and then came back around descent and landing. So something technical definitely happened it seems.>>><<<Could be a Quantas flight 72 kinda issue caused by a software/fly by wire glitch>>><<<That incident was probably caused by a subatomic particle flipping a bit in a memory word which happened to store air speed. Quite crazy.

Edit: or the memory word was storing angle of attack, can't remeber for sure.>>><<<Which is why aviation critical computers are dual channel and error checked…you can’t get them to do anything with a single bit flip.>>><<<Ecc memory can correct a single bit automatically or detect double bit errors.>>><<<Unless it's a Boeing, in which case a [single point of failure is totally fine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System)>>><<<Wow. One bit. That's quite a redundancy there.>>><<<Hate to ask, could someone please define "CAT"?

Edit; Clear Air Turbulence>>><<<It's like a dog just smaller and meows.>>><<<Unless you’re Kevin of Reddit lore>>><<<Clear Air Turbulence>>><<<Clear Air Turbulence>>><<<It’s “clear-air turbulence”, basically just turbulence when there’s no storm/other indication.>>><<<I had to [look it up](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_00-30C.pdf) also. CAT is "Clear Air Turbulence."

&gt; CAT is defined as “sudden severe turbulence occurring in cloudless regions that causes violent buffeting of aircraft.” This term is commonly applied to higher altitude turbulence associated with wind shear. The most comprehensive definition is high-altitude
turbulence encountered outside of convective clouds. This includes turbulence in cirrus clouds, within and in the vicinity of standing lenticular clouds and, in some cases, in clear air in the vicinity of thunderstorms. Generally, though, CAT definitions exclude
turbulence caused by thunderstorms, low-altitude temperature inversions, thermals, strong surface winds, or local terrain features.>>><<<Clean Air Turbulence, a sudden and usually severe turbulence without any clouds causing it.>>><<<*Clear Air Turbulence*  
  
I CONTRIBUTED!>>><<<It's a creature that broadcasts its vocalizations on 121.5 MHz in the United States.>>><<<&gt;Seems like CAT

I can confirm, cat walked across the plane's control panel causing the incident>>><<<Hmmmmmm I’d doubt this has anything to do with engines. Even a total power failure wouldn’t cause the plane to simply *fall* for several seconds.>>><<<Reports of the instrument panel going dark, more injuries at the rear of the plane and possibly the loss of altitude caused by the elevators pitching it down. It makes no sense to me that power going out would cause a dive, it should keep flying fairly level right?>>><<<A software error could do all sorts of strange things and it sounds like in this case it caused the computer to send commands to pitch up or down.

Now I’m not saying this is usual at all, redundancies are supposed to be in place to prevent this from happening. If computer A sends gibberish, the fact that computer B is not saying pitch should result in the aircraft staying level and sending warnings to the cockpit.

This is why it would be VERY concerning if a software issue put the aircraft in an unsafe condition.>>><<<A Boeing software error crashed two planes killing over 300 people.

There's precedent.>>><<<Wasn't it not so much a software issue as a systems engineering issue? IIRC, the software did what it was supposed to, it's just that that thing was not well thought through.>>><<<Exactly, it was a feature, not a bug. Just the wrong kind of feature for those on board.>>><<<I know you're being sarcastic, it was not a feature, it was bad systems engineering. The software did what it was supposed to do; the systems integration failed.>>><<<Someone wrote the requirements that when plane does xxx, do xnxx. There’s much more to it, of course, but that is the jist of it.>>><<<Right, I thought the real issue was that the “do xnxx” part was not adequately conveyed to all customers’ and their pilots.>>><<<And lack of training.  They wanted to tell their customers they could save training dollars…>>><<<Can someone with direct knowledge/experience comment on whether something like has been reported can be accomplished with just control surfaces? Or would it require at least partially an atmospheric phenomenon?>>><<<If you ignore/disable flight envelope protections you could easily do this kind of thing with the controls accesible to the pilots.>>><<<It can happen when there are issues between pitch trim settings and elevator position inputs.  Modern aircraft stabilizers have two ways to control pitch.

Pitch trim is for more long term adjustment.  If the plane is flying too nose high or low you can adjust pitch trim with usually a trim wheel control that will maintain that setting long term.

The other pitch control is short term flight control inputs from a pilot or autopilot.

Pitch trim setting and elevator position can either counteract the inputs of the other or compound the inputs of the other.  Pilot error, computer error or mechanical failure can cause a pitch trim and elevator position combination that suddenly deviates from level flight.>>><<<Just wear the damn seat belt people>>><<<This.  I don't give a shit if you get injured flying about the cabin, but you're going to injure people who are doing the right thing and wearing their seatbelt, and that makes you an arsehole.

/obvious exceptions if you were on your way to or from the toilet, or one of the cabin crew>>><<<Oh man I didn’t consider someone might be in the lav when this happened…


Now is it still considered a “Poseidon’s kiss” at FL300+?>>><<<Considering how violent it sounds it would definitely wouldn't be a kiss.

My friend had just gone to the bathroom, and he came back with a small cut on his head having been flung into the wall mid-stream, so to speak.>>><<<And wet stains on his trousers?>>><<<While i do agree with you that if you're sitting down you should be wearing your seatbelt as a general rule, it should be noted that the seatbelt sign was turned off at the time of the incident, and there was no turbulence prior to the event that would indicate something was about to occur. 

You can't blame the people for moving around the cabin at that time.>>><<<I’ve learned as an adult that many people don’t understand basic physics. Yes the seatbelt sign is off but you should still wear it>>><<<People are just stupid. I was on a flight last week and while we were on our final landing approach a lady hopped out of her seat and tried to run back and use the bathroom.  At like 400ft when I could see the airfield out my window.>>><<<When ya gotta go, ya gotta go.>>><<<Maybe she was about to shit her pants and couldn't hold it any longer. I'm not gonna judge someone desperately running to a bathroom. >>><<<Having her get to the toilet would be a lot better than that lady who shat all down the aisle that caused the flight to divert.>>><<<People are bad at reasoning about dangerous, but low probability scenarios.

On 999 out of 1000 flights, there isn’t extreme turbulence. But on that 1000th flight, there is, and you might die without your seatbelt.

Our primate brains have a tendency to look at patterns and conclude “on 999 flights, things are fine so I don’t need my seatbelt”, and we don’t consider how bad things can get in low probabilities events.>>><<<This applies to flying in general. Flying is statistically safe but inevitably, fringe scenarios occur and some cannot be salvaged>>><<<When my wife was pregnant, the OBGYN was trying to explain the risks of a natural birth. Small but statistically worth considering. Like 1 in 500. She was 38, possible placenta previa.

My arrogant brain thought "well that's a tiny risk". Doc says, "Ozlander, you travel a lot for your job, right? (Yeah about 100k miles pa) 

"So here's the question. Heathrow handles a minimum 500 flights a day. On one specific day, you know a plane will definitely crash. Do you fly that day or choose another?"

I know this is a reverse analogy to aviation statistics but it really helped me grasp probability, plus reminded me how safe aviation is. (And my son was was born safely too!)>>><<<I work in security and spend a huge chunk of my day doing risk analysis. It’s one of those things that human brains are simply are not good at, which is why distilling things down to numbers works so much better than our intuition. Otherwise it’s easy to spend a lot of time and money trying to solve the wrong problems.

Glad to hear your son was born safely.  :)>>><<<This. 

A little choppy on the takeoff climb and captain doesn’t turn off the light? Wear your seatbelt. 

Beautiful clear day, smooth as glass flight, light is off? Doesn’t matter, wear your seatbelt when not going to the bathroom. 

I’ve been in clear air turbulence, thankfully it was mild but shocking to the people who weren’t wearing their seatbelt.

Can’t tell you how annoyed I was at seeing parents letting their young kid take off the seatbelt right after takeoff (and when we were still in the initial climb out no less) the last time I flew! If your ass in in the seat, the belt goes around your waist!>>><<<Man as a parent with young kids who flys regularly, wish it was that easy. Sometimes you have to pick and choose your battles. I keep them mostly buckled in but sometimes you have to let them loose. And yes I’m a professional pilot, I know the risks.>>><<<Sounds like Qantas 72, except with a 787 instead of an a330>>><<<People are going to start refusing to fly on Boeing airplanes.>>><<<You're getting down voted but you're right. A number of issues with Boeing aircraft (some unrelated) and the FAA investigation into Boeing determining their safety is basically non-existent isn't good press. It took about as much bad press to effectively ruin MD. Which then turned into the Boeing shit show we know today.>>><<<I mean I always had positive feelings about Boeing up until very recently. I don’t know how you couldn’t question them after all the recent press.>>><<<Much of that recent press is clickbait, though, selected and published specifically so that news outlets can put a Boeing hashtag in the post and drive engagement. Pilot error and maintenance are the lead suspects for the recent United Airlines issues, for example. If you look at a full incident report you’ll see several Airbus aircraft over the last few days/weeks that have suffered engine failures, hydraulic failures, smoke in the cockpit, severe turbulence, a tail strike, faulty door indicators.

An A330 had a very similar issue to this incident just a couple months ago that injured 70 passengers and everyone forgot about it after a few days. If it were a Boeing they’d likely still be talking about it.>>><<<I already agreed with you, but agree even more now that a [Boeing whistleblower was found dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) after not showing up for his deposition.

Solar flare caused a single event upset.>>><<<Very possible. Earth's magnetic south pole is near southern Australia and its a known environment for cosmic ray hits. My PhD project was a balloon-borne telescope that flew from New Zealand and we noticed several more hits while over that region. I wouldn't discount a bitflip or some magnetic activity. It could have either caused the controls to blank out, so autopilot disengaged, and if the trim is set to nose-down then cause an abrupt change, or it could have caused uncontrolled maneuvres.>>><<<Boeing has fucked their reputation so hard that it doesn't matter whether or not this is their fault.

Whenever I fly, my personal observance is that most everybody keeps their seatbelt on, because most everybody has read/seen stories of people flying about the plane because of unexpected turbulence and/or sudden plane maneuvers. Just seems dumb to not wear it.>>><<<Agreed and once you've felt the effects of anything beyond mild turbulence, which anyone who flies a lot probably has, you respect it. I've been thrown while in line for the lav, and having the surface you're standing on vanish from beneath your feet in a second will rattle you with a quickness.>>><<<Recently had a pretty wild flight (SLC-ABQ). Buckled in tight, but also holding on to the arm-rests - but they no longer stay locked down, so that's pretty useless these days.>>><<<The point of the seatbelt off sign is to allow you to use the restroom or quicky get something out of a bin. You really should have your seatbelt on at all times unless you are getting out of the seat temporarily. It's not meant for you to slop it off and sit there the whole flight like a moron.>>><<<And it’s not mandatory because accidents like these are freakish. Which a lot of these commenters are forgetting. 

Imagine someone slipped on a banana peel one day and cracked their skull on the sidewalk. Should we all then be required to wear a helmet when we walk down the street?>>><<<Here's the link to the previous thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1bbvgk5/emergency_services_rush_to_auckland_airport_after/

Either way all good.>>><<<Holy shit. Uncommanded sudden drop in altitude?! Waiting for more information.>>><<<I’ll try to avoid Boeing line the plague in the future>>><<<Not a lot of details concerning *what* happened yet, but it SOUNDS (and I’m absolutely no expert) like it was less a technical issue and more like a freak pocket of extreme air pressure change. 

Planes don’t just *fall* out of the sky unless they lose their wings. The way passengers are describing it, it’s like they were suddenly just free falling.

Or maybe the plane suddenly pitched down dramatically? Is this another MCAS issue (which I thought was just on the 737 max)? You don’t necessarily have to be falling in order to experience zero / reverse G’s in the cabin; any big downward change in pitch in an airplane can cause that sensation, even if you’re still in a climb.>>><<<Go resd the report from other posts. Seems like the plane had a technical malfunction and the pilots corrected it. That's why they were so visibly shaken.>>><<<I've been on the same flight last year but the other way round from Auckland to Sydney. It was quite comfortable. Crazy to see that this happened on the same plane>>><<<Can you imagine that those passengers have to take another flight from NZ to SCL, a flight of +10hrs, +10hr FLYING ALONE OVER THE OCEAN, with nothing nearby, only Antarctica on one side!!!!>>><<<Looks like they had zero turbulence other than the sudden movement.>>><<<Puts on Boeing...again>>><<<Turbulence is not a “technical problem”. Which one is it?>>><<<What I'm getting from all of these reports is "do not fly Boeing">>><<<https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/s/DGGjsc3aJ2>>><<<Did the flight get into the Coffin Corner?>>><<<People keep telling me that the recent string of commercial (well, and private) SNAFUs are all par the course and simply an example of reporting bias etc.

Is that still the case? I don’t remember seeing this frequency of such news say ten years ago. Is this truly just false perception?

P.S. Save the righteous rhetoric, I am not publishing a paper asserting anything, but asking a (perhaps rare) honest question and hoping for an honest response from more informed people than myself.>>><<<rough start for boeing this year ;((>>><<<I’m interested in this. I was on a 787 flight from Chicago to Paris where a similar sounding thing albeit much less severe occurred. Flight attendant got injured and the pilot went back to Chicago. Heard nothing about the cause or any other injuries. 

Came out of nowhere. Pilot quickly yelped through the loudspeaker “flight attendants take your seats!” Then two consecutive dips that lasted a few seconds each. Then not a bump the whole way back to Chicago. 

Im almost certain it was just random turbulence.
