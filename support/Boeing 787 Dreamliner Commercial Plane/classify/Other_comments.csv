the last twenty or so years i have not looked forward to flying any sort of distance recently took a flight from seattle to tokyo on ana 787 dream liner it was a ten hour flight of pure joy the aircraft was absolutely beautiful the clean lines the beautiful interior along with individual tv monitors that pull out from the arm rests i was lucky enough to have an exit seat so i had plenty of leg room the service was excellent with full course meals served at no extra cost oh and the flight attendants japanese ladies were beautiful and very friendly i swear not a one over the age of thirty probably my most enjoyable flight i have ever experienced the 787 is an absolutely gorgeous airplane both inside and out my return trip was on a united 747 that was probably thirty or so years old it was dirty it smelled and i am sure the stewardess were at least forty fifty plus with attitudes the meal was a piece of dried chicken back to reality on why i was not looking forward to the flight to begin with if you get a chance to fly on the dream liner i am sure you will be all smiles at least if it is with japan airlines ana ,Other,YouTube

the take off alone is simply amazing i love airplanes always have always will since a child i am amazed and fascinated by them ,Other,YouTube
these planes have a lot more power than people think climb rates roll and turn rate are restricted in most flight for passenger comfort not aircraft ability anyone who has ever flown into sky harbor phoenix or the old stapleton airport in denver when the wind was blowing from the wrong direction know these plains are capable of a high higher climb rate than you normally see on a commercial flight these plains are made to carry immense weights so taking off empty is like taking the engine our of a 1 ton truck and mounting it on a dune buggy regardless these are incredible aircraft ,Other,YouTube

sigh  where are the rails that should be in the floor for all of the seats then ,Other,Reddit
here is when i piped in on this a few years back someone else had the same question there is also the same top comment  edit you might not click that the seats do not start til aft of door 3 behind that wall in the middle of the isle at the next set of doors they are covered up by the carpet forward of that ,Other,Reddit
do people think the carpet is supposed to go in after the seats i do not understand how the lack of seat rails would suggest the plane is not real ,Other,Reddit
they are all smart enough to know the seat rails have to be there because it is part of the planes structure but can not fathom those rails are just under the carpet,Other,Reddit

this reminds me of the story told me by my former father in law who is a 777 pilot for delta he was asked to pick up one of the new planes from boeing field and bring it back to atlanta he and the copilot brought their wives with with them the inside was like this with no seats and the ladies were to sit in the jump seats during takeoff the guys are jacked they had no load and requested to do an unrestricted takeoff and we are given permission to do so my mother in law had strapped her self in as they taxied but the copilot is wife kept farting around exploring while they taxied to the runway well the guys did not announce that they were getting ready to takeoff and she was still standing my mil said that this woman went ass over tea kettle in her skirt the complete length of the plane till she hit the bulkhead at the back she said she never laughed so hard in her life the other woman got up quite indignant and stomped her way up to the front of the plane to yell at the two men it is always such a visual story that anytime i see a picture like this that is all i can picture is this 50 year old woman rolling with her skirt over her head down the whole length ,Other,Reddit
i worked on it it is not a mock up i give a little chuckle every time i see this post and the resulting it is just a model comments it is a real 787 9 on the factory flight line in south carolina again i worked on it you can see the flight line outside through the darkened windows just aft of the exit doors there is a non potatoe version of the pic further down in the comments but the middle baggage bins do not start till door 3 you are looking at doors 2 i watched a qa hit his head on the back of that fasten seat belt sign and it had to be replaced it was going to a private buyer who was going to gut it anyway so there was basically no interior felt big enough to play a soccer game inside edit apparently i should include this link confirming that business jets were indeed delivered like this and using this same pic from 2014 ,Other,Reddit
