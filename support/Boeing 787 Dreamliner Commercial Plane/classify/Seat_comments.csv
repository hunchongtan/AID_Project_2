all airframe no systems too bad missed the majority of it i know ,Seat,YouTube
nice demonstration did not think a plane like that could pull a maneuver like that going almost vertical from take off now let is see how it handles when the plane is full of fuel people and luggage ,Seat,YouTube
its amazing how much technology has achieved this is unbelievable,Seat,YouTube
loved it,Seat,YouTube
fantastic video,Seat,YouTube
who does not dream to be at a high altitude in a metal full of kerosen that explodes and burns like a crisp if easily damaged lt 3 ,Seat,YouTube
love this channel and really respect your knowledge but  there is no such thing as a negative balance sheet i think you meant negative income statement not quite right or negative net income ,Seat,YouTube
you want to impress me i want to see some sane engineering ,Seat,YouTube
this is epic ,Seat,YouTube
primary method a human relieves stomach gas is burping not fa ing unless you have had a fundoplication so to avoid fa ing i would avoid that procedure and if you are a candidate go for the linx placement and burp when needed like normal linx for gerd has been in use since 2012 ,Seat,YouTube
grace personified ,Seat,YouTube
now i want to see it do this loaded with passengers and luggage ,Seat,YouTube
you means the airplane with intrinsic technical problems no thank you i stick with airbus when possible us talk arrogance boeing learned from airbus,Seat,YouTube
this is mad ,Seat,YouTube
i mean it was big but most of the distortion is probably coming from the shape of the taxiway intersection,Seat,Reddit
always like seeing this video here it is so cool,Seat,Reddit

chemtrails ,Seat,Reddit
no hull losses is what he means ,Seat,Reddit
fatigue would still be a problem even if the motion was minimal it is more about cyclic loading than displacement the structure can and is designed to be able to withstand many cycles without failing due to fatigue enough to survive the aircraft is entire life ,Seat,Reddit

yes ,Seat,Reddit
i am an airline guy and i also own an airplane one of the first things i did was remove the stupid whiskey compass for a vertical compass card so much nicer and if something breaks i can at least use it for real granted i only have one primary hsi in my plane where everything in the airline world has at least two ,Seat,Reddit
i had a flight delayed by 2 amp a half hours and stupidly did not go for a piss before takeoff soon as the seatbelt light clicked off i was down the aisle and at the rear lav so quickly the attendant had not even unlocked it yet we both had a chuckle before i hightailed it inside and drained the tank ,Seat,Reddit
higher altitude would mean lower pressure so yes it would still evaporate ,Seat,Reddit
chasing an airframe is one of the worst career moves you can make in aviation ,Seat,Reddit
i have always wondered how comfortable are pilots seats can any pilot here answer thank you ,Seat,Reddit
my company writes the software that does this sort of simulation modelling but for a different industry the compute power and time required to accurately simulate different conditions is immense like we run our models on not just one server but clusters of super high performance servers that measure their ram in terabytes doing this in the 2000s would have been insane we are talking about resources probably costing hundreds of millions if not billions ,Seat,Reddit
 gt that is a pretty safe design it is not you need to lift the cover to move the seat backwards and just press the cover to move it forwards ,Seat,Reddit
enough with that fucking effect ,Seat,Reddit
the seat belts on an aircraft are not uncomfortable though you are already stuck there in a tiny seat it is not like the belt can really make that any worse ,Seat,Reddit
these aircraft were also built with massive safety factors with respect to fatigue not sure off the top of my head but iirc well above 100x safety factor above what was calculated not sure how much better it has gotten but certainly at the time fatigue of composites was very poorly understood ,Seat,Reddit
not a lot of details concerning what happened yet but it sounds and i am absolutely no expert like it was less a technical issue and more like a freak pocket of extreme air pressure change planes do not just fall out of the sky unless they lose their wings the way passengers are describing it it is like they were suddenly just free falling or maybe the plane suddenly pitched down dramatically is this another mcas issue which i thought was just on the 737 max you do not necessarily have to be falling in order to experience zero reverse g is in the cabin any big downward change in pitch in an airplane can cause that sensation even if you are still in a climb ,Seat,Reddit
 gt high speed stall  huh i had no idea this was a thing interesting and scary ,Seat,Reddit
it has been around 5 years since i last saw one so it is probably changed now ,Seat,Reddit
