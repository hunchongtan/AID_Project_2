the icarus my name for dreamliners will show its cracks over time pun intended though an amazing design and flying experience do not expect nearly the longevity of the 747 the first prototypes revealed serious inherent flaws which still exist today and only touched upon herein surrounding the fasteners corrosion as well as weakening caused by flying in extreme heat cold environments not the least pf which are differing thermal expansion rates where different materials come in contact one long time aerospace engineer i worked with at goodrich who was building boeing commercial airliners for decades and described the inflight 787 failures he expected including his depiction of a wing peeling apart when fasteners fail only the folks who build these amazing planes not merely reading the brochure or checking off spec sheets know these design flaws and their ultimate implications not long after his discussion i saw several of the early co is which addressed some of his concerns after the fact ,LABEL_0
