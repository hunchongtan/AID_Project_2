to be honest i really dislike the lack of control over the window brightness on the 787 dreamliner why can not the cabin crew allow passengers to see beautiful city lights in the middle of the night ,LABEL_0
cabin crew can take full control of all windows on 787 regardless of individual settings ,LABEL_1
