we are not close at all it is actually right there on the speed tape the max speed is denoted by the blocks up top that show around 280 or so and the low speed stall is not shown on bottom bc it is actually off the tape you do see the beginning of the caution band starting down there but actual stalk is really low bc this wing is just that good if i wanted to look it up i could tell you precisely but trust it is no where even close to where you would fly ,LABEL_2
