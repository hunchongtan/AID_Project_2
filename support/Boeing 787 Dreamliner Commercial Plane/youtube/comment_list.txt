Recently took a flight from Seattle to Tokyo on ANA 787 Dream liner. It was a ten hour flight of pure joy. The aircraft was absolutely beautiful. The clean lines, the beautiful interior along with individual TV monitors that  pull out from the arm rests.  I was lucky enough to have an exit seat so I had plenty of leg room. The service was excellent with full course meals served at no extra cost. Oh, and the flight attendants, Japanese ladies were beautiful and very friendly. I swear not a one over the age of thirty. Probably my most enjoyable flight I have ever experienced. The 787 is an absolutely gorgeous airplane both inside and out.<br><br>My return trip was on a United 747 that was probably thirty or so years old. It was dirty, it smelled and I&#39;m sure the stewardess were at least forty-fifty plus with attitudes. The meal was a piece of dried chicken. Back to reality on why I wasn&#39;t looking forward to the flight to begin with. <br><br>If you get a chance to fly on the dream liner I&#39;m sure you will be all smiles, at least if it is with Japan Airlines, &quot;ANA&quot;>>><<<Without music  please!>>><<<Payment of sickness bags exceeds revenue ...>>><<<This is a fake.>>><<<why was it not using the whole run way to take off , it was an extreme take off , guess you got some extreme seat belts in that sucker.>>><<<Magyar nƒóp mesƒók>>><<<take an airbus A380 any day !>>><<<This is why I live in Vietnam and I mostly visit the US>>><<<Again, why do they leave the APU running?>>><<<@boeing can my company please use this video for commercial use?

Climb rates, roll and turn rate are restricted in most flight for passenger comfort not aircraft ability. Anyone who has ever flown into Sky-harbor (Phoenix) or the Old Stapleton airport in Denver when the wind was blowing from the wrong direction know these plains are capable of a high higher climb rate than you normally see on a commercial flight.

These connections have been big problem for assembly. They placed aluminum inserts inside carbon fiber so you need to drill abrasive carbon first before you get to aluminum. You can do it on a few holes but not on thousands. Sections do not also fit well together. Another big problem is mechanical system, which is made out of steel: all the actuator for cargo doors, landing gears, high lift system, horizontal stabilizer trim actuator and pilot controls all made out of metal, not composite while these composite components are available from, for example, FRPGear Company in the USA and from some in EU. Only the exterior - the shell is composite while the most of the airplane is not.

I live in Moses Lake, WA where this airport is located. Those hangars you see in the footage are now Genie Industries where they make aerial platforms and cranes. The reason Boeing used Moses Lake for their test flights is that we have one of the longest runways (it used to be an emergency landing strip for the space shuttle) and because of low population density. As you can see it&#39;s mostly farmland and sagebrush out here. Oh yeah, the test flight was pretty cool too, shows what this aircraft is capable of.

These planes are flown in a much different manner when transporting passengers and freight. The normal &quot;everyday&quot; flight goal is a smooth and seamless operation with minimal flight correction. The 787-9 could do a &quot;barrel roll&quot; if you wanted it to, but for the safety of the crew and the people on the ground, it is prohibited!

It‚Äôs a sponsored video, and no one seems to have any independent footage of it.<br><br>¬† 2. It‚Äôs odd not to capture a profile shot of a truly near-vertical takeoff, because it would be a spectacularly impressive shot, and the shots were clearly planned.<br><br>¬† 3. The camera gives the runway an orthogonal look which really suggests it‚Äôs close to vertical, but you can fake this by zooming in from a distance, which is probably what happened, as I doubt they put an observation plane directly in the flight path at takeoff.<br><br>¬† 4. The framing cuts off the shadow as soon as it lifts off, which would tell us what angle it‚Äôs climbing at and is precisely the kind of reference you want in a shot like that to convey spatial relationships.<br><br>My hunch is that it‚Äôs a lot closer to 45 degrees, which I feel intuitively would still create a stall at that low speed, and that the quick correction saves the day.¬† In any event, definitely an insane maneuver.¬† Made me wonder what Vietnam Airlines was thinking as far as the promotional value is concerned: ‚ÄúWe&#39;re risk-takers.¬† Welcome aboard!‚Äù<br><br>I guess we‚Äôll find out soon enough at the Paris Air Show, when we start to see spectator video of this ‚Äúrehearsal‚Äù of the ‚Äúnear-vertical‚Äù takeoff that was ‚Äúcaught‚Äù on camera.>>><<<Anybody has the name of the song ?>>><<<The most expensive laxative there is.>>><<<Holy Hel I was going nope nope nope during that take off holy WOW>>><<<I was hoping for a barrel roll as was done in 1955 Seattle Air Show with Boeing 707.>>><<<Incredible video and performance of this ¬†beautiful bird.

Congrats with this magnificent pice of machinery.>>><<<What&#39;s up with the wings? They look so majestic!>>><<<The easiest way to go vertical (or nearly so) on takeoff is to get to rotate speed, pull back on the controls just enough to get the wheels off the ground and raise them. Stay low and build up speed while in ground effect, where induced drag is minimal, then pull back hard and zorch into the sky. ¬†What makes this video look more impressive is that they started the climb while the gear were extended, which is a crapload of drag on the plane. Seems they were at or near their maximum pitch before raising the gear. That is impressive. Gear down tricks usually are. When the Blue Angels used to fly A-4&#39;s and do an aileron roll on takeoff with the gear extended was an amazing thing to see. ¬†The camera angle doesn&#39;t allow us to see how long the takeoff roll was, though. Any plane can go nearly vertical for a short period of time if you roll down the runway far enough to build up max speed.¬†<br><br>I am impressed by the video, but would like to see this from a side angle before I&#39;m truly floored by its capability. That would show the roll distance before rotate and give a better idea of the actual pitch angle, which may have looked exaggerated by the overhead camera angle.>>><<<What a magnificent bird....so agile....wings swept back and arched...like a hawk in top speed dive mode..but at all times and with jet engines!!!!!>>><<<wow. i know she would push the envelope but i dint know the bobble was so big let alone know that she could feel the edges!!! good work guys, good work.>>><<<This adds a whole new meaning to VTOL.>>><<<How can they take this videos?>>><<<Hey guys im curious, whats the rpm for a cruising passenger jet aircraft and a helicopter?>>><<<If it aint Boeing, I aint going.<br>>>><<<Beautiful !>>><<<I know that steep takeoff wouldn&#39;t happen during commercial flights, but could you imagine if there was a time that it was merited and YOU were on board? &quot;Honey, I can&#39;t wait to see what the Bahamas lo...WHAT THE HELL?!&quot;>>><<<Suck it Airbus.>>><<<wow>>><<<How do they get away without having winglits?>>><<<Noisiest plane and narrowest business pitch I experienced.

The A380 is far superior in terms of comfort, leg room, quietness, smoothness, it allows airlines to deliver better service. 787 has uncomfortable seats, was noisy &amp; bumpy.

They were having some fitting troubles at the time. That&#39;s the one they rolled out for display on July 8, 2007 (7-8-07). I was working on the DreamLifter, the 747 that transported major components across two oceans. The 787 fuselage was made in Italy and flew in the DreamLifter out of Trattaglia. The wings came from Japan and were flown out of Nagoya. The DreamLifter major modifications were done by EGAT in Taipei, Taiwan. It was hot and humid there for sure.<br><br>Sorry but your description of deicing is incorrect in part. No airplane can deice its own wings on the ground as shown with the hot Type I fluid (most likely) being applied to the top of the wing surface. Ice is usually removed with hot Type I then another coat of Type IV fluid is applied if needed in really bad weather (it isn&#39;t always Type IV but this is an example). Type IV has non-Newtonian properties that help keep it on the wing until a certain airspeed is reached, after which it will flow away and off the wing. Leading edge anti-ice devices built into the airplane leading edges are only used in flight, as that is where ice accretes from impact of ice or supercooled water droplets suspended in the relative wind.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapFQl6RezA&amp;t=200">3:20</a> fun seeing parts i&#39;ve installed show up on a YT recommend video>>><<<As a pilot of 787.

The Boeing 737 does not have this body lift action and the structure would weaken the structure of the Boeing 737 and would eventually be responsible for accidents.

Largely dramatically lower costs per passenger per flight/ such that if it&#39;s flying only say 200-300 people or so, it still outcompetes things like the 787-777-767-737 and the Airbus a340-a320&#39;s (and probably some other AB options I&#39;m not as aware of). Meaning we are most likely to see &quot;super jumbos&quot; in the form of the blended wing form and likely those will come in seating options of 300-600 likely. Mostly because I think their will be a cargo use for something the size of a 600+ seat range, so they might as well design a passenger cabin for it too. But not test it till some company is seriously asking for it. So we might see some very busy routes with two of more flights at very similar times (say leaving within an hour of each other) condensed into one flight and plane.  But most of flights are now point to point, and no longer spoke and hub, so these massive planes would probably be reserved for long haul flights between huge population centers, say eastern US to Europe. In theory also the pilot shortage might imply a push towards largely planes and fewer flights, because there aren&#39;t enough people to fly more flights. But that&#39;s a very hypothetical proposition, another alternative is they just charge more per seat till fewer people choose to fly.>>><<<so if they went through all that work, what happened with 737max?>>><<<Im here for a college research paper.

This video makes you think all waste from machining is just, garbage.  WRONG WRONG WRONG.  I&#39;ve been machining for a while, not a pro or anything, but know that just about every machine shop iv&#39;e been in had some of chip management system that always collected chips made from production, and selling them back to the foundry, or they melt it down themselves.>>><<<In the future please include standard measurement along with the metric.

I know nothing about the technology used on 787&#39;s but am drawn into how the current future of cost-saving air travel is developing.

Unlike metal, those fibers don&#39;t take it well when you try to stretch em which means that the whole deal is gonna require frequent maintenance.

I watched so many air crash videos in the last couple of years,I will never get on a plane again. I do not know if I should be mad or glad ?>>><<<in my research I found that aluminum 7085 is used but now I&#39;m just even more confused because welding 7xxx aluminum invites stress corrosion and microcracks...?<br>nvm I worked it out, 7085 aluminium alloy is used for its inclusion of up to 8% zinc, which when paired with magnesium and copper, allows the alloy to be precipitation hardened, assisting to retard dislocations within the metal. Furthermore, inclusions of chromium improve corrosion resistance and help limit the stress corrosion that is often associated with welding zinc alloys. Zirconium is also added in order to inhibit recrystallisation, this prevents the growth of new defect-free grains, allowing the alloy to maintain its desirable hardness and strength characteristics. Finally, titanium inclusions are used to refine the primary aluminium grains, this increases the number of grain boundaries, resulting in a more ductile material. Controlling the grain size in this way also assists with corrosion resistance as having too many grain boundaries promotes galvanic corrosion, while coarse grains do not provide enough space or pathways for ions to travel through, making it difficult to develop a uniform passive film, thus reducing corrosion resistance.>>><<<Might be a good aircraft but only if you disregard tools, ladder and rags left after assembly, as well as lousy build quality and finally Boeing putting disregard passenger safety after profit.>>><<<They fucking patented fully metal fff 3d printing>>><<<787 is crap with all sorts of quality control issues.

They received billions in gov funding specifically for the 787, and would surely be bailed out if they were to fail (doubly so since they are a gov contractor). Hats off to the incredible engineers, but let&#39;s keep in context Boeing&#39;s historical lackluster leadership.<br><br>Yes, we all receive the huge benefit of the 787 if we fly, but we also paid $4 billion plus in just <b>illegal</b> subsidies (read: illegal according to the WTO). I&#39;m really not convinced Boeing has to &quot;risk&quot; anything at all at this point, more like &quot;ignore the problem til it starts killing people,&quot; as we saw in their recent history.>>><<<Less farting...............millions of dollars.............&quot;all new&quot; technology..............ah.......progress.>>><<<The 787 is probably the only plane I would trust going on a trip with>>><<<Can you please do the Engineering video of Airbus A350‚ù§>>><<<I love Engineering. <br>If Engineering was a girl, I&#39;d marry her...>>><<<What a pleasure to watch and even just listen to this video.>>><<<No more racial hustle for making a stopover at an airport in the US, B787 can fly directly to destinations from isolated Japan without a stopover in the US and Canada and avoid Russian airspace. This is a huge improvement for the Japanese. The worst flight was from Mexico City to Tokyo by B767, they needed to refuel at an airport in the US due to the westerly, but by the regulation, while refueling at an airport in the US, all passengers must disembark the plane. And there is no international area in airports in the US where passengers just sit and wait until refueling is over, and all disembarking passengers must go through passport control thus many Japanese and Mexicans get denied entry as usual and then detained in jail. They can never get their destination, they get deported back to Mexico. No wonder why Japanese ANA supported the development of 787, it&#39;s indeed a dream liner releasing them from racial harassment in the US.>>><<<I have the intension to study engineering.<br>This video help me to study hard.>>><<<This is why I love aviation>>><<<Imagine when they will develop new technology for engines which would be better jet engines.>>><<<I worked in this factory as the 787 began production.

The model of mass aviation currently is based on a massive and explicit government subsidy of an industry that would otherwise not exist.  There is also an implicit subsidy in the form of a lack of meaningful carbon pricing of aviation - free pollution! Free negative externalities! The behemoths and a hub model are more efficient modes of allocating the energy budget of mass transport and probably must return if we hope to have a safe and durable future.>>><<<It is wrong to say aircraft must fly below their critical Mach number. In fact, airliners routinely cruise above Mcrit. The speed to be avoided is the drag divergence Mach number (Mdd) and is typically 5 to 10% higher.

Is that true, does the 787 really have a separate system isolated from the engines for heating the cabin air?>>><<<The Cessna Citation 3, was the first airplane with a supercritical wing to be certified by the FAA back in 1982. Proven on a modified F-8 Crusader. It was certified to 51,000 feet, which is almost 20,000 feet higher than most airliners and business jets typically cruise. The &quot;cusp&quot; at the rear underside, was designed to eliminate the Mach &quot;tuck&quot; where the nose pitches down as you approach the speed of sound. This is what killed a lot of P-38 pilots who impacted &quot;terra firma&quot; when they found themselves in an uncontrollable dive which requires slowing down to recover as your dive becomes ever steeper! The first production model, owned by golfer Arnold Palmer, set time to altitude aircraft records of 12 min 1 s to 12,000 m (39,350 ft), and 23 min 43 s to 15,000 m (49,200 ft), and an airspeed record from Gander Airport to Paris le Bourget in 5 h 13 min, averaging 429 kn. Production continued for nine years until 1992, Cruise speed is 472 knots with the MMO or max mach operating comes at 491 knots and mach .851<br>   Also, even General aviation airplanes have been built with twisted wings, since the 40&#39;s. The idea, is to have the wing stall at the root first, so as to allow aileron effectiveness before entering the full stall, as it migrates outward with continuing increase in &quot;angle of attack.&quot;>>><<<That&#39;s all great but I&#39;ll never forget the terrible tragedy that Boeing, in the interests of profit, killed hundreds by implementing a poorly designed stall-correction system relying on a single sensor in the 737 max. Boeing knew it was bad, but they pushed it through. We should never forget. Profits before people is plain criminal.>>><<<Jumbo can accommodate 430only not 600>>><<<Is A350 not a carbon composite plane?>>><<<This is awesome!  I never knew that I thought it was just better on fuel.<br>Wait so can they patch damage caused by like birds or something?  Carbon fiber is not very good with high impact strength, and they can‚Äôt use a big metal patch like they do for metal fuselages.>>><<<The 787 is so bad that many Boeing employees will not fly on it, much like the 737 Max. Boeing is heading the same way as McDonnel Douglas, Douglas covered up faults on the DC 6, they made changes to the DC 8 which made it dangerous and then the DC 10 disaster.>>><<<What do you bet China already stealing this tech>>><<<Tickets are cheaper? which planet are you living in?>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapFQl6RezA&amp;t=48">0:48</a> my favorite airport (Oslo Gardermoen) üòç>>><<<Oh, sure.

In a metal aircraft, these transients&#39; currents (in thousands of Amperes) are carried on the surface of the fuselage. In the 787, the currents are carried on bus bars running through the bilge, under the floor and in the overhead.  Being connected in parallel, their combined resistance is very low; however, the voltage drops over the length of the aircraft and wing tip to wing tip due to the very high current can be hundreds of volts (Ohm&#39;s Law).  Associated with the high voltage are electric and induced magnetic fields.  All electronic equipment and interconnecting cabling were designed not to be affected by these lightning induced fields.

BUT the quality and the supply-chain failures showed that Boeing made too many shortcuts with a cascade of suppliers and sub-contractors. With a quite poor quality level and even, some design flaws appeared when the FAA decided to make REAL and RIGOROUS checks. Boeing never cared about that aspect and could sell that plane like hot potatoes. Until the B737 MAX fiasco made clear that Boeing corrupted the FAA for the certification of all planes. And today, the B787 program is costing a fortune to Boeing. Despite high sales. A Dramaliner. The problem is that the B777X seems to be designed in the same way. Bad bad bad management at Boeing. Even somehow criminal...>>><<<Well, it is a BEAUTIFUL airplane indeed, and hopefully it will do well. But it was not all this nice at the beginning. There was a 60 MINUTES story about this plane, the 787, and how RIDICULOUS its initial construction and introduction was. The interim plane was just an &quot;empty shell&quot;, just to demonstrate to reporters and businesses people, as it was so behind schedule, but when they found out, because there was gonna be no demonstration flight, it was a BAD PRESS! Boeing was cutting corners everywhere to save money, using below pair parts; parts that wouldn&#39;t pass initial inspection  or that wouldn&#39;t last as needed, were being used anyways, etc. Whistleblowers were being threatened and fired by Boeing, it was absolutely SHAMEFUL!>>><<<Is there an example of creating something to be as efficient as possible no matter what the cost or manufacturing difficulty is, because if so, I would like to see it.>>><<<You background sound is so irritating and annoying we stopped viewing you video>>><<<The a350 isn‚Äôt comparable what so ever.

Boeing is out selling the airbus 30 to 1.>>><<<The beginning part of the video drives so much into the fact that the wings are highly flexible but never talked about the performance advantage of having a flexible wing. The high amount of flex is actually a byproduct of the property of CFRP material, which has better specific strength. There is no significant advantage of using a flexible wing over a more rigid wing, aerodynamically speaking. In fact, there might even be minimal negative impact.>>><<<Love this channel and really respect your knowledge. But ... there is no such thing as a &quot;negative balance sheet&quot;.

Rip 747>>><<<I like how he says &quot;kherben&quot; fibre.>>><<<the insane engineering of boeing 737>>><<<I wonder what they are saying about the Sackler settlement. The incredibly generous, new, Sackler settlement, V2.0, was changed to provide $750 million for the victims, of which 149,000 have made claims out of 500,000 deaths caused by the opioid deaths that have occurred in the US, albeit others were also involved. See CNBC. <br><br>That means that if divided equally, each victim‚Äôs surviving family members would receive just about $5000 per death of or injury to their dad, mom, child, or relative, when if their court cases had been allowed to be filed against the Sacklers, juries would have awarded judgments against the Sacklers that I opine would have ranged from $250,000 per victim to $100,000,000 per victim, including punitive damages. If the Sacklers had lost just one lawsuit and been found negligent or to have acted wrongfully as to victims in one lawsuit brought against them, then that judgment would have become ‚Äúres judicata‚Äù as to their negligence, etc., knowledge, etc.  Then, later victims could easily get settlements against them by merely citing the final judgment (the doctrine of &quot;collateral estoppel&quot;) against the Sacklers, which would have established the Sackler‚Äôs misconduct.<br><br>Via this settlement, therefore, it is likely that the Sacklers saved the rest of their reported $11 BILLION dollar fortune by paying just $6 billion. Thus, this corrupt settlement arguably violates the constitution‚Äôs ‚Äútakings‚Äù clause, because it is misusing government power (the bankruptcy court‚Äôs power as an agent of government) to rob the victims who are the survivors of persons who had opioid caused deaths of causes of action against the Sacklers worth many, many billions: from the &quot;expected value&quot; of jury awards (from which those victims could even borrow right now but for the settlement) for a paltry sum that may have to be divided among nearly 500,000 claimants. <br><br>However, due to whatever the AGs and other politicians received, none of the states apparently will appeal again to set aside this settlement, which is grossly unfair to the victims: they rescued defeat from the jaws of victory. They now can share beers and laugh and yell: &quot;to hell with the victims&#39; families,&quot; which must include members of every ethnic, racial, religious, and other group in the USA because opioid addiction has become very common among all groups. I bet those AGs and politicians that gave the Sacklers such a generous deal will receive contributions from the Sacklers and their allies for the rest of their lives; some may become senators or even presidents.

On the same 787 flight, we were delayed and we DID have numerous &quot;power problems&quot; (lights going out, etc.) at the gate. Pilots came on the PA and said as much but decided to proceed with the flight. Later we learned about the battery problems. The &quot;industry&quot; should have foreseen this..

The R&amp;D costs of the program and the compensation paid to airlines for late delivery has far outweighed the sales revenue.  The fasteners have been a disaster, the curing of the fuselage rings has been a disaster, the supply chain has been a disaster. Boeing employees have openly criticised the poor quality and lack of safety culture at the production sites. When you bet the firm on a radical program, it apparently cannot be allowed to fail even if that puts shareholders and passengers at risk>>><<<When Boeing merged with McDonnel Douglas, they started having way too many issues.  The 787 is a horribly engineered and designed aircraft, 2nd only to the 737 MAX.  Boeing cut their own safety standards and protocols just to meet the bottom line.  The entire development was delayed for 2 years, and when they finally rolled on to the runway they were catching on fire due to a lack of research and applications of a poorly designed (known flaws) Li-Ion battery pack.  The company that made the chargers tried numerous times to stop the production, and when their entire facility burned to the ground in Tuscon, AZ Boeing just found a new provider for the chargers, while keeping the same battery.  Plenty of FAA documents citing Boeing employees quitting/retiring over safety protocols being ignored by higher ups, yet Boeing just kept on rolling.>>><<<nice try, Boeing :)>>><<<Need a Similar Video on A350 XWB please>>><<<Good one>>><<<Shots fired at Colin McGregor xD>>><<<And yet more insane use of the word insane and incorrectly by an Irish fella talking American>>><<<Very impressive, and they didn&#39;t even go into the amenities on the inside of the 787 which are a game changer in themselves.>>><<<Wait a minute wait a minute ...

Thank you for this work.>>><<<In the force vs displacement diagram showing the difference between the aluminum alloy and the new composite material indicates that during unloading the composite does not take a permanent set.  Later the speaker seems to infer that this characteristic is used as a matter of course for the 787.  I don‚Äôt think the composite material can repeatedly go into the plastic deformation zone and then return to the elastic strain zone repeatedly without consequence.  I‚Äôm a retired mechanical engineer and my experience with composites was during R&amp;D phases.  The characteristic mentioned is noteworthy and possibly able to reduce or minimize damage during an over stressed event but I don‚Äôt think it is a part of any ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù document.  I think the design requirement is still to stay in the elastic region during all of the verification and durability testing.  Perhaps someone closer to this project could provide a more definite explanation.  It still is a lot of new territory for Boeing to integrate into a production design all at once.  Im sure there are some untold stories that those of us that have been through our own little battles would love to hear. Good job to the men and women that pulled that program off.>>><<<What is insane about it? The title?

It&#39;s full of false facts and myths.<br><br>That intro begins with a lie. <br><br>The B789, most sold nightmare liner, is always flying to or from hubs. It has a lot of Hub to N connections. It was good marketing by Boeing, but in fact it&#39;s just not true that the B787 is flying point 2 point.<br><br>Airbus was actually well ahead in the use of composite materials, for example the A380 was the first aircraft with a carbon fiber wing. Not the 87. <br>That&#39;s also why Boeing had to outsource a lot to japanese companies who just had more experience. <br>The B787 fuselage tons are actually a disadvantage and it&#39;s highly likley Boeing will change to the Airbus approach at the A350, by mounting carbon fiber sheets on an AL frame. It&#39;s very hard to repair damage on a B787 fuselage, it&#39;s very hard to build and handle on these large pieces, and it&#39;s hard for further development. For example, it&#39;s unclear if you can build in a freight door to turn the 87 into a freighter. <br>The wing is good, but supercritical wings are standart since the A300, which is a now 50 year old design. <br><br>The main advantage the B787 has over the A380 is, that it&#39;s engine have over 10% lower specific fuel burn. <br><br>Economicaly , the B787 is a desaster for Boeing. Another such &quot;victory&quot; and they can fill chapter 11. 30 bn. evelopment cost, 30bn. deferred cost. And as the A350 and A330neo now have the same generation engine, it&#39;s hard to see how Boeing wants to make this cost up when they keep selling for about 110 Mio. $ per jet. <br>It turend out to be a good airplane, but Boeing is selling it cheap, has huge quality and production issues, had a grounding and was lucky not too suffer a hull loss in the early days due to self inflamation. They were just luck these jets started burning on the ground.<br><br>I guess that&#39;s not sucessfull engineering, at least by my means.>>><<<The fantastic A380 will fly for years to come! The 747 as a passenger plane is indeed gone.>>><<<Travelled once (before the plaque)with 350 once with 380 once with 747 and 787. I would prefer the 350. But it&#39;s an even call.

A concept first used in Formula1 by Red-Bull, to get around the &#39;bendy wing&#39; restrictions in F1. An ingenious concept that allows the wing to behave exactly like you want at different speeds. Unfortunately, other teams later caught wind of this and it was eventually out lawed by the FIA. Great to see this clever concept has found it&#39;s way into the aeronautical industry and is making air travel more efficient.>>><<<I wouldn‚Äôt call this insane engineering because it is what‚Äôs expected. What isn‚Äôt expected is Boeings other ways of cost cutting, such as,  promises to governments, employees, &amp; unions to keep production in one area in order to get guarantees on tax cuts &amp; acceptance of union contracts‚Ä¶ Then after developing the jet, turning your back on everybody, telling government to cancel tax cuts, closing production entirely in that location and moving it 3,000 miles away to an economic impoverished area whenre a highly skilled &amp; better educated work force is harder to obtain. Although a lower cost unskilled &amp; undereducated work force is easily available with the hope that over time they will become more skilled &amp; educated -but still accept lower wages for ‚Äúlong term‚Äù cost cutting measures. And so you have it, the 787 first designed &amp; built within the hub of all of Boeings commercial engineering &amp; production being moved because Boeing basically maintains the same strategy of most American manufacturing giants that wages are the number one reason why things are so expensive &amp; that by eliminating wages you lower costs. This being said, it should also be noted Boeing spent the 1980s &amp; 90s buying out all their competitions except for Airbus -which isn‚Äôt really a fair comparison to competition because it is subsidized by the European Union. But when you eliminate all your competition then there really is no need to improve manufacturing techniques because you can set any price you want, so you need to only set a price slightly lower than a subsidized European manufacturer. Boeing can barely do that. Make no mistake the 747 was the cash cow which built Boeing into what it is today. Today it‚Äôs the 777 &amp; the old reliable 1965 designed 737 which are the surviving cash cows &amp; they are using modern techniques to improve old school designs but still depending on those old school designs because it‚Äôs cost prohibitive to design a new replacement jet. What you have is an old school style of management which conflicts with nor understands the complexities of modern design &amp; the sheer size of departments &amp; lack of cross training creates empires which do not understand other empires causing time delays erupting in conflicts &amp; threatens quality -as we‚Äôve seen with the 737-max because management failed to agree upon their failure of estimating how much time it would take to work out the bugs in software &amp; hardware design, training, &amp; threatened departments who were already under pressure &amp; then made decisions for them in which they lacked technical ability to even make those decisions, rather they used their power to make those decisions and bet the reputation of the company as the only form of quality they needed -resulting in 350 deaths, when 2 Max jets crashed. A problem entirely the fault of management making decisions they had no expertise in. Yet when this was revealed they called those who exposed this on ‚Äúdisgruntled engineers‚Äù in an attempt to coverup the bullshit. A common practice at any company which uses threats to build a workforce.<br><br>It‚Äôs no surprise there are no more orders being made for the 787 today &amp; that the last orders are being built.  Boeing has been making some outrageous management decisions ever since they moved headquarters from Seattle to Chicago. Simply said, Chicago doesn‚Äôt have a clue what is going on at their factories and blame the factories for any problems. They need to take a long look in the mirror and accept personal accountability, and the fact they can no longer accurately predict problems associated in modern design or market needs. The money wasted on revamping the 747 into the 747-8 is a classic example because it was built by entirely new employees who had to learn everything from scratch &amp; dilapidated drawings from the late 60s which needed to be changed for modern production, but weren‚Äôt. Boeing allowed the transfer of all experienced employees to transfer to the 787 team &amp; relied upon antiquated production techniques and an entirely new untrained inexperienced labor force to build a brand new 747 which was hardly new except for the interior look. To solve production problems Boeing made overtime mandatory for unreasonable periods of time &amp; management threatened employees with termination if they fell from the demands of unreasonable work hours &amp; demands placed on unskilled labor by demanding they do jobs in a skilled labor amount of time. It‚Äôs no surprise these employees transferred or quit as soon as they could requiring hiring of more unskilled labor of which there simply was no skilled labor to train them because they either transferred or were fired for not putting in 60+ hour weeks or were seen as non productive as they couldn‚Äôt finish a job in a skilled employees amount of time. How could they? They were handed an old drawing which didn‚Äôt always show step by step procedures to ensure quality &amp; weren‚Äôt even properly trained &amp; were punished for the slightest error, a result of being insufficiently trained. The FAA further made production worse by refusing to allow production created aids that had been used for decades as tools or notes for drawings &amp; demanded they be documented or thrown away. You simply couldnt finish a job not using them &amp; could be fired if you did. In addition drawing change requests made before production began by skilled employees were thrown away because they weren&#39;t written by engineers. This &quot;empire&quot; mentality had nothing to do with quality it was all about power and added millions in cost overruns. All in all you felt like you were walking on egg shells. This seriously caused major delays &amp; a total lack of management &amp; the FAA to work together to end up with a top rated build simply was impossible. However Boeing should have fixed these errors back in the 80s &amp; the FAA should have caught all of this back then as well. I saw this personally, it was outrageous &amp; knew my time was limited when i found out my 4 months of tedious drawing change requests were thrown away. Everything had a fix and no i am not an engineer, but an engineer doesnt have to make a request for change, an engineer has to approve or disapprove. To throw away mine &amp; everybodies work was criminal &amp; nobody cared until the problems popped up in probably n. Outrageous toxic &amp; narcissistic is how the atmosphere is best described. The result was the first customer not even accepting the first plane when it eventually rolled off the assembly line with 50,000 extra pounds of patchwork which made its integrity look skeptical. It‚Äôs no wonder the Queen of the Skies became theTitanic of the Skies, and that is simply a gross neglect of management to admit they caused it, but blaming everybody else instead of accepting personal accountability &amp; solving the problems. Last I heard it cost $8-billion &amp; Boeing turned the cash cow into cash deficit gas hog draining the company.>>><<<lots and lots of bulls: more comfrtanle planes, cheaper tickets. where the henll do you people live?>>><<<TOO BAD THE YOUTUBE CESSPOOL HAS DISABLED DISLIKES, BECAUSE THIS VIDEO DESERVES A DISLIKE JUST FOR SAYING AIRLINES ARE BENEFITTING US.

Technologies can be easily hijacked by evil spirit!>>><<<Great design but if you remember that there was long delays on delivery of this plane. The reason was that the Japanese company that was supposed to make the fuselage was having trouble meeting specifications. They could not get the process right without cracks in the fuselage. In testing it failed. The long delays caused reputation issues and buyers were starting back out. Boeing executives ordered the planes be built even with these flaws. Many people working for Boeing did not like that they were skipping safety for deadlines and made complaints and were fired. The 737 Max 8, with its bad stabilization software and system design, is  proof that Boeing is willing to cut corners for profits over peoples lives. 2 of these planes dived straight into the ground and would not respond to pilot commands. Internally Boeing&#39;s test pilots said that the system was oscillating and none responsive and that it was a big issue. Boeing deemed it a rare occurrence and went ahead with the installation of the MCAS system.  I would not ever fly on the 787 because its only a matter of time before they start falling apart in mid air. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvkEpstd9os">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvkEpstd9os</a>>>><<<Nice video>>><<<It might have been really helpful to point out the distinction of turbulent flow and flow that has detached and separated from the surface of the wing.

As an occasional air traveler and one who has always been fascinated with aircraft yet know very little about them both planes were a bucket list item for me to fly in. The 787-9 was wonderful. The 787-9 was American Airlines and was still as originally delivered from Boeing. The 747-400 was British Airways and had been recently upgraded in the last year or so. The 747-400 was a very pleasant flight and very comfortable but it still couldn‚Äôt compare to how smooth and quiet the 787-9 was. Trying to book a flight on a 777. I‚Äôm just not an Airbus fan.

Boeing admitted years ago that the 747 could have been a little smaller times were much different at the peak of the 747 versus the peak of the A380. I believe Airbus was very optimistic on their estimation of I think it was over 1,200 super jumbo Jets over the next two decades.

One critique though: the 787 and A350 hardly compete. The only crossover is between the 787-10 and A350-900, and even then they are somewhat in different classes.

Why don&#39;t they just devote their energies to giving people brain implants so that they don&#39;t have to fly at all, everyone can just stay at home in bed and experience a completely virtual life experience, or am I possibly taking things a little too far here, (at least for now)?

Not Bernoulli again. It is not the faster moving air on top of the wing, resulting in lower pressure (Bernoulli&#39;s principle), that creates the lift needed to keep an airfoil airborne. The lift is nearly solely created by Newton&#39;s third law: if the oncoming flow of air is deflected downwards, this creates a lift force equal to the force needed to deflect the air. So in designing airfoils, the attention should go to that part of the wing that deflects the air, which is the trailing edge. Most important about the leading edge is that it is smooth enough as to not create extra drag.>>><<<Back in the day I worked on planes 1 thru 15 in Charleston SC building the avionics / power harnesses for the main fuselage.

Diamond/CBN or ceramic can not be used for the production of titanium parts because of the chemical reactions. Titanium is a material that doesnt save up heat heat well and thus the heat gets directed on to the cutting edge and at the same time has a high cutting force, shortening the tool life of your inserts/tool significantly. This means you will have high production cost and production time while working on titanium/alloys.<br><br>CFRP or carbon fibre reeinforced polymers can be very abrasive towards your cutting edge. However the cutting force is quite low and  at the same time here you can use diamond coated tools as there is no reaction with the coating and the CFRP Material.>>><<<So from what I understand, the early 787s  will be safer/better built than future 787s because of the extra titanium and the extra safety measures used in the wings regarding the lightning strike protection, etc. it‚Äôs a shame when companies take out safety measures regardless if it wasn‚Äôt needed to that extent in order to cut costs, you never know what could happen in that scenario.>>><<<Fantastic!

This effect is what causes certain fasteners in your car to become <b>*badly*</b> frozen together.  Ever try to get a lug nut off an old wheel, only to have the stud twist and break?  Have a head bolt or stud/nut combination so badly frozen you have to use a blowtorch, or drill the bolt out?  <br>It&#39;s all coming from the same source as what&#39;s being discussed here.  It&#39;s impossible to get rid of galling completely, but Permatex Anti Seize Lubricant should ALways be in your tool kit.  Use it EVERYwhere you need to torque down nuts and bolts fairly tightly.  It works very well in what it does, and I&#39;ll leave it at that description:<br>Galling literally means that the surfaces that are torqued together, over time, will begin to share molecular bonds between the two metals that are tightened together.  At the molecular level this means the two materials share electron orbits so well that it&#39;s actually impossible to say where the bolt ends, and the hole in the block starts.  Impossible to tell where the lug nut ends, and the stud begins, (or on German cars, where the bolt ends and the hub assembly begins).  <br>I&#39;m way off topic compared with what&#39;s going on with this video, but when I heard the term &quot;galvanic&quot;, it put me in mind of times I&#39;ve cursed the day I was born because I&#39;d encountered a frozen nut or bolt.  I had to write this, for those folks who aren&#39;t afraid to grab their toolbox and dive under the hood of their car, only to find something they&#39;d never quite seen be so stubborn as THIS particular bolt in THAT particular assembly.<br><br>Get yourself some Permatex, and use it on EVERYTHING you torque down, from lug nuts to head bolts ... those bolts that hold your alternator or starter in place, ... the bolts that hold CV joints to half-shafts, and anything having to do with exhaust manifolds and catalytic converters.<br>Somewhere down the road you&#39;ll be happy you did.  <br><br>PS  <br>Cheesus I love videos on this channel!!!

He was a McDonnel Douglass engineer at the time and believed that it was the material of the future. All his bosses and coworkers thought he was crazy and it would fail catastrophically if it ever suffered a lightning strike. He finally convinced some of his higher ups to let him try it out on the airbrake for some F-15‚Äôs, as if that failed it wouldn‚Äôt bring down the aircraft. Eventually one of them did get hit by lightning and it didn‚Äôt explode or fall apart. That turned out to be the defining moment of his career. He went on to lead the design team for the ACES II ejection seat, and eventually become the Chief Program Engineer for the F-16 and F-18 projects. Unfortunately there isn‚Äôt much else myself or any of my family knows about what he actually did because most of it is still classified by the feds and he could never really tell any of us about most of the stuff he worked on and was pretty humble in general so nobody in our family ever even realized how big of an impact he had until he passed away and we saw the letters and the people who showed up for the funeral.

Put your right hand up in the air if you trust the Boeing Management to not force the engineers to make compromises in safety to hit a target price for these aircraft.  Now I can visualise thousands of people with one hand in the air.>>><<<Also, from my personal experience with the dreamliner, the huge window is truly mind-blowing. But other than that, it just doesn&#39;t feel too different from the previous generation airliners. All those fancy technologies that were aimed to bring a revolutionary passenger experience were completed ruined by its narrow seat width with a 3-3-3 layout in a relatively narrower cabin. For a 6-foot-1 man like me, the 777 with a wider seat beats the Dreamliner in passenger comfort by a mile, despite all the latest tech advancements in the latter. Sometimes customer experience is as simple as that.>>><<<Ironically, roughly half of the Dreamliners in the skies have chosen the RR Trent 1000 power plant, which we now know is plagued with disastrous reliability and has caused many troubles. This Ill-fated engine, combined with Boeing&#39;s poor quality control and corner - cutting production processes in recent years (specifically at the South Carolina plant), has severely tarnished the Dreamliner&#39;s reputation. What would&#39;ve become an engineering marvel and a game changer in the industry has turned out to have stirred many controversies and complaints among its customers, being frequently grounded and out of service. <br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m still a huge fan of Boeing and am amazed by the sheer amount of engineering ingenuity that goes into the Dreamliner, but I can kind of relate when people say that the less innovative but more proven 777 is the &#39;last truly great products of Boeing.>>><<<Who else cant believe  they watched this to the end?>>><<<Yay i feel much better now>>><<<Pretty interesting informations here.>>><<<If you were my teacher in high school, I&#39;d have had A&#39;s in Math, Physics and Chemistry.>>><<<I‚Äôve been watching sooo many airliner crashes lately and literally everybody dies on the plane when it crashes .

The A350 goes more against the 777 and now the 777X.>>><<<The main reason why smaller planes twin engine airplanes took over bigger 4 engine airplanes  was mainly the development and improvement of engines. Engines in the 787 are 20%+ more efficient than its predecessor, basically producing more trust while burning less fuel. The copper mesh you mention on the wing is all over the fuselage for the reason you described which is conducting electricity mainly from lighting strikes. I am NOT aware they removing any of it because it is a safety issue. If they were to remove this copper mesh the fuselage primary structure with be left without protection creating A LOT of issues  structurally. Repairs and damages are already a huge issue with the mesh I can&#39;t imagine how it would be with out it. For example. A given lighting strike damage on an aluminum airplane may take couple of days to fix it (when is bad). A similar damage un a composite fuselage may take around a month and millions of dollars to do it with limited people in the world that have the tooling and skill set to do it. This may change in the future but right now it is a big deal.>>><<<‚ÄúHow‚Äù - quote from every other plane manufacturer>>><<<The first car I ever owned in 1966 had a body made from fibreglass reinforced plastic. It was lighter and stronger than steel and enabled the car to have a smaller, more economical engine than other mini cars.

That&#39;s very similar to how the wings of the 787 use carbon layup to increase strength in specific areas but allow flexibility in others.>>><<<Metric>>><<<Insane engineering but worst experience as a passenger in these.

Thank you. I really enjoy your Channel. However, the weighing up of the pros and cons of CFRP structures vs more conventional metallic ones seemed a bit‚Ä¶ incomplete and bias towards the CFRP technology. I think, all things considered, there is not such a big gap between metallic and CFRP for conventional aircraft configurations (wing and tube). More so for blended blended wing size type configurations perhaps. It would have been good to include; BVID and its effect on mechanical properties and the limitations this causes in design and the considerations it requires in the overall manufacture and operation of the aircraft. The highly orthotropic properties of CFRP, particularly in the through-thickness/OoP loading direction and the problems this can cause in particular corner unfolding. Bonding/co-curing and the issues with ensuring an effective bond. Peeling stresses and geometric discontinuities. CTE mis-match between CFRP and Al alloys (actually one of the main drivers for use of Ti in hybrid CFRP and metallic structures, corrosion is important but there are protection schemes which enable Al-&gt;CFRP assys). The relatively poor tolerances which can be achieved in producing CFRP parts and their assy into the aircraft and the issues this brings‚Ä¶.. The list could go on and on. It is great to see so many students of engineering engaged in the comments. I would encourage them to dig a bit deeper in the practical realities before concluding CFRP is a wonder material. Like all materials, when applied and designed properly it is fantastic. Unfortunately in the real world other considerations come it to play‚Ä¶.>>><<<My needs are climate change mitigation.

Reflection of the disaster that Boeing has become since allowing McDD execs into the company.>>><<<Thanks for your sharing>>><<<I was on the preliminary design team of the 787. This video does an admirable job of documenting the technology and the design challenges. There are a few items that are just slightly incorrect. The composite wing is nowhere close to being able to make 19000 microstrain or 1.9% of elastic deformation. This is a value that is appropriate for what is called a uni-axial tensile coupon, one that is made of only fibers in the 0-degree direction aligned with the load application. In actuality when the airplane is designed, fibers are added in the plus and minus 45-degree direction to take the load around holes and cutouts, and one also requires fibers in the 90-degree direction. The wings also need to be designed for holes for fasteners, manufacturing flaws and any accidental damage that might occur in-service. This reduces the design strain further to below 50% of the pristine material. And remember as well that if the wing lower surface is tension than the upper surface is in compression. So exceptional tensile capability is useful but the wing strength may actually be designed by the compression capability of the material. In addition, composite material will have a strength reduction at elevated temperature, like that in the Middle East, or low temperatures, like that at high altitude.>>><<<How is all this rich information free? Thank you Ad lords.>>><<<Oh, great...I freak out when I look out my window and see the wings flex a couple feet in a conventional aluminum body aircraft.

My dad was an engineer on the original 747 and then the SST before it was cancelled, and I was born and raised in Seattle, and I must say each new plane was like a new baby and a big event to Seattleites, before the current population boom of the last 10 years. But, we certainly have mixed feeling about the 787, it&#39;s kind of a symbol of Boeing&#39;s decline to us. Boeing was a rock-solid engineering-and-manufacturing-first company. But when headquarters moved to Chicago, so much about the company changed. And while excellent engineers worked on the 787, and your video shows all the amazing advancements, there was a lot of time and money pressure from Chicago that wouldn&#39;t have existed before. And there were issues with the whole consortium of companies working on the plane. The fact that the &quot;1st plane&quot; debut was a fake shell of a plane was an embarrassment, and then the first 10 or so planes had to be completely reworked. But finally, the plane was ready, and we in Seattle were excited for first flight in 2009, and I have a picture of that first flight so clear from my home on a cloudy December day, with two tiny planes on each side of it. I moved to Korea just a few months later, so I was really looking forward to a relaxing flight over the Pacific sometime in the next few years. But... the two main Korean airlines didn&#39;t order any for many years. And then the lithium-ion batteries had problems. And then there was the whole issue with the planes&#39; manufacturing being split between the Seattle area and South Carolina. But finally, a few Japanese airlines were flying the 787 regularly. In 2012, JAL even had an advertisement in the Seoul metro for a flight between Narita and Boston, hoping Koreans would take a connecting flight to Japan. (The ad literally said &quot;BOSTON! JAL! 787!&quot; before the fine print at the bottom). Finally I saw a 787 on the tarmac at Haneda airport in 2013, but it wasn&#39;t my plane. Finally in 2016 I purposely chose the non-direct Seoul - Vancouver BC, Vancouver BC - Seattle on Air Canada so I could fly on a 787! It was plane C-FNOE, and it was a great flight, but... each air vent above every window seat seemed to have a little patch of mold around it. So it was a little disconcerting to have that on a plane that was just about a year old; I&#39;d never seen anything like that on my many flights. I hope whatever ventilation issue there was was limited to that plane and has been fixed by now.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had a chance to fly on another one, as there aren&#39;t many 787s flying into Korea compared to Japan. But I&#39;d love to once again, and still hope for the best for the plane and for Boeing and all its excellent workers and engineers. Even in 2015, bright green 737 fuselages would still be carried on trains not far from my house (I&#39;ve got cool pictures of this too), as they had to be transported between plants in Everett and Renton, and I can assume Seattleites can still see this tangible part of our manufacturing culture. Thanks for the great info. and video you&#39;ve put together! Despite the many issues, the 787 is an amazing plane and something to be proud of. I&#39;ve subscribed; cheers!>>><<<&#39;Insane engineering&#39; is absolutely NOT what I want; Airbus forever or walk!>>><<<meanwhile, Elon made a spaceship out of steel.>>><<<Excellent video, except for the unnecessary &quot;music.&quot; Nothing but a distraction, especially toward the end.>>><<<Airbus were thinking of the environment transporting alot of people to main hubs, Boeing did that classic Boeing and thought since the 747 was so hideously designed (research the centre fuel tank problems with 747&#39;s that costs the lives of hundreds) they&#39;d not compete with Airbus and try and change the industry.>>><<<good luck against A350...>>><<<But the composite materials is susceptible to fire hazards.

That&#39;s sort of true, but I think that the reason 3D printing is being use more is a little more complicated than that. I think that the cost comes from the time it takes to remove the material, not the lost material itself.<br><br>Machining is expensive because it&#39;s slow compared to other processes. Stamping something out of metal takes seconds for dozens of parts. Machining is a few minutes for one part. But they both &quot;waste metal&quot;. Either way the chips or cookie-cutter left over metal a is recycled and you get some money back.<br><br>3D printing doesn&#39;t waste as much metal, but it&#39;s likely even slower than most machining. The reason it might be a net gain is that the airline industry probably wants very light parts.<br><br>If you need a rectangle cut out of titanium, the mill will easily beat the 3D printer. If you need a rectangle that has a honeycomb of holes cut out of the middle to save weight, that&#39;s where it gets interesting. The mill has to cut all of those hexagons one at a time, roughing out and finishing each one. If you start with 3D printed material that&#39;s already mostly air rather then metal, then you only need to do finishing in critical areas with the mill. You also wear out tooling slower this way. If you&#39;re doing even more complex parts, and can get rid of some operations and fixtures a mill would do, or even make internal features a mill couldn&#39;t make at all, then 3D printing becomes a huge win.<br><br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible some money is saved on titanium, but I think it&#39;s common for people outside of manufacturing to over estimate how much cost comes materials and underestimate how much cost comes from time.>>><<<Wonder why not just use carbon fiber for the titanium parts too?>>><<<I wonder if the trap doors on the tail are for the waste gate of the turbines that are sucking the air in.

It kinda makes me hope they get there head out of there rear end overall. Things like the SLS project, starliner, Vulcan and 737 demonstrate the need for consistency and reliability over pushing materials and technological limits. I think that&#39;s the brutal reality SpaceX has brought to there doorstep in rocket systems. I don&#39;t see the falcon9 as a rocket that pushed the limits. SpaceX actually used a lot of technology that was already present in other industries. I&#39;m not saying SpaceX doesn&#39;t innovate... They do..... Sometimes though innovation isn&#39;t about using absolute technological advantage... Same with the 737 max... They wanted to push the limit of the air frame with newer bigger engines. It was simple well known practices that got missed. An extra angle of attack sensor would have pretty much prevented the whole debacle. Instead the focus was on getting a more technically advanced huge engine Under the wing. I wonder about this when I look at the 787... The boundary layer control is so amazing... How well is it going to age though? Better yet... What happens if it catastrophically fails?... Hopefully Boeings long game works out with it.>>><<<Here before 787k views>>><<<Used to fly between S√£o Paulo and CDMX in the 787.

Very well presented. <br>However I must correct one mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapFQl6RezA&amp;t=830">13:50</a>: airliners don&#39;t cruise below their critical Mach number, they cruise just above it. Here‚Äôs one reference: the book &quot;Aircraft design: a conceptual approach&quot; by Raymer, section 12.5.10 - parasite drag. <br>Quoting the relevant points: &quot;drag divergent Mach (Boeing definition) is is usually 0.08 Mach above the critical Mach number.&quot;<br>&quot;The Douglas definition, also used by the U.S. Air Force... is typically 0.06 Mach above the Boeing Mdd...&quot;<br>&quot;Jet transports usually cruise at about Mdd (Boeing) and have a maximum level speed of about Mdd (Douglas).&quot;<br>So the bottom line is Mdd (Douglas) &gt; Mdd (Boeing) &gt; Mcr, and airliners cruise at Mdd (Boeing) and have a max speed of Mdd (Douglas), both above their critical Mach.<br><br>Here&#39;s one visual proof that airliners fly above their critical Mach: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HekbC6Pl4_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HekbC6Pl4_Y</a>. <br>Shockwaves can be seen by their shadow on top of the wing of this 737.>>><<<&quot;Todays episode is sponsored by Boeing&quot;<br>hehehe>>><<<Thank you for the education..

They look absolutely stunning>>><<<At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapFQl6RezA&amp;t=1094">18:14</a>, The HLFC panels are actually part of the Empennage Door Actuation System (EDAS). The doors are closed when on the ground. At low airspeed the doors open for &quot;purge mode&quot; sucking air in and sending it up the vertical stabilizer back out through perforations on the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. During cruise and high airspeed, the doors go into &quot;suction mode&quot; by creating a low pressure at the doors, reversing the airflow pulling air through the small perforations and sending it out the EDAS port. This decreases the thickness of the boundary layer airflow to maintain laminar flow and hence decrease drag along the vertical stabilizer. It is mainly used in &quot;suction mode&quot; as this reduces drag more. The &quot;purge mode&quot; is used more often to remove water and debris from the perforated holes. The EDAS system is only on the vertical stabilizer and is only applicable on all 787-10s and the 787-9s after production line number 526.

More recently, the inner skin on the fuselage of a number of Dreamliners was found to be too rough, and certain shims, which are used to fill gaps during the assembly of various fuselage sections, were found to have been improperly manufactured. Due to those errors, planes might have been unable to withstand normal loads in flight.<br><br>In September 2020, the vertical tail fin and horizontal stabilizers came under scrutiny due to a potential error with autopilot systems.

With its leaner fleet, Qantas will fly you anywhere in Europe you want to go! Paris? Sure, Qantas will fly you to London. Rome? Certainly, there are many flights to London every week. Athens? Hey, London is close enough that you could almost walk. I&#39;m not arguing against the engineering benefits of the 787 but don&#39;t tell me for a minute that anyone who flies with Qantas will benefit from them. Experience tells me otherwise.<br><br>The engineering content was interesting, though.>>><<<Fun fact for the audience: <br><br>I used to work as a de-icer in Canada and you really noticed how heat didn‚Äôt travel as well on the 787‚Äôs fuselage because of composite material.>>><<<With the whole plane being out of carbon fibre, they could be easily switching to carbon fibre structual batteries for their electric planes>>><<<Your pronunciation of &quot;but&quot; is awesome>>><<<Politics of engineering.<br>Video for a Salesman rather than an engineer. a good perception builder.>>><<<Excellent Video!>>><<<Worked at Toray composites for a while testing the prepreg we made for this plane and many others. The tech is really cool but the process of making composite parts is really really expensive and time consuming. Not gonna be common in consumer goods until new processes are invented. The fricken carbon/copper mesh fabric was a bitch to machine and cut up my gloves constantly. Was also significantly heavier and weaker. I‚Äôm glad they quit using it lol>>><<<As someone who works maintaining aircraft and has worked a lot onthe 787, I have to admit that it is my favorite aircraft, the 787 is going to keep me employed for many many years into the future. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the video on the 787 electrical system.<br><br>In my opinion the 787 tried to do too many new things at once, the removal of bleed air and the fully intergrated electrical systems has been a complete nightmare for Boeing and airlines. The removal of bleed air has made the engines more efficient but they have had to radically change the way the whole electrical system is feed, distributed and cooled, as well as completely changes the aircondition system.<br>The PECS and ICS system, aircondition fans and compressors, and high voltage DC systems seem to break down very frequently, the amount of jobs that are regularly one on the 787 vs the 777 is pretty astronimical. <br><br>The carbonfibre construction actually comes with quite a few headaches too, tradtitional aircraft could be repair after an impact or after a lightning strike pretty rapidly but that&#39;s not the case with the 787. It will likely improve in the future as more aircraft are damaged in service but there have been aircraft that have been grounded for months as no repair scheme was available.<br>The aircraft also seems to be more prone to lightning strikes, whilst not rare on older aircraft the 787 seems more prone to lightning strikes and due to the more difficult repair schemes this can be a major headache to airlines and there engineering teams.<br><br>The A350 took a fair more conservative approach than the 787 did (which is usually a good idea in the aviation industry), Airbus stuck to more traditional construction methods but added the use of carbon fibre. They also stuck with a more tradition system layout due to keeping bleed air systems.<br>On the surface of it the A350 appears to have had fewer headaches since implementation.>>><<<well, scientists love using the term supercritical.>>><<<Informative. Thank you>>><<<I usually have to take Degas to avoid bloating when travelling long distances on an aeroplane.>>><<<good and educational video. I have a question. what happens when it crashes? I know we shouldn&#39;t think negative but in case. as we know plane&#39;s aluminum bend and deform but does not shatter which in some cases saves the ppl inside during a crash like a car&#39;s crumple zones absorbing energy. what happens when there isn&#39;t anything to deform reducing the impact as much? Carbon Fibre is very brittle. it shatters on impact into millions bits. will it still have the property of absording impacts like Aluminum during a crash for a higher survival rate? if so, how? I know Formula 1 have still a cage on the feet area, during impact the Carbon Fibre is the absorbing factor and the cage stops it. is there anything like a cage in this plane?>>><<<Thank you for all you do. If you ever want to do the same type of show on privet jets. Please contact me.

So I just wonder how long it&#39;ll be before one of these go down. Then the report will read that somebody somewhere was aware of something... Nobody seems to question new stuff.

Boeing claimed in 2013 the plane was complete and held a major press conference with even the president attending. It was an OUTRIGHT LIE!!! Boeing wasn&#39;t even close to a working prototype! The production problems only continued when they hired the lowest bidders as contractors for EVERY PART OF THE PLANE!!! Realistically these contractors just couldn&#39;t make the working parts. Is it safe? Given what&#39;s happened with the 737 Max recently only a true fool would trust Boeing. Assuming it is safe the plane is still a disaster as even AirBus has realized in the last ten years that space age planes really don&#39;t make business sense.

[Current Assignee: Boeing Co.]<br><br>&quot;The door assembly may be fluidly connected to the laminar flow control system of the aircraft by a diffuser or other ducting such that when the first door is moved to the open position, the pores of the laminar flow control system may be purged by high pressure external flow captured by the first door and which may be ducted to the suction cavity for discharge through the pores. The discharge of flow through the pores may effectively remove contaminants such as liquid and/or debris that may be trapped in the pores [...]<br><br>When the first door is moved to the closed position and the second door is moved to the open position, a suction force may be generated in the suction cavity. In this regard, the opening of the second door may generate an external region aft of the second door that has an external pressure that is less than a cavity pressure within the suction cavity. The external pressure may result in the generation of the suction force within the suction cavity which may draw the external flow located proximate the porous skin through the pores and into the suction cavity. More specifically, the application of the suction force to the porous skin draws a portion of the boundary layer through the pores. As is know in the art, the drawing in or suctioning of the boundary layer may delay transition of the boundary layer to turbulent flow and may decrease skin friction drag.&quot;<br><br>The visible doors are both the outlet of the plumbing system (opening one way, with the scoop facing aft) to discharge the air that enters through the pores, and (presumably on approach) the method for clearing out the pores that have been clogged by dirt or debris by pressurizing the cavity underneath the skin with ram air ingested through the scoop.>>><<<BUT !

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. <br><br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.>>><<<I flew on an ANA 787 to Japan.

Now that they prefer recycling old designs, and cut corners, new breakthroughs like this are becoming less likely. Plus, the corporate culture is moving away from the boldness required to make huge steps forward like the 787 did for the whole industry. Boeing is stepping down from being a leader, to becoming a follower.<br>And this can even be felt in the 787&#39;s production line. Obviously, the plane is (too) costly, but rightly so. But now, with Boeing promoting at all costs their plan in the US South (even though they don&#39;t have the competence of the historic factory), and cutting corners in the manufacturing and quality control, even the reputation of the 787 is being tarnished. It had some troubles, yes, but they were coming from outsourced parts. Now, the troubles emanate from Boeing themselves. I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we soon heard of a crash of a 787 due to manufacturing problems by Boeing.>>><<<Imo, one of the most agreeable developments in the media has been that producers are less afraid of overwhelming the audience with highly technical information.

You can glamorize Boeing‚Äôs greatest achievements but the company as a whole has made an epic number of embarrassing mistakes and fails. Even early 787‚Äôs had issues with onboard fires that could haven been fatal to passengers. The Boeing that designed the 747 was a world class company.

OK yes, in theory, the bonding of the fuselage creates one BIG part, rather than a whole bunch of little parts put together. And that&#39;s a good thing. When it works. Meanwhile... Boeing has over 100 of these planes, completed, but undeliverable (yet). That&#39;s because they may have made mistakes when making that one big part, and now they have to strip them down completely (at a cost of millions per plane) to check if they need fixing. And Boeing doesn&#39;t want to do that, so they&#39;re negotiating the creation of a statistical analysis process, to predict (?) which areas of which planes, need fixing. That&#39;s actually quite interesting, but it&#39;s not a great advertisement for composites, to put it mildly.>>><<<fantastic engineering by American technology. world leader. good reason why others want to steal this technology. still Boeing will be ahead of others.>>><<<The engineering benefits from composites are obviously huge, but a major drawback (i think) is that they cant be recycled. I know, aluminium is alsoe very hard to reuse, but with carbon fibre it is virtually impossible. Every plane (and car, bike, shoe ...) made with carbon fibre is bound to end up as hazardous waste.

The front edge of the engine nacelles still use bleed air to heat and prevent or remove ice.<br><br>Also, just because the wing and tail system does not require engine bleed air this does not mean we can run it on the ground and not have to do traditional fluid based deicing.  The heated surface is just the leading edge, which is where ice typically begins forming in flight.

Having a supply chain spanning the entire world doesn&#39;t help. And the titanium slivers in the plane close to the crucial wires makes this plane a time bomb. 1% of the switches that control the emergency fire extinguishers don&#39;t work.

Still amazing though!>>><<<I love watching your videos. I probably shouldnt waste this much time but this was interesting üòÇ>>><<<Fantastic video thanks>>><<<787 max anyone?>>><<<The video is excellent on the engineering but inaccurate on the rest.<br><br>1) There isn&#39;t a radical market change. The Boeing 767 is around since 1980 and is a smaller long range aircraft than the 787. Any change the 787 is said to have brought around was possible since the 90s. If anything the 787 is actually worse for point to point service because it&#39;s a lot heavier and a bit bigger than the 767 it replaces (not the 777, the 777 is a lot larger than the 787 and is replaced by the 777X and the A350). The 787 sells because it&#39;s a good aircraft, not because it revolutionized the market or is an aircraft with specs not seen before. <br><br>2) The A350 is not a competitor to the 787 since it&#39;s a lot larger. The 787 competitor is the A330neo which despite being an aluminium plane sells almost as well as the 787 if you look at yearly sales these days.<br><br>3) Anti Ice systems are standard on modern airliners, it&#39;s not a new 787 feature.<br><br>4) The 787 wasn&#39;t the first to eliminate bleed air, the DC-8 did that too decades ago.>>><<<Okay, but do any of the commercial airliners have missile flares?<br>Amazing but I don&#39;t like how brittle carbon fiber is :/<br>How well can this plane fly when damaged, compared to it contemporary counterparts?>>><<<Literally just flew in one and was admired by the engines on the wings. They‚Äôre huuuge in person>>><<<This type of engineering makes rocket science look like a b**ch.>>><<<...<br>...<br>...<br><br><br>... Cairben Foibur>>><<<As the Italians say, &quot;Only love is stronger than carbon fibre&quot;.>>><<<If we are talking technology-wise then sure, but the 787 is not directly rivaled with the A350 but rather the A330. Similar size and utility.>>><<<Sorry to say, but the A350 kinda outsmarted the 787 as part of this &#39;new gen&#39; breed of engineering. The 787 entered service as a problematic aircraft and still stays this way till now, which the A350 doesn&#39;t suffer from.>>><<<This video quite literally summed up my last 4 years studying as an aerospace engineer.>>><<<This engineering was simply <i>inSANE!</i>>>><<<Well researched, well narrated, well edited and pedagogic. A solid red thread through the video but also relevant deep dives in the theory and history of the features utilized. Not too deep to lose momentum in the overall story but detailed enough to give context and explanation. I love the reference inclusion at precisely the right moments. Those moments you&#39;re likely (if you&#39;re just  bit critical to what you watch - and you always should be) to think: &quot;wait, what... that&#39;s a bold claim&quot;. <br><br>Thanks! Well done!<br><br>And the beauty right now? I have 786 comments on the counter when pressing &quot;Comment&quot;-button... ;)>>><<<I wonder if the next part will include the autopilot failures of boeing.>>><<<It feels like you&#39;ve just told me that Boeing has invented Heisenberg Compensators.>>><<<If it wasn&#39;t because of your videos a lot of people wouldn&#39;t have known how much engineering goes into making such a complex machine>>><<<So Boeing and other companies knows how to save fuel and there fore could share knowledge to reduce pollution but they keep it in secret.. Karma is real no wonder why Boeing suffered from BIG fails when their planes crashed..>>><<<Will you do the same for A350?>>><<<The main thing I don&#39;t like about the 787 is the window tint system and the way the cabin crew can override and lock out the seat controls.<br><br>It would be nice if Boeing shifted production back to Seattle. That way there would be fewer problems being found with completed aircraft coming from SC. You would think that after 10 years, the North Charleston plant would have ironed out the final assembly problems, not get worse.>>><<<There&#39;s no Mt Olympus in Washington state, lived here my whole life. Maybe your thinking of the Olympic mountains. And no one really goes up there so know one even knows much about them>>><<<Can&#39;t imagine I&#39;m getting smarter all because I learned English through video game 11 years ago (so I can watch all of these advanced documentary from first world country and learn from them).>>><<<As someone whose sole job is to market the 787 and a former aerospace engineer, I am beyond impressed. Not only at the simple explanations of complex systems and concepts, but the resourcefulness to get all the videos/images/documents that I myself have trouble finding at times. The 1 hour Nebula was well worth it as well. <br><br>Two noteworthy systems incorporated on the 787 that didn‚Äôt make it in the video are MLA (maneuver load alleviation) which reduces the loads experienced on the wing through the use of flight controls + spoilers and TEVC (trailing edge variable camber) where the wing camber is varied to improve drag. <br><br>Superb job!>>><<<Suck on that A350!>>><<<a fantastic jet in about 10 years for sure. Just a shame they locked it&#39;s early career success behind the &quot;swan dive&quot; DLC from Boeing.>>><<<Great stuff I work on these daily as an aircraft technician. Always something new to learn about this plane. <br><br>BTW are you Supereyepatchwolf?>>><<<Serious shade thrown in this video!>>><<<Thank you!>>><<<I am waiting for similar video about the 777-8/9 (X)>>><<<Brian: You need to do more editing on your videos as you are using the wrong words to describe crucial details. I have noticed this in the last two videos and the Part 2 of this video I watched on Curiosity. On the extreme braking test, you described it as an &quot;aborted landing&quot;; it is an aborted take-off. <br>As an aside, there&#39;s no such thing as an aborted landing, it&#39;s referred to as a go-around or balked approach. Sometimes &quot;aborted landing&quot; is used to describe a crash landing.>>><<<I remember first reading about the 787 and how excited I was for that (mostly just the carbon fiber body), but I had NO idea how much more advanced it was. <br><br>Absolutely amazing. Sadly though, I&#39;ll likely never get a chance to fly on one (due to where I travel for vacations, very regional airlines)>>><<<I think from memory, a large part of the fact that the early airliners were so expensive was not just because of the tooling and production, but also because they had to pay quite a lot of penalties to ANA for the aircraft being a few tons overweight, something which wasn&#39;t helped when they had to put the batteries in a steel box to prevent lithium-ion thermal runaway. Great video, I love the 787, the A350 is a lovely aircraft as well, but it lacks the effortless grace and innovation of the 787. Unfortunately, the 787 is slightly tainted for me now because of the political ramifications it had in Boeing which ultimately led to the Max being built.>>><<<Funded by Boeing. Obviously.>>><<<TRIVIA: The Small Doors on the Stabilizers were already removed on recent versions of 787. Due to High Failure Rate and Maintenance costs. They just used the &quot;Vacuum Effect&quot; (IDK the correct term) to expel the air that is sucked in by the &quot;Small Holes&quot;>>><<<Let‚Äôs goooo another R.E. vid!>>><<<You know it&#39;s a great video when after 30 minutes of watching you&#39;re sad and surprised it&#39;s over because you thought only 10 minutes had passed... Very well done!>>><<<This is a great video and definitely worth watching the Nebula version>>><<<I was studying aviation electronics and was asked why plane flies?<br>one of the answers can be &quot;oh you know different speed air on/under the wing creates lift&quot;<br>or &quot;if plane speed is high enough and attack angle....&quot;<br>i think most accurate is this &quot;planes fly because of money if there were no money nobody cared about aerodynamics nor improvements of it&quot;>>><<<The animation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapFQl6RezA&amp;t=813">13:33</a> shows the &#39;over&#39; and &#39;under&#39; flows transiting the wing in equal time, which is not what happens in reality.>>><<<Excellent educational video!>>><<<‚ÄúLaminar flow‚Äù<br><br>Somewhere a wild Destin perks up>>><<<really great job on this>>><<<Learn to speak English and how to pronounce &#39;composite&#39;.<br>composite: [KOM] + [PUH] + [ZIT] - say it out loud and exaggerate the sounds until you can consistently produce them.>>><<<Doesn&#39;t full piece sections mean it&#39;s impossible to repair?

During a low velocity crash, it was known that aluminum had a few minutes of resistance to fire which is why passengers have 90 seconds to evacuate an aircraft. While carbon doesn&#39;t burn, the resins do and can give of toxic smoke-worse than aluminum skin.<br><br>Since one of these composite aircraft have crashed or caught fire, survival time is only a guesstimate...>>><<<I would have liked to see some info about its greenhouse gases load in relation to more traditional designs.>>><<<The reference to conor mcgregor is a OOF.>>><<<How is carbon fiber recycled?>>><<<I like that the only ratio you care about is Aspect ratio.>>><<<Seriously the amount of research put into  this video is amazing. Great work and thanks for making this video.>>><<<Thanks for this. I learned so much from this deep but elementary engineering explanation. Grateful to know more about the carbon composite material used. And I can certainly appreciate -- and I celebrate -- Boeing&#39;s willingness to roll the dice on the 787. It is a marvelously beautiful aircraft, both in architecture and engineering. But then I question the company&#39;s willingness to roll the dice when it comes to cutting costs on protecting the aircraft from lightning strikes. How much could the thin strips of copper and insulation on those bolts really cost? I don&#39;t work in the industry, so I honestly don&#39;t know. But it sounds like a cut coming after a cut... coming after a cut. I do get that filling the tanks with a non-combustible gas is a safeguard against explosion. But whatever happened to the notion that, when miles above the earth, it&#39;s a good idea to double-up on safety when you can? So if engineers know that attaching copper strips to the wings will neutralize lightning strikes -- and we know the extensive damage lightning can do to the aircraft (as the video points out) -- and we know that lightning strikes are not an infrequent occurrence in aviation -- I am curious as to Boeing&#39;s risk/benefit calculation.>>><<<Oustanding video, thank you!>>><<<Cant wait the engine video.

Hence the unintentional second meaning of &quot;insane&quot; in the clickbait.  Despite the gorgeous I guess Irish voiceover.  Trying to imagine what one of those ovens does to the environment.  What is it, like seven, maybe eight percent of people alive have ever flown?  The other 92% have to pay the health and environmental costs for their extravagance.  Really only about three percent of humans doing this regularly.  Socialize the costs to everyone else, all the humans, all the animals.  Who cares, right?  Endless downwind costs of these dirty industries.  I too have loved engined flight in my time, but it embarrasses me now that I participated in such a dirty way of being in the world.  We have giant sail tankers than can do a decent twelve miles an hour.  Humans can do that.  It&#39;s time to ground all airlines.  If we wish to fly, put a rogallo wing in a backpack, climb a mountain, and jump.

Many people don&#39;t realise what a step forward the 787 was in terms of technologies employed.

I work for a major engine manufacturer, and I can tell you, eliminating the bleeds and having over half a megawatt of electrical generation capability certainly had some &#39;interesting&#39; consequences!

Early on, airlines sent them back finding, among other things, random junk left inside panels, avionics bays and fuel tanks. More recently, under FAA scrutiny, multiple new issues with manufacturing have shown up. Would be interesting to do a video on what they‚Äôve done to improve the leadership culture since the 737 MAX scandal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgDHC1Rx-2Q">https://youtu.be/fgDHC1Rx-2Q</a>>>><<<Spent 5 years manufacturing the nacelle components for this plane.

However, I cannot believe how the very same Boeing who designed 777&#39;s workspace also designed 787&#39;s interior and workspace. Comparing to 777, it just sucks... Free space, storage space, ergonomics... All worse than 777, except automated windows, bigger overhead bin space per passenger, and better air conditioning. Being smaller than 777 doesn&#39;t justify its interior design flaws. We can see how better it can be when we look at A350 for example.>>><<<Is this the same plane with MCAS issues?>>><<<where is the 4k quali?>>><<<Literally like every aerospace engineer at my college watches this channel religiously.

Incredible>>><<<RANDOM MCGREGGOR DIG>>><<<So you&#39;re tellimg me that we could hypothetically make a composite material from human, based on it having similar characteristics to carbon fibre. Albeit definitely not as strong or even close. However, I wonder if anyone knows if it&#39;s possible. ü§îü§î>>><<<Naaah not realy , the 737 and the A320 has actually revolutionised travel , the 787 has only merely replaced 767 and A330 , while making a profit for the airlines , there are only a handful of airlines who use it as was advertised by boeing.>>><<<From what I remember rivets don‚Äôt create any bumps on aircraft fuselage>>><<<Fun fact about the 787: If you don&#39;t restart it for 248 days, all power generator control units will enter failsafe mode simultaneously, leading to complete loss of power and hence loss of control. Presumably this is due to integer overflow, since 2^31 1/100 seconds ~ 248 days.>>><<<So the 787 has titanium fasteners that are potentially vulnerable to fatigue cracking early in their life (let me guess that FAA approval was pre-2020?) and the wings are now more vulnerable to lightning strikes. <br><br>Just that these days Boeing engineers saying a cost cutting measure is safe doesn‚Äôt inspire a huge amount of confidence.>>><<<Great video.

I&#39;m an airline pilot and the bleed free systems is incredibly intriguing to me.

It still only protects the leading edges. In traditional planes, ground idle on the engines is indeed only enough for cabin air conditioning; it can&#39;t optimally heat the wings. But the biggest issue is that freezing precipitation falls ONTO the plane, coating everything including the upper wing surfaces which are not protected. By virtue of high speed flight through weather, heating only the leading edge is necessary for flight.
