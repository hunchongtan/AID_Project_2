Students in our school don&#39;t come from a school bus and most of us go by mtr and u have to walk a bit since not everyone&#39;s home is near the mtr. It was so rainy and I didn&#39;t have a raincoat on and I only had an umbrella. I didn&#39;t expect it to be that windy and stuff so I only brought a normal small umbrella but 5 minutes outside and that umbrella broke, anyways I threw it away and went into a mall for cover since I still had to go to the mtr and waited for the rain to lessen. The rain eventually lessened and I RAN so fast into the mtr and luckily I wasn&#39;t too soaked. I still had to walk from the mtr to school but I didn&#39;t have an umbrella. But even on a normal day, the area near my school is pretty windy so it was ULTRA MAX EXTREMELY windy. People stood inside the mtr for shelter cus the people outside looked like they were abt to fly away frm the wind and thankfully my friend was there with a huge umbrella. Both of us shared it but it was so windy, even her gigantic umbrella went inside out. She had a raincoat, boots and a thing to cover her backpack. Mean while I had nothing so I just ran again. And my school has two zebra crossings that&#39;s traffic lights take one whole minute each before turning green so I took a whole shower there. I was soaked af when I reached school and my hair was like dripping along with my uniform and schoolbag.

While this video is 7 years old,  I have noticed that many online publications rate this $30 umbrella extremely high.  Could it be because it&#39;s easier to sell a $30 product,  which is widely available at various stores compared to a higher end umbrella for snooty people to walk from the exit of a large building to a cab or limo?  I mean really, is an umbrella the best thing for high winds?  You&#39;re essentially becoming a sailor.  It probably makes more sense to invest in a good raincoat but expect to be stuffy.  Those breathable raincoats rely on some kind of light water repellent finish that comes off in the wash or with wear.  Don&#39;t forget the safety glasses if you really want to walk around in high winds.  Scratch cornea is the worst pain you will ever experience.  Hard hat makes sense too.>>><<<You sold me. Buying mine now>>><<<Really?! This is impressive as hell. You subjected this to a sustained turbulent wake coming off your car. The anomemeter was likely understating wind speed based on where it was. Unless you&#39;re a freak, your hand would have let go by now and you&#39;d be struggling to walk.>>><<<Is this guy serious, 🤣.   You only proved how durable these things really are!  Also, the wind should blow the other way, 😆. Like, waiting for a semi 🚚 truck to speed by.  To see if it could withstand a gust of wind going &quot;up underneath.&quot; 🤔.   That was a waste of time, sir.  A total waste of time, hahahah>>><<<Because of this video i will buy 10 of these. Thank you. ✌️>>><<<I have one and I have no desire testing it in a hurricane so yes it works just fine for normal use>>><<<wow>>><<<Please do more video like these.>>><<<Um. Thanks?  Now lets seat an elephant on a backyard swingset to test durability? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23unattainableexpectations">#unattainableexpectations</a>>>><<<does it blow up if held normally ? need to see if it turns inside out>>><<<I didn&#39;t know Joe Satriani did umbrella wind tests.>>><<<What the fuck did I just watch? I guess you cant drag this behind a car at 50 MPH. Dang>>><<<Ok ! You wasn’t kidding around!>>><<<Thanks. Looks like it withstood very well. Thumbs up to the brand! What I am really curious about is whether it can avoid flipping within reasonable wind speeds.>>><<<Lmaooo savage test, two thumbs up from me 👍👍>>><<<Next up testing bulletproof vests....shoots 50bmg followed by antitank rounds...nope not bulletproof>>><<<Worthless review.>>><<<By the test, the Repel Umbrella performs extremely WELL - above Any Other - It is ILLOGICAL to think that an umbrella can stand winds of 40+ speed!! His expectations are absurd. This guy should design an umbrella made of STEEL for himself.>>><<<Nice test. Check out Doppler/Knirps BMW windtunels tests.>>><<<If you&#39;re out in 60mph winds I really think an umbrella not lasting a minute should be the least of your concerns>>><<<Actually, this is pretty impressive to me; it&#39;s a beautiful umbrella, and I doubt I&#39;ll be walking in 40 mph winds.>>><<<this is actually fairly impressive.>>><<<Good video but doesn&#39;t simulate gusts. Even the leading brands tested up to 60mph probably wouldn&#39;t resist 60 mph of constant resistance at one angle.>>><<<I think your bar is a bit too high for &quot;wind proof&quot;, who&#39;s gonna be outside 45 mph winds. Plus, the way people hold an umbrella in the rain cause the wind to attack from the umbrella&#39;s underside. Your test imposed high aerodynamic stress on the umbrella&#39;s outside, which is stress it may not have been designed to handle at the magnitudes tested in your video.>>><<<Next time I&#39;m riding on the outside of a car on the parkway I&#39;ll remember not to use my Repel umbrella. Silly test.>>><<<Very informative 🤗🤗>>><<<I idea>>><<<Thank you!>>><<<Bad luck to open an umbrella in a indoor room 😊>>><<<Poor after-sales service, no reply>>><<<Dude you are closing it the hard way, place your hand on top and push down.>>><<<An account named Salvatore Siddiq is reposting your videos.

Handle is a little too small especially if you have problems in  the wrist.>>><<<Great review>>><<<Good review man! Thanks for that 👊🏽>>><<<Great review- looked this up to make sure I understood the opening mechanism>>><<<I don’t recommend this product at all, even tho it supposedly has a lifetime warranty I wouldn’t expect it to break so quickly for how much I paid yet mine broke and now I have to go through the hassle of getting it repaired when it shouldn’t have broken in the first place.>>><<<Wherever you end up purchasing, take a very close look at your umbrella. I ordered mine from Walmart in total black; it came with &quot;Blue Sky&quot; underneath. The umbrella I received was the correct brand, but it was not at all &quot;double-vented.&quot; That tell-tale band that the vented umbrellas have? Yeah, not there at all. It was simply a well-made, normal travel umbrella; not something for which you&#39;d spend $30. So. Either someone couldn&#39;t read an order form (possible), or someone thought I wouldn&#39;t notice.>>><<<Auto close is not working 1st day>>><<<Thanks for the review, was checking out the umbrella on their website and had to watch a review to see if it was legit!>>><<<Is there spf for this>>><<<Mine broked at the plastic joint after few use.>>><<<This Youtube Channel is so underated. Deserve more visibility.>>><<<Nobody ever tests them out side, I  wonder why 😂😂>>><<<Good review, explained key feature well thanks.>>><<<This is a great review and made me feel more comfortable of ordering a couple of these off of Amazon. <br>I just had to add a remark that I&#39;ve never seen an umbrella which is not waterproof. A non waterproof umbrella could be real funny.>>><<<I really admire how hard you work on your YouTube channel. You’re an inspiration. Keep it up! You’re heading for great things soon enough.>>><<<😍😎✨👏👍🚙🚌✈🌎>>><<<Solid umbrella for the price. Materials will start to break down at around the two year mark along with some visible rust along the arms. I’m on my third one now but the first two still function. Just with some issues.>>><<<Very good Umbrella, quality made!>>><<<Tired of crappy umbrellas, so thank you for this! Much appreciated!>>><<<I’ve had mine since 2019. (same company). It’s my main umbrella with no complaints.>>><<<One thing I hate with the automatic umbrellas is that you may accidentally press the button which closes the umbrella entirely. I hate this so much.>>><<<BS>>><<<I still remember the boxter oil change video I found you from. Stay at it brother!>>><<<HEY EVERYONE THIS IS BEAT THE BUSHDZEIOFJH ZOQI FOZQIJ<br>Damn this is an absolute unit of an umbrella>>><<<oh yea I have an umbrella like this, I heard from reviews that you might get leaks (during heavy rain) due to the vents in the umbrella, though I havent tried using it since it&#39;s my back up umbrella until my current umbrella breaks, which has lasted me 7+ years so far, its a bit worn down but still works fine>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYKRV6BjLXA&amp;t=96">1:36</a> u explained this all very well. Materials and feel are just as important ss aesthetics and functionality. Thank you❤>>><<<Great umbrella, I&#39;ve been using this brand for years. I never got to try the unconditional warranty as I lost 3 of them already 😂>>><<<Very. informative. I now have the information to determine my purchase.>>><<<Thanks this is exactly what i need Good quality well thoughtout product>>><<<I don&#39;t see the clip on the handle so this isn&#39;t the solo. It would have to be the duet...but you said the diameter ranges 45 to 48 inches. The duet is 55 inches. What on earth is this thing? Is this a discontinued model from several years ago?>>><<<Great umbrella, thanks for the test.>>><<<$159, worth it?  I&#39;m 5-7, 140 would this be too big?>>><<<I love my Davek! The lifetime warranty is excellent!>>><<<Great review that was well organized, to the point, well demonstrated with visuals, and professionally produced like channels many times larger than yours. You deserve more subs, and you earned a sub today. Thank you for the effort you put into this video.>>><<<Awesome umbrella but I cannot see myself spending $160. Maybe if I win the lottery! lol>>><<<Wow umbrella 150 bucks is so expensive. These umbrella should have included free WiFi, gps included, weather report and other. I can’t believe it cost so much. It is hard to tell umbrellas cost 20 dollars vs 150 dollars. If you ask people in the street and sell it in the store.>>><<<Did you just repost this umbrella video.
