<<<you need to be online with it that is one way of them accessing information like face scans to be sent back to china for evaluation i have lack of trust when electronics ask to be on line amp ask for more personal details before you can use it >>><<<they are locking up these devices to their stores games controllers vr should be open platform so you can buy controllers including specialty gun like for any device you should also be able to play steam vr games regardless of your vr headset if they do not standardize these things vr is not going to be popular at leas nowhere near as popular as regular consoles >>><<<the middle fingers that is the real test>>><<<did not apple copy these guys >>><<<who also checked his steam inbox 7 19 >>><<<hi this head set have some sort of lag in games in wireless mode i buyed reverb g2 and sell it a few months ago because the lenses become blurry after minutes of use >>><<<highly reluctant to give facebook my hard earned cash made my mind up pico 4 it is great review mate >>><<<what about the quest 3 the quest 3 has full colour past through and no fish eye small controllers so you do not clash them together and the headset is so much smaller so it is so much more portable to take around >>><<<so let me do the math here regarding the controllers after a quick google search you can see that a double a battery has a capacity of 1800 to 2700mah at 1 5v let is be realistic and land on a 2400mah battery for a very decent one an economical 18650 lithium ion battery that has a great capacity is the samsung 35e or something 3500mah at 3 6v so 1 5 2400 3 6wh 3 6 3500 12 6wh so say you are a dedicated gamer you play vr games for more than 10 hours per week every week you will have to pay about 4dollar for batteries at the end of the first year will have paid more than 200dollar maybe even 250dollar for batteries d how much is a samsung 35e 3dollar  6dollar for two controllers so why do not they put 18650s in there weight no 2 aa batteries is 46grams 1 18650 is 48grams xd charging controller and type c port literally 1dollar or less manufacturing cost  so why environmental concerns surely after 200 batteries thrown in your trash per year this is not realistic  so  i rest my case they are just stupid they do not get that 4 aa batteries for the two controllers is a considerable expense if they are used frequently >>><<<good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life >>><<<reasons why to not get the pico 4 you can not play gorilla tag on it theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100dollar while pico costs 430dollar and its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can not do anything about it>>><<<hi i am planning to buy this one i would like to ask how harmful it is for the eyes and neck >>><<<thank you my friend for the detailed explanation but you forgot to talk about screen resolution when watching movies >>><<<bruh this is like meta stealing picos style>>><<<does the pico 4 pro have eye and face tracking im unsure on this>>><<<so the quest 3 but objectivally worse>>><<<is it compatible with ps5 >>><<<quest 2 quest 3 quest pro pico 4>>><<<i am looking at getting one but need to know what it is like if you wear glasses also is it good for watching films and tv >>><<<just got one as my first headset really good but the standalone games are actually terrible so i use it with steam if i knew i would only use it with steam i probably would have saved up for a bit longer probably would have gone mad waiting for a headset and gotten a valve index even though it is heavy or a bigscreen when it comes out maybe even a quest 3 since it is lighter but not as balanced >>><<<whts the pico library now for games and apps>>><<<does pico vr pc connect require a good pc or it runs on pico>>><<<i purchased a local chinese copy and want to use it in africa is it possible that i will encounter problems while downloading games and updating the system >>><<<do not get why people giving such hate on the built in audio it was 10x better then what all the reviews are saying about it standalone games library is still poor tho 12 months after release and no mod support for games like contractors kinda sucks plus still no pavlov shack >>><<<thanks for saying what the company making this also makes >>><<<it actually has gorilla tag >>><<< >>><<<love pico but wavy lenses >>><<< 14 21 >>><<<publisher is bytedance hence i do not recommend this headset research the actions they have committed

games on it>>><<<i just want anything thats not oculus they give me so many issues and can not fix a single one my headset has become a brick>>><<< nope none of that china garbage facebook bad china worse bytedance can suck it >>><<<nahhh tic tac>>><<<what is a good vr headset budget friendly to connect to laptops for adult content thanks >>><<<sell your data to the zucc or to china pick your poison i just want a standalone vr headset that i can start using without any accounts and that doesnt have yet another proprietary software store that requires developers to support it creating yet another ecosystem but works seamlessly with all vr games out of the box regardless of where they were purchased  something like an android for vr>>><<<no thanks i am not putting my hard earned dollars into chinese owned competition >>><<<my pico 4 is coming tomorrow i will try it with wire and then try to swap to wifi then perhaps i shall buy a dedicated router anyhow i am happy to join vr playerbase>>><<<n o genuinly that ipd motor is far better than doing manually it is usefull >>><<<there is a split audio and charger adapter>>><<<not compatible with quest games period >>><<<so if i install virtual desktop i could play all the quest games on the pico 4 headset >>><<<i just ordered these for myself i am interested using the built in games and steam vr thank you for the review video >>><<<great review do i need a specialized link cable or any usb c to usb cable will do it seems quest uses the same type of cable also would a quest cable work then thanks >>><<<really pico 4 is just trash bro>>><<<how is this not the same os as oculus am i tripping>>><<<how much does virtual desktop cos aud >>><<<im pretty sure that you had a yellow dot because when you expose your lenses to the suns it basicly kills the pixels>>><<<how did you record a dead pixel >>><<<is this headset able to work as a monitor as in could you plug it into your computer and watch or play something like cyberpunk >>><<<zkxdokd>>><<<owned by the chinese communist party that is all i needed to know thanks >>><<<not gonna lie this headset in my opinion is head on against the quest 2 and if improved will 100percent be better >>><<<i have owned both headsets before and i prefer the pico 4 a lot more than the quest 2 at this point it is just the better choice >>><<<it would be nice to see developer port the quest 2 firmware to pico 4>>><<<a great alternative of spending all of your money on one thing>>><<<ps vr 2>>><<<thank you man very positive and informative thank you dear >>><<<were you paid to leave this review >>><<<pico from fnf>>><<<so how about a more recent video 6 months in which is the better one>>><<<terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2>>><<<forget handbreak steam vr what is about performance pusher open xr >>><<<quest2 2 0 >>><<<does anyone notice this looks like the ready player one vr headset>>><<<is it better the then the quest or is it the best vr>>><<<would really love to see an update video on this headset to see if they fixed most of your problems with it >>><<<my nick name is pico  i am so surprised to see this  i am real >>><<<it is funny to think how much money meta lost raising the price of the quest 2>>><<<i need to crack down on my unnecessary spending so i can save up for a vr hedset right now the pico 4 is at the top of my list but by christmas i might spot something different that is still under dollar1 000 >>><<<question can one buy this but not let tiktok collect your information seeing its owned by bydance ccp spy company can it be used off there grid with there spy collections softer ware >>><<<and that is what i call a beautiful design>>><<<thanks for the review ten hag ggmu >>><<<advanced beat saber players beware considering the pico4 for playing everything expert on beat saber tldr forget it  long version  if you use the pico streaming assistant either over wifi or over usbc and you crank up the video settings to the max the image quality is still inferior to a valve index because it is blurry lower the settings and it becomes more blurry no matter how it is blurry despite the pancake lenses personally i prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect as on the index than a blurry image without some say the pico streamer app is compressing the video too much who knows whatever the limitation is it sucks  so if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you will need to use virtual desktop virtual desktop consists of 2 parts an app on the pico and a streamer app on your pc but there is a but virtual desktop is streamer app wants to go over wifi only there used to be workarounds involving tethering over usb but after the last firmware update they do not work anymore the workaround involved installing an android app apk which allowed you to access all of the pico is hidden settings besides it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up tons of forums to read on reddit hard to get right on the first try and you had to enable the settings on the pico and on your pc every time before playing uggh if with your previous headset you used to just start vr and play this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker  but now for the major deal breaker the controllers omg these controllers are so bad for playing beat saber it is worse if you have big hands their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and secure grip you end up clicking buttons all the time while playing and you know what that does the plastic is super slippery when playing fast they will slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed do not even think of playing any camellia map when you see youtubers play beat saber with them they all play very slowly clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming the tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play it works but it will ruin your pp  for the rest i found the face mask to be very uncomfortable compared to a valve index but i guess ymmv and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and do not let light in from the sides  i returned my pico4 after less than a week of daily use the poor image quality due to the streaming limitations and the slippery un ergonomic inaccurate controllers made me do so >>><<<what games can you not play on the pico that you can on the quest>>><<<its like meta quest pro>>><<<pico 4 is gt gt gt gt gt gt gt psvr just for that middle finger>>><<<so its a quest 2 but worse >>><<< 14 27 interesting subliminal message >>><<<should i get quest 2 or pico 4>>><<<is the pico 4 able to run adobe medium >>><<<one of the reasons sony apparently went with fresnel on psvr2 was the amount of light it could passthrough vs pancake lenses wanting hdr is why they went with fresnel they claimed >>><<<headset like momentum 4 can do around 60 hours of playing music now i know a vr headset would be more power hungry but i bet the battery can be improved to at least 10 15 hours 2 3 is too little in my opinion>>><<<your dog is so cute >>><<<i play sim racing games and microsoft flight simulator would the pico 4 be suitable >>><<<i have quest 2 and watching this shit>>><<<the pico 4 is a total game changer >>><<<i bet you do not have to have a fb account to get it to work >>><<<what is the point of making the ui almost identical to

just want to say it is great to have a channel like this you do such a great job on reviews and i just want to ask you a question as far as today is right now which do you think is the best headset right now in 2023 >>><<< 13 20 thats so retarded lol why no headphone jack >>><<<geekvr has a nice face cover makes the pico 4 look even smaller>>><<<by competition you mean it smashes it right the quest 3 will basically be this >>><<<hey i have a littel problem with my pico 4 the pov of my pico dous not look like the one he shows insted mine is pixelated>>><<<maybe it is quest killer but first it is quest copy>>><<<why are they not selling this in the us did pico ever give a statement on that >>><<<my pc is connected to the internet via lan is it possible to use virtual desktop with a router while being connected to the internet via lan >>><<<creator of tiktok ok i will pass >>><<<can you use pico 4 with gt7 >>><<<its a good entry point but as soon as someone says i need to have an account for a physical device its a no go for me >>><<<why are people not putting headphone jacks on their devices first the reverb g1 and g2 and now the pico 4 >>><<<i can not wait to be able to use one of these vrs to watch porn videos maybe with a sucker included to act as a vagina or oral cavity who knows how many boys will also try the gay version while we are at it >>><<<in my opinion the biggest flaws the pico 4 has are that the handtracking doesnt really work for me at least and the game library isnt great so far there are even some games that entirely just do not work like ruinsmagus also it just feels like sometimes the games get really pixelated and low res but on the other hand i got nothing to compare as this is my first vr headset>>><<<is hitman vr in epic games launcher compatible with the pico 4 >>><<<frackin ell mike you have come a long way in a short time your vids are unreal great review mate keep up the good work thank you>>><<<how does the recline

alternative for quest 2 and better visual experience more than rest thanks for review buddy >>><<<i wouldnt buy this its another tech giant from communist china to gain all your personal info>>><<< 10 52 can you do this test between the pro and pico 4 i just want an upgrade for immersed and i would go with the pico 4 >>><<<since it does not have the audio jack i do have the baseus usb type c to audio jack and type c port adapter it will not work on my samsung phone so it was such a waste but will it work for pico 4 >>><<<im geting a power link kabel compo from amazon>>><<< 2 25 already they did something better than quest>>><<<everyone here because they got one for christmas >>><<<maybe no if they are the same company that owns tik tok then they are going to have creative ways to steal your info and record you i am aware that facebook does that stuff too but there are easy ways to solve those problems on the quest >>><<<did we ever hear back from pico about that dead pixel i am interested to see how their customer service dealt with your issue>>><<<i have a quest 2 and the only thing that would keep me from buying the pico 4 is the lack of a headphone jack>>><<<thanks for the review is the screen door effect still there >>><<<one is manufacturing and other is during sale>>><<<10 15 or 15 10 or 15 15>>><<<bought a pico 4 today it seems ok but kind of baffled that it did not feel that different from the old first version of oculus except that the text in the sweetspot was way sharper could also be that in the headsett it just don t actually use the higher res but the other thing is that it felt like i was looking through a binocular is the screens to far away or is it just the way it is don t remember it being like that in oculus menaing that i notice the corners i do know that pico is round to the sides and not the others that i am aware of though i do like that the sweet spot is overall bigger making it a bit easier with headaches and such >>><<<i can not even consider an alternative unless there is the ability to work virtually like i can on the quest with horizon workroom and immersedvr >>><<<might finally upgrade from my oculus rift hope my router can keep up with the streaming bandwidth though >>><<<def happy that it has better fov than quest 2 while also being easier to read text i always feel like things being blurry from afar and the tunnel vision being the two most discomforting things in vr still wish in the future that they will somehow be able to pack even more fov into these things without sacrificing on sizwe though human eyes do have around 180 fov when looking around so it is a shame that currently we can only get just above half of that >>><<<but does not virtual desktop destroy some of the 3d sensation i e is not it more like playing on a flat screen >>><<<i need helo should i buy the quest 2 or pico for i do not know now bc at first i wanted to buy the quest 2 now idk>>><<<good review thanks i was looking for an alternative to meta quest as i do not want to have a meta facebook account which i will be forced to have from january 2023 when meta will effectively brick my quest does the pico have a browser >>><<<the build quality looks so much better than quest 2>>><<<can you play gorilla tag    >>><<<finally replacing my oculus quest 1>>><<<no one talks about how horrible the lenses are on pico 4 is the ghosting on these things is horrible and also the screen door effect is awful the battery life is horrendous totally not an upgrade more like a sidegrade do not buy if you have a quest 2 you will not be satisfied with the upgrade >>><<<the software looks exactly like quest>>><<<i am going to wait until summer before deciding on what next headset to buy i am eager to get away from oculus but i would like to keep my existing pcvr game library on there i was planning on the quest3 because i imagine it will be much more affordable than the pro but if the pico 4 is a solid competitor then i might just settle for it we will see what meta has to offer if they have anything to offer by summertime otherwise it is likely going to be the pico4 and for my existing oculus library i will just be running revive i guess >>><<<any wireless vr can beat the quest 2 especially the pico 4>>><<<when tiktok does better than meta themselves >>><<<pico 4 has extra tracking devices to track all body parts >>><<<can you play any game >>><<< 00 18 what is the thing on the glass and where can i get it >>><<<hi thanks for the review i do not have a pc but a chromebook is there a way to get the pico up to date how about netflix is there an app for netflix is it the same or better than oculus i have to be honest i am not a gamer i only use vr headsets to watch movies on big screen are youtube and prime also available >>><<<the headset may be great on paper or if you get a unit that is not faulty i received a unit with heavy lens distortion there is more and more threads on discord and reddit showing up on this issue it seems that pico released batches to market with faulty lenses in my case this caused severe nausea had to return >>><<<i just do not think it is worth it it is basically a copy of the oculus especially the software compare it side by side oculus may even be able to sue it is insane >>><<<i play a lot of il 2 sturmovik vr and i want to buy a new vr headset as my current set rift s is too low res to spot or id planes from any distance would you recommend the pico for this or is there another headset that would be better that isnt too expensive >>><<<what a lovely little dog what a star videos are always better with a dog >>><<<my quest is really messed up so this will be a good buy for me>>><<< 4 32 rest assured that in the headset it runs at a ismooth 72fps tfw motion sickness>>><<< 13 44 i can not even tell a difference if i did not buy the index a few days ago i would have gotten this>>><<<biggest issue for me is the game library and software and also there are not accessories to fix that headset that does not have the top part which would be uncomfortable it is a hard pass for me >>><<<so with using the pico 4 with the virtual desktop i have got a gtx 1070 8gb which isnt exactly bad but i am wondering whether it then fully depends on your pc hardware or only vr or both because i do not want to lack in the graphical department because of the 1070 any help would be appreciated >>><<<newbie here d may i know if this works with fallout 4 vr in stereo mode or does it work in stereo with normal fallout 4 asking cos of the controllers vs mouse keyboard thanks >>><<<have you tried turning the brightness down i know is counter intuitive but apparently it controls the white balance more than actual brightness that would be more a gamma the colours should improve also like this >>><<<seems like this is not available in the states >>><<<the fact the tik tok guys made this is such a heart breaking deal breaker fuck genuinely had interest in it>>><<<dude now we have another portable vr console where games need to be specifically ported to this nonsense is getting out of hand the market is totally split i am ignoring all this and waiting for standalone headsets like valve is deckard that will hopefully be open platform and out of the box compatible with pc vr games closed systems can buzz off with these the vr market is not going to get anywhere >>><<<half life on epic games store do not you mean full life nope myopia >>><<<does it run vrchat >>><<<thank you for letting me know the chinese company bytedance made the pico

review i currently use a quest 2 but only for flight sims via pcvr the problem is my ipd is somewhere around 75mm and the quest 2 is only just useable for me there is always some blurring in one or both eyes which gets very tiring over a long period i tried an hp reverb but that was even worse wonder if there is anywhere i can try a pico 4 before parting with my money >>><<<2160x2160 is not

out the us which is a big market for vr i have had people tell me that they will import it but pico said if you try to access their pico home and store on the headset it will not work so unfortunately i can not see it as an alternative to any quest products >>><<<i will wait for the quest 3 announced to be released next year >>><<<when are you getting the quest pro >>><<<am i on something or does

party is headset a headset designed to steal all your data>>><<<hi can you run oculus exclusive titles via pcvr when i try and run loan echo in the pico 4 i get an error steam title run great on virtual desktop >>><<<try getting a double adapter that has headphone jack and a usb port>>><<<looks great i like how the headset is smaller has full color passthrough for the same price as quest 2 but the software looks like they copied the ui of quest 2 to the dot >>><<<i wish they could send those to the us for us to try it >>><<<look this vr the pico 4 someone has to fina a way to put custom games like lightsaber and other meta owned games cuz i caant do a vr play session without those games honestly or meta has to make a contract with pico i guess someone please find the way>>><<<i do not know what oasis does to do it but he makes me feel excited and way more immersed when he does reviews almost as if i was there>>><<<pico 4 is cool but quest pro is better>>><<<i have the quest 2 and am not going to get another headset because tbh the games are pretty trash right now and the quest 2 is super uncomfortable but i can see why this new one might be better but just seems like a waste of money to buy this one too specially when there arnt a lot of changes and even the quest 2 pro is a complete waste of money and does not really change at all the only one calling my name is the psvr 2 that is gonna be a change>>><<<after being round the block selling my soul this remains my go to channel for vr news >>><<<ctrl c ctrl v>>><<<this headset is very cool however you can just tell that they took so much from the quest >>><<<does it support big screen i mean what about movie watching >>><<<not even considering any standalone headsets if they do not support alvr maybe they will port it over soon >>><<<i own an oculus rift while quest 2 seemed interesting trying the headset i found it to be way heavy and i am not sure i am all sold on it pico seems like a a good option mostly because i only play pc vr but i am unsure if i should invest in it is it worth upgrading from oculus rift to a pico also i wish more vr makers could make controllers like valve index >>><<<should you upgrade from quest 2 to pico 4 >>><<<so it does have capacitive sensors inside the controllers never seen that mentioned in other reviews >>><<<will it ever come to the states >>><<<i have a question will this vr headset be good for bone works or any games like that like example half life alex>>><<<it is october 22 and i am pretty sure like it is already sold out>>><<<shame they gave up on the displayport that wouldve really set it apart from the quest 2 but i guess the extra production cost versus the amount of people you have access to a powerful enough pc was just not worth it in their eyes i guess current gpus are now powerful enough where the compression isnt that noticeable unlike back in 2016 when it was necessary considering the 1060 being what was available at the time>>><<<i feel like i wasted my money on the oculus quest 2 >>><<<i wan t to get a vr headset should i get a quest 2 or the pico 4 >>><<<if you could please not jam the headphone plug into that usb port that would be wonderful thanks >>><<<am buying both for the hell of it>>><<<owned by tiktok i am immediately out facebook is trash tiktok is an actual dumpster fire >>><<<best saber suck>>><<<i got really excited thinking the controllers had finger tracking like the index sadge >>><<<pico 4 for pcvr quest 2 for standalone amp pcvr as someone with neither i do not know how important standalone will be to me so it is really not clear what i should get lol plus i miss out on being able to play re4vr and other quest exclusives >>><<<good deal if you want china harvesting all ur data>>><<<fuck the ccp and anything that they use to steal our data >>><<<just received my pico 4 and it is night and day difference for me from quest 2 however i can totally understand why some people may not feel as big a difference for me the sweet spot area in quest 2 is lenses is so small that it is almost unusable i actually ended up digging out my rift s again pico 4 is sweet spot is vastly bigger it is still not the entire field of view but not nearly as disruptive as in quest 2 therefore if you have also suffered from the tiny center clear area of quest 2 you will find pico 4 being miles better but if you have not had any problem with quest 2 in the first place you might not be as blown away >>><<<i still do not understand why they thought it was a good idea to region lock them like at least give the option to unlock it when buying one from china>>><<<giving my info to ccp vs lizardman i would choose ccp >>><<<i do not want to own either headset from facebook or china both are just spyware peices of junk of course saying all that people will just consider a conspiracy theorists or something >>><<<i need your opion on this i currently have a quest 1 for pcvr and i am going to get a new headset should i just stick with a quest 2 because i already have some standalone games on it or should i look at getting a pico 4 i need to know by the end of the month so anyone give me some advice please >>><<<i really like the look of the pico 4 but i just do not want to buy all of my games software again if only there was some kind of cross platform option >>><<<awesome detailed review as always i was waiting to see details of the pico 4 pro trying to decide if and when to upgrade from quest 2 with it only for enterprise outside china the pico 4 is an appealing option may wait and see what happens with the software updates and pico store great to see more options coming including psvr2 competition is great but it does make it hard to know where to spend my dollardollar also caution with committing too much to one platform excited to see what comes from sidequests backing from google this has the potential to make switching platforms easier and not losing your library could google play become the vr game store of choice >>><<<im actually thinking of switching my quest 2 for my pcvr use>>><<<quest 2 forever boiz >>><<<nice review i ordered my pico 4 set today and it is expected delivered on wednesday i live in norway and seems no delivery problems here at least not what i heard >>><<<this headset is literal garbage right now though because of its game library there is literally no reason to buy something that doesnt have any good games to play>>><<<would never support tik tok binance they are part of this county going to shambles so therefore i would rather have the quest 2>>><<<when i save up i am buying to upgrade from my quest 1>>><<<i just want that shiny box it comes in >>><<<if these come to the us i would consider one to replace my rift s >>><<<thank you>>><<<tea tea coffee 4 life >>><<<kind of crazy how similar it is to the quest 2 even the system menus looks like the quest i guess that is a good thing though if you are the kind of person that wants a quest 2 just without the facebook nonsense >>><<<pico 4 pinnochio 4 >>><<<pico obviously copied the quest 2 they re stooopid to have brought it out it s non innovative i ll only upgrade my quest2 in 2 years from now or if apple comes out with their version of vr  ar why would anyone in their right minds upgrade to a pico 4 i meant pinnocchio 4>>><<<got my pico 4 yesterday and left eye have 1 dead pixel in center lol sometimes i see it rare but it is what it is >>><<<hi mike i am a new subscriber i know absolutely nothing about gaming i had no interest in gaming but after just turning 60 i have been discouraged by my physical health which has kept me from travel as i want too so i decided for now to travel in vr you are the 1st video i came upon in looking for a headset so the other day i went and bought a quest 2 and the head and face thingy is you use on yours i have also gotten very interested in games by watching your videos thank you for all the great information on all these amazing products this advanced card maker lol is moving into a new world and it is all your fault  your channel is amazing >>><<<wait wait the pico recording is native 16 9 with a decent fov >>><<<idk the pico 4 seems better than the quest 2 now but how is it gonna hold up when the quest 3 comes out>>><<<if this headset could connect with displayport i would have bought it but compressed makes it not worth switching out my reverb>>><<<so as a replacement for the rift s its good i am looking forward to cutting the wire with the bonus of getting to keep my oculus library via virtual desktop >>><<<yeet>>><<<yeet>>><<<ah yes chinese spyware >>><<<you lost me at owned by same company as tiktok so it is just a chinese version of the quest 2 got it >>><<<china>>><<<0 chance china is not weaponizing this as a spy tool zero >>><<<i m coming from quest 1 it will be a generational leap forward can t wait for it to arrive x >>><<<man i kinda wanna consider getting this over the quest 2 how much does it cost though >>><<<this guy reminds me of dantdm>>><<<i have a question can u play roblox on pick 4 >>><<< 1 56 my ocd kicks in i wanna remove that hair>>><<<i think i just wasted my money child as a young one by buying the quest 2 is this true>>><<<the really dropped the ball without dp on this one so sad>>><<<bytedance fuck that this is a ccp spy tool hard pass >>><<<see they released a headset but now you already bought a bunch of games on the quest 2 so youre not gonna switch anyway>>><<<look ik that people are saying pico is better but keep in mind quest 2 came out 3 years ago remember pico has flaws that quest does not>>><<<i thought this was bill burr>>><<<scalpers will destroy all consumer products for some products to be successful like game consoles and vr headsets you need as much of them possible in the hands of actual consumers example the new pico 4 vr headset to have developers create content for it it has to be in the hands of as many people as possible with every single one scalped the sh t out of there is not a single one on the market eventhough the original price of a 256 gig version is 500 bucks amazon is scalp devision sells them at 900 bucks and are already sold out permanently making the future of it as bleak as the ps5 in one generation of scalping game consoles are dead vr will go the same way in the end we will have nothing left we are witnessing the end of popular consumer products the only way to stop this is sell one per verified person at the normal retail price companies are to shortsighted to see how just selling everything to scalpers will kill their own products in the future it is sickening i really wanted to buy a ps5 but gave up on that years ago i am not paying a scalper anything i hope they get stuck with tons of unsold sh t and die in a fire nobody should pay these a  les a single penny i will probably never get my hands on a pico 4 vr either and have to exept my dated quest 2 will be the last standalone vr i will ever own and with no playerbase any software sales depended products are dead on arrival the solution is simple and starts at the companies that manufacture them stop selling in bulk to non consumers ffs >>><<<having aspherical lenses is a huge plus imo it should greatly improve the sweet spot in addition the fresnel type lenses always seem to give me a headache they cause tons of visible distortion i hope we see more headsets going to smooth glass lenses >>><<<i do not like because controller using aa battery i want rechargeable battery like the controller of sony and xbox>>><<<i am looking for a device which has a better resolution and fov than q2 to play dcs without breaking my bank account this may be the one >>><<< 1 16 lcd displays ist saying display twice >>><<<the only question i have is why on earth would you use a grenade to open a door and then waste another one on a single zombie are you made of grenades >>><<<that was a great thorough review mike thank you >>><<<same company as tiktok gross get this trash our of here from a trash company>>><<<beat saber isn t on it so hard pass>>><<< these chinese dudes are so op >>><<<i am going nowhere near this just for the fact that this company has already been caught access american user data i do not want to give the chinese government access to inside my house facebook is bad enough>>><<<it is bad the head strap is not removable and it is not a snug enough fit it is unusable laying down>>><<<it is actually not the display less bright it is the pancake lenses that make the image more dim>>><<<thanks very good review >>><<<i got my pico 4 about 48 hours ago and yesterday there were many more games than day before in the store so the content issue might be outdated soon and i love it very comfortable for my head and the pcvr streaming is awesome rtx 3080 with 1000 mbit router so much better than my f ing vive cosmos with a cable just not great for sim racing since those games in vr brings down every system without 4090 to it is knees already without streaming but it was playable and the input lag probably similar or even less than with v sync on a pancake but no problem with hl alyx and finally a great experience in this game >>><<<its nice to compare quest 2 release 13 10 2020 vs pico 4 release 15 10 2022 and say that its almost the same parameters xd>>><<<i have the pico myself and just wanted to say i think the tracking isnt great with movement i noticed when i opened the pico menu or library the screen is slightly moving and doesnt feel as stable as on the quest 2 lets hope it wil get fixed in some update but its really weird noone has noticed this >>><<<i believe that pico is on the right track just ironing out the bumps but with a little help from the community and devs i think that this will be a vr headset that will push the boundaries of vr call me dumb but i see a bright future for them well done to pico amp great video mate just sad that im broke i would loved to used this pico 4  >>><<<power adapter how mich w >>><<<freality not the same anymore hope you return in the near future>>><<<must be nice to be able to afford an oculus anyway love the content keep it up bro>>><<<i do not trust chinese companiese or companiese related to chinese fund so i will not buy this however competition is good thing for consumers whatsoever nice review as always >>><<<hey there i mainly would play steam vr games and only had a quest 2 for a month some time would you recommend the pico 4 for me or would you recommend me to wait for a 4 pro >>><<<if you were to use vr with link cable to pc so you can run wired steam games wou not the audio come out of your pc does this mean you can use wireless 2 4 headphones with dongle example steelseries 7 or higher to have much lower latency >>><<<basically a pancake quest in more ways than one flater overall headset and flat lenses>>><<<after all that shady stuff byte dance did also with the upcoming eye tracking do not believe i could trust this maker>>><<<i am confused the internet connection is that so you can play games directly from the pico 4 website without a pc or is that for down loading soft wear  >>><<<this is a great review for someone trying to decide between a pico 4 and quest 2 for their first vr headset virtual desktop makes the investment worth it as it gets around the lack of pico store apps by letting you use those from the quest store as for there being no audio jack i would recommend the ad adtrip usb c splitter it is slightly long but very affordable and better than the 2 port adapters available >>><<<the larger sweet spot fov and this resolution is really tempting over the q2 their next headset should be amazing they have earned their place >>><<<slippery and extremely undermining road for vr in general this approach that this us meta are using by banning the best standalone vr titles from other stand alone devices it will create tensions like we also see on xbox and playstation with certain people using an extremely black amp white perspective depending on which fraction your into bed with  why not let as many people as posiible be able to enjoy good content and do not have to purchase another expensive vr headset just to play certain titles that could easily be played on a product they alreayd have with the exact same soc and android based os not to mention the e waste but its us meta facebook common logic and simply having an eye on the biggger picture and the greater good for the masses useally do not take center there i do not have a vr headset but not a fan of that rancid meta approach >>><<<comfort and light leakage was my biggest issue with it too having a big nose i also found it dug into my nose too i would definitely consider buying again i returned it if there is a decent 3rd party facial interface but i suspect it could be quite a wait as most 3rd party companies are probably going to wait and see how it sells first >>><<<sounds a bit familiar>>><<<i see that little atf juggy in there wicked review >>><<<no 3 5 mm jack is instant nope>>><<<bought this absolutely awful lets light in from the sides so you can see the room in the lenses downloaded one game war planes which i played on the quest 2 writing was blurry controls way too sensitive tried to watch amazon prime movies just a blank screen with sound most disappointing was the environment very basic even typing on the virtual keyboard was awful if you wanted to use special characters like or dollar compared to the quest 2 it was night and day the quest 2 is like a smart phone the pico 4 is like a nokia 5190 for those of us who are old enough to remember them it was so dreadful i have sold it after a day >>><<<only problem for me is lack of gamez>>><<<great review i only heard about pico recently i have looked into index htc etc and have a quest2 but i needed to know something on this one covered all the bases love your work >>><<<is there a way to buy and play lone echo 2 on pico 4 >>><<<good review i will stick with the three quest 2 is we use in my house mine and my 2 daughters video definitely deserved a like >>><<<my pico 4 arrived today setting everything up reminded me of when i did the same routine with the quest 2 in 2020 only this time i was not struggling to find the sweet spot constantly adjusting the headset avoiding scratching the lenses with my glasses suffering the face plate pressed against my face determined to really enjoy this new vr experience i bought the q2 mainly to watch tv and films on a huge screen with total immersion i never got that faceplate after face plate strap after strap counter weight after counter weight little did i know that my stubbornness would last over 18 months until i gave up on it it will soon be on ebay and good riddance to it now having learned with the q2 i was wary of the p4 but right out of the box i felt that same childlike eagerness to use it as i felt with the quest but this time i was not disappointed it is so much better than the q2 so much lighter and the sweet spot is huge yes the faceplate is a little rough but it is not clamped to my face as the quest was and wearing glasses is easy peezy the longest i wore the q2 was 40 minutes and most of that time was spent adjusting the headset i lost track of time with the p4 tonight you know it is there but it is not dominating your time in vr i know i can never have those two years back but with this unit i will certainly try to make up for that lost time >>><<<my pico 4 arrived yesterday thankfully it took a while to get it comfy but then i did not suffer the same issues as mike i have had a 0g quest and usually rock a reverb g2 but wanted some cable free action not as visually impressive as the g2 but everything else ticks the right boxes and it is not meta woot right now virtual desktop is a must have though the pico option is not up to the task at time of writing >>><<<yes the is back>>><<<so in a few words not worth an upgrade>>><<<argh no audio jack everyone keeps making the same booby  but most will use the built in speakers i guess i can not remember the amount of times i regret buying a phone with no headphone jack after losing all those usb c to 3 5 adaptors it does look really good though me wants >>><<<an actual balanced review of the pico 4 i have seen some other channels discuss it and suggest should i upgrade to the pico 4 from the quest 2 with the implication that its clearly better all around my initial thoughts were it doesnt make sense for me to switch horses for such a modest gain especially with the cost ive sunk into stand alone games and it seems to kind of bare out as true i guess it is nice to have another device out there though even if it isnt the right choice for me currently thanks for the review >>><<<software looks just like quests>>><<<damn kind of wish i got a pico instead of the quest 2 my main gripe being the ipd i batter to get that sweet spot as its in between the 3 shitty click settings >>><<<i own a quest 1 and i was thinking about the quest pro however that was back when we still thought it would be around 800 usd i might pick up the pico 4 pro since it will have all the fancy stuff and the software will be more mature>>><<<how much is it in money no gbp>>><<<i would consider this a clear upgrade if the new quest pro controllers did not exist anything that uses led strips just seems primitive by comparison >>><<<nice honest review pico 4 is a fantastic standalone headset for me i am very much into pcvr and while this seems to give a good experience i already own a g2 and the through the lens footage on the internet is showing the g2 significan notly better if i were to buy a standalone headset i would probably get the quest pro over the pico 4 as the mixed reality experience really fascinates me i am not sure but why could not pico have provided 2 colour passthrough cameras for a 3d stereoscopic display >>><<<i have never had a vr headset but i can afford either a quest 2 or a poco 4 i want to primarily game so which one do you recommend >>><<<thanks for the honest review everyone else seems to be over hyping the image quality nice to hear that it is about on par with quest 2 i will stick to my aero >>><<<would it be a good idea to buy pico 4 when you already have a quest 2 >>><<<i do not want to support a bytedance ccp headset >>><<<did not know it was owned by the tik token company can we get an affordable vr that does not have people constantly gathering our info ffs lol is not tik tok in trouble for gathering face data and now they are getting this directly on your face >>><<<my ipd is not quite symmetrical i wonder how much of a difference it would make to be able to move each lens independently relative to the nose of my bridge >>><<<the only question i have is does it come black i am only half serious but i really do hate white hardware it gets dirty way too quick and i am not the kind of person that constantly wipes everything down every time i use it >>><<< 13 23 mrtv show some adapter 3 5mm and type c in one device so there are solution already >>><<<you take your tea the same as i do hey mike your videos are so nicely done hi to your puppy and family >>><<<in 10 years time we will realize we have been wearing vr contact lenses for the past 2000 years but we just forgot to take them off >>><<<super disappointed there is not a headphone jack that is the one thing i needed >>><<< 8 40 the same problem i had with pico neo 3 link i sold it already and ordered pico 4 but you are the 1st reviewer who said about this problem >>><<<well it is a quest killer for me as i will sell my quest 2 for only one reason the quest is very uncomfortable to wear so i rarely use it i even play much more with the old psvr 1 the pico is my new pcvr headset and the coming psvr 2 will be my main headset for gaming being comfortable for longer than just a few minutes is very important for me i have quite a huge head maybe the quest is more acceptable if you have a smaller head do not know >>><<<i just had to send back my quest 2 because the controller drifted and i am planning on buying these so how is the quality the dead pixel scares me and my glasses are big and had problems to use them in quest 2 space inside in pico is better >>><<<looking to finally get into vr so what is the current generation beyond those from last year i plan to buy late this year or 2023 so i am wondering if i should wait or who is the front runner or best bang for the buck in the us >>><<<i have just got a rift s still is this headset much of an improvement over that i do not really play games on these only would use for vr simulation and racing flying sims >>><<<love the competition i am hoping wifi 6e in newer headsets will improve wireless pcvr streaming lightweight wireless vr is the dream for quality>>><<< 2 37 the exact moment that my dreams of having a great vr headset without the downsides of the quest 2 were shattered>>><<<you can still order it for amazon here in the states it just will take longer to get here with that headset it seems like it has all the same problems that the quest to have when it first launched so once we start getting third party accessories i am sure it will make that headset much more comfortable>>><<<well there are some new headphones that you can use that were made for virtual reality and their bluetooth which i am sure you already know about>>><<<not a great alternative when it is own by yet another social media company >>><<<quote you do not need a tictoc account to use it yeah not yet that is exactly what oculus promised when they were bought out by facebook i have a reddit response from palmer lucky himself promising that >>><<<if they added a displyport this would have been the vr headset for literally everyone>>><<<bytedance privacy is my concern >>><<<i have bought one today its for xmas  >>><<<quest 2 loader is the killer >>><<<ty for the video if i have some games on the oculus do i need to buy them again for the pico >>><<<i would like to hear in the review about tests how much data does it transfer to china what data is stored on chinese servers >>><<<great product no library of top titles so interim pass for sure >>><<<typical strongly negatively biased review from a vr youtuber who is paid from meta simply ridiculous >>><<<so i have a q1 would you say that i should rather go for q2 or pico 4 100percent pc vr is going to be a factor for me>>><<<thank you for the detailed review >>><<<i think what is cool about the motorised ipd is that if different people use it they can just use their accounts>>><<<yeah i have a dead pixel on my quest 2 ugh>>><<<i am getting pico4 in 4 days i hope >>><<<nice review finally someone notices the similarity with the pico and ready player one lol my only concern is motion sickness as that is what is been putting me off buying any vr headset>>><<<dang the editing is  >>><<<a great review and as a long time follower and owner of psvr oculus rift oculus go oculus quest and quest 2 i have enjoyed keeping up with vr information i ordered my pico 4 and recieved it yesterday launch day and very impressed with the visuals i have slowly but surely moved to more games via the pc with steam and cross buy of the oculus meta games means many are now available to my pc only a few star wars games limited to quest 2 so i will be keeping this competition is a good thing to have so i really welcome this release also with the headphone adaptor you can find a longer version usb c to headphone with charging upto 60w on amazon if you want to add that option >>><<<please someone make a non stand alone headset again i do not want to pay for heavier headset with high tech chips i am never gonna use>>><<<it is made by bytedance why the f would i sell my soul the chinese spy party >>><<<it is gonna be so cool if sidequest could work on pico devices>>><<<cheers for not clickbaiting quest 2 killer  >>><<<looks like a great competitor i look forward to seeing what they do to it in the future that being said i will probably stick with my quest 2 as i already have a good library that i would rather not have to repurchase >>><<<do not forget the pico pro>>><<< 15 25 ahahahahahahahahah>>><<<fantastic review covered all the things i wanted to learn about the headset thanks>>><<<is this available in the us >>><<<i need to know i am getting a vr headset for standalone games not pcvr which headset should i get please help right now i am looking and pico 4 and meta quest 2 please let me know>>><<<beatsaber will not be coming any time soon lol >>><<<wait the wired image quality is worse than wireless what is the point of having the wired option then what is it for just for people who like falling over some wires >>><<<great video thanks because of this excellent review i am binning my quest 2 and getting a pico 4 >>><<<is it going to acquire titles like bonelab beatsaber stuff like that in the future >>><<<i still have the oculus rift cv1 and i am looking for an low price alternative to connect to my pc the rift2 is not anvailable in my country and i need alot of space for my glasses or special lenses for the vr system most intern visionadaptation is not enough for me to get a clear picture the large gabs on the side sounds nice for my big head maybe the pico 4 is the one i was looking for but are there anny protectors for the lenses anvailable as i said my glases are special and on oculus rift i tapt the lenses alot with may glasses until i got a pare of bonus lenses in my vision parameters i am scared of scratshing the lenses >>><<<they literally copied quest 2 is whole system ui it is from china we are not surprised>>><<<pico will not be getting advanced chip like meta in the future >>><<<i hate meta but i also hate bytedance gimme a headset that is not backed by a shadowy cabal plz>>><<<i get motion sick af it is my first vr headset and i am not convinced at all by vr after that first use yesterday the image is really bad blurry when you need to read text or stuff i tried every setting of the lenses it gets close but still shitty maybe my face is just weird will test with the spacer again later maybe that helps but as for now meh better wait 1 2 more yrs >>><<<quest 2 is way batter >>><<<how would it look choppy when the video is only at 30fps >>><<<i like mike but this is yet another mainstream review laden with caveats to appease meta the take home for me is this as a pcvr headset it is superior to the quest 2 it is cheaper it is more enjoyable watching media content on the pico 4 than it is in the quest 2 the controllers are superior in terms of tracking sure you could argue it is not a quest 2 killer but it is definitely not it is equal it is superior the only point i would concede is the software features need some work too many meta ambassadors on yt with one eye on zuck >>><<<dead pixel on arrival i hope i will be lucky with my unit i enjoyed dead pixels with my pimax and i do not want to experience it again great review >>><<<get pico 4 or wait for psvr2 sold my quest 2 and do not want to get another one at this point >>><<<hey vr oasis excellent review have you tried the usb type c 3 5mm adapters that allow pass through charging there are a quite a few adapters on amazon for example >>><<<is there a way to have your quest 2 library on your pico 4 >>><<<the original pico neo 3 non link supported the vr usb c port on the 2000 series nvidia cards    does this one support that feature >>><<<know htc vive are teasing a new headset if it is ther same as the pico 4 but with wigig 2 wifi that would make me happy as good pc wireless headset with low latency wigig2 wouldd be nice>>><<<just unboxed my pico 4 and my first impression was disappointed the face cushion is so stiff it pressed my face much more than the quest 2 i did not feel it light at all it also left ugly marks on my face just after a few minutes of play terrible  there was no tracking at all until i set the boundaries it made me feel dizzy the worst bug if i shake my head quickly the whole scene moves with my head like there was no tracking at all this does not happen with the quest 2 very annoying  the color pass through is also very bad objects that are 1 5m tall were displayed as flat on the floor the depth sensor is clearly missing without that it is a mess overall the pico 4 is a huge disappointment i think i will cry  and will sell it as soon as i can >>><<<i love watching movies in vr and for me this would be a compelling buy but  no headphone jack is a deal breaker i will pass sadly >>><<<this is the first time i heard someone mention the controllers having capacitive sensors which not having them was a major con for me at first so if this is true i have nothing to worry about in vrchat>>><<<i own a quest 2 and do not need this at the moment but even if i considered buying it i would not do it it because of the lack of headphone jack it is a big con for me >>><<<what i think about pico 4 is they must have a better option in anyway than quest 2 if not this headset will not have a competitive value and its not a quest killer but how to survived from quest 2 not killed after they launch and sell their headset thats what my opinion>>><<<tbh i would feel kinda scammed buying this >>><<<seems crazy you can not plug headphones in>>><<< loving your in depth review buddy been a fan for ages this cements you as an honest non biased reviewer respect lee marvin hitchman ladbible shaun attwood neil samworth is real porridge etc >>><<<how to connect pico 4 to tv >>><<<lol it reminds me of the vive focus 3>>><<<as you said you could not try the fitness app or parties pre release now it is released can you comment on these features did the pass through get any better moving from os 5 0 to 5 2 0 >>><<<thanks for the great review was really looking forward to seeing this i hope the headset does well and brings more people to vr definitely a competitor at a reasonable price >>><<<imagine in 12 months when quest 3 releases probably the pico 5 will too if the latter has eye tracking it might be a game changer at least for pc vr users >>><<<nice one mike>>><<<can not wait for your arpara review>>><<<the lack of an audio jack is a deal breaker for me>>><<<i can not help but think the reviewer was underwhelmed i have ordered one purely because the quest 2 has a single screen whereas the pico 4 has two dedicated screens which is perfect for those of us with a larger ipd this is a big deal but was glossed over here >>><<<thanks for the review mike and for covering the pcvr section in such detail cheers >>><<<it may not have beat saber but it does have smash drums with 3 extra songs >>><<<there is an issue with the lenses surprised you did not mention it more it is fine when gaming but really noticable in the home environments and when the keyboard and menu systems>>><<<why does the interface look like the quests lol>>><<<bought my new quest 2 at 349euros sold it last week at 349euros when i saw the pico 4 but i am not buying it now i will wait sometimes to see the evolution but if i needed a vr headset now i would definitely choose the pico 4 for the people who say the quest is better fuck pico you are just mad you bought a quest for the same price or higher these are both good headset but the pancake lenses and the weight distribution would be enough for me to go for the pico the quest 2 is not enjoyable with the original strap and all that weight on the nose althought i do not have a giant nose without the glass spacer i could not use the quest 2 cause of the pain alleluja >>><<<looks like someone got our back for when meta will inevitably go bankrupt due to all the stupid s they are doing right now d thanks for the in depth and complete review do not apologise for the long video >>><<< owned by bytedance that is where i turned off the video >>><<<hi does it work with quest 2 is pirated apps games >>><<<comfort is a biggie for me cf q2>>><<<thank you for honest review the front foam feels very comfortable to me maybe we have differently shaped heads but there is a bit of light leakage on the sides also you can use both link cable and audio jack using hub >>><<<damn i bought quest 2 a week ago should i sell it or keep it >>><<<isnt it horrible youd need to repurchase your entire games library absolute deal breaker>>><<<128 or 256 >>><<<something i am struggling with when it comes to vr like quest or peco these companies are not the most trustworthy having data and privacy issues but make such appealing vr products >>><<<how can pico shamelessly copy entire quest ui to their headset as if that is a ok thing>>><<<looks like you beat thrill to it damn>>><<<nice review and thorough review i got myself the pico 4 after testing it at a roadshow its quite abit cheaper in my region compared to the quest 2 and way more comfortable i do have to say in regards to your point about fit vr is a very personal thing and fits different people differently i have a rounder and bigger head so the pico 4 fits me perfectly with zero light leaks whereas the quest 2 was way too snug and pinching the area around my eyes so my advice is always try to find a test unit first to try out the fit before buying>>><<<can i play gorilla tag on it >>><<<thanks for honest review mate for sure vrcover and bobovr had cook something of their sleeve for this bad boy >>><<<my god the shiny black front was sucking the fingerprints right off me just watching the video my vr upgrade had been long overdue and i have been watching the pico with great interest but i think i will be looking around for a decent second hand quest 2 and wait for the psvr 2 for the main course awesome video as always >>><<<great for some amogus vr>>><<<it is not an alternative but a better option >>><<<quest 2 better than pico 4 it is true>>><<<the meta exclusive games are not the horizon zero dawn type of games so i will not miss one of them i think in the long run the pico store will be superior if the devs can sell in china too i will get the pico 4 today bye bye dusty quest2 >>><<<hey mike is there a new podcast for you that i can catch you on >>><<<cool i will wait for the quest 3 thank you >>><<<oh boy i have been waiting for this video let me just drop the kid off to school and get comfortable >>><<<samsung where are you >>><<<looks like a true bootleg>>><<<finally a real assessment is it worth reselling your quest 2 to pico 4 not sure you know i bought a belt for the waist 3 months ago made in china it only lasted 2 months to break i have never bought something that comes from china and is of good quality we see it here with the deadpixel cheap products cheap parts pay you for what you have for those who ordered a pico 4 from america good luck with warranty and returns >>><<<still waiting for the pimax crystal>>><<<owned by tiktok that is enough information a communist company that collects data on users >>><<<sail is coming soon to pico vr >>><<<you know i really think this headset seems good but there is one thing the fact that the quest 2 has a replaceable headstrap is so good because mine is battery is pooped and only lasts an hour but now i have a confortable headstrap with hot swappable battery backs and i havent had to worry about charge since i am sure solutions like that will come to the pico 4 but ima keep my quest 2 with infinite battery edit i finished the video and i see that bobovr has already done it but no interchangeable headstrap >>><<<i live in china so not needing to use a vpn to use this instead of the quest is tempting >>><<<solid review but i am still considering replacing my quest2 with the pico4 simply because the visual sweetspot is too small on the quest2 and it is too front heavy >>><<<if i was not so deep into the quest 2 with the shear amount of games i have purchased i would totally have bought this it seems better in terms of hardware in almost every way compared to the quest 2 >>><<<good evening mike great review video on the pico 4 i deftly looking into getting a headset that can do both pc vr and standalone vr have a good evening mike >>><<<how is the comfort in quest 2 out of the box its more expensive headset and i hear you have to buy elite strap because its so uncomfortable >>><<<i hope they release a narcissistic app that lets me dance like an idiot in my living room>>><<<definitely more competition is welcome although i am a little concerned about how byte dance owns pico i hope privacy is some what at a respectable level and not turn into tiktok and collect and sell user data and provide it to the chinese government  sure meta is just as bad but i trust meta with my data more then a chinese company who collects more data from tiktok then every other social media around >>><<<one of the biggest arguments for the pico is for me the huge sweet spot this should really improve the experience>>><<<surprised you you did not say anything about not being able to switch head straps since you have a love affair with your bobo strap >>><<<that is a nice looking headset i still have the first oculus quest but not sure whether to wait>>><<<chinese communist party vr headset no thanks>>><<<not a quest 2 killer easy the games ok did not have to watch the whole video bye  oh also probably the software but we all forget quest 2 took 2 years  to get where it is now>>><<<i received mine last week and im loving it for once i can buy games in my currency it was way more comfortable than the meta ones and the face cushion wasnt as bad for me and the weight my god so light my only gripe is the controller buttons do not feel as premium as quest but thats a minor feeling i do also wish it had more productivity and leisure apps on their store>>><<<why in the world would they not include the headphone jack that is kind of dumb in my opinion >>><<<hey mike is the ability to just load up apk files and install them on the headset easily still in this one cheers >>><<<sucks if you have a quest and want this you will have to buy all the games again>>><<<i currently have a quest 1 99percent of the time i am playing pc vr content wirelessly would you recommend the pico 4 or quest 2 as an upgrade >>><<<great video loved hearing your insight on this product curious if they will ever come to the states>>><<<does this run android like the quest 2 >>><<<if all these devices are going to have their own exclusive game stores then i am not buying any of them pcvr for life >>><<< 13 24 usb c audio amp charge adapter product id cdp2capdm>>><<<there in adapter from ugreen 3 5mm and usb c both i have it it works great for about 16 dollars>>><<<holy i did not realized it looked like the one from ready player one>>><<< 4 33 72hz is smooth >>><<<i ordered my pico 4 a week ago on aliexpress from china still havnt got it as it only shipped yesterday but hey i still get it early compared to the october 18th release being in usa im hella stoked for it most exited for the comfort and combination of the best 2 headsets the quest 2 tracking and hp reverb resolution >>><<<quest 2 better>>><<<thank you for not making clickbaity junk and just doing a straight to the point review >>><<<nothing with tiktok associations nope>>><<<who here is buying the quest pro>>><<<wait is bill burr doing product reviews >>><<< 4 37 well pancake lenses make it darker and less vibrant 11 27 not gonna lie i have seen a million reviews for that thing already and you have been the only one to mention that so far 11 31 i like that idea taking screenshots in the quest is a pain in the plot i guess those controllers do not have capacitive sensors though 12 05 seems to be a legit design but then the touch pros do not have tracking rings at all and those are compatible with the q2 12 11 bonelabs street puncher mike imma gonna punch them with lead to the head 12 24 honestly i did not expect that because of the cheapo look and i somehow thought those would have to be transparent for that for some reason probably all the controllers with that feature so far having transparent buttons  13 17 afaik there are adapters that have a passthrough usb c port that can not pass through data though so at least it is possible to have an additional battery pack but not corded link 15 43 cries in germany d had to get it from france having a tokyo drift controller and no support probably just trying to get the pro controllers right away instead of bothering getting that one replaced somehow  16 10 yeah bytedance fricken xicoms for anyone jumping on the train now after not getting a quest 2 because of teh zucc being a lizard selling your precious data this is not an alternative btw >>><<<just do not expect a wired pcvr option that is all i use my quest 2 for >>><<<if we where scared about our privacy with facebook buying oculus imagine buying a headset made by fckin tiktok>>><<<if you were seeing the dead pixel in the recording does not that mean it is a software thing not an issue with the screen >>><<<i had a quest 2 from launch and recently moved abroad but did not bring the headset with me i fancied another and had to choose between buying another quest and keeping my old game library or trying out the new pico glad i went for the pico where i live it is about gbp70 cheaper than the quest but with the lenses screens and other more modern hardware i had to give it a try it really is a nice upgrade over the quest 2 especially in the comfort and weight but you are definitely right about software hopefully the updates keep coming out i am just happy there is competition now it will push everyone forward >>><<<thanks >>><<<let is call it the meta killer instead>>><<<q2 has noticeable sde with movies >>><<<i wish we can get the pico in the us >>><<<if not in the oculus ecosystem it is media looks better movies and pc gaming seems better >>><<<will bonelab be coming to the pico 4 >>><<<this definitely has my interest when it comes to the us i like my quest 2 but the addition of competitors finally is awesome and i am considering getting one once more games come to it i have a lot of quest games for that headset only not on pc that i would lose though sadly that is a shame great video mike >>><<<you can get an adapter that has both usb c charging and audio jack those have been around since apple started the remove the headphone jack trend years ago did you have a beta build of the os5 which was released on the 18th or did you only get to use the os4 that it ships with >>><<<can you play crescendo on rec room with pico 4>>><<<great honest review the best yet i must say the pico 4 is the most best looking vr headset so far it has so much style >>><<<this is a superior product not just an alternative >>><<<is it worth buying >>><<<i have a quest 2 and the battery is almost shot is it possible to change the internal battery >>><<<i can see that the chinese state government has comprised you unsubcribing >>><<<soundcore vr p10 wireless gaming earbuds you should check these out for headphones>>><<<i would ask if you have any estimate for the release of the pico 4 pro maybe>>><<<i live in south africa and have been stuck with a second hand semi broken rift cv1 i decided to bite the bullet and order one from amazon with import costs i am very excited to basically double my resolution and maybe even go wireless >>><<<always leave a cheeky little like >>><<<i am most interested with the performance it is trying to push more pixels does the performance suffer games like b amp s n are taxing for the quest2 but what about for this >>><<<i cannot believe there is no headphone jack >>><<<wish it released in the us >>><<<i see the graphical upgrade in blade and sorcery graphics>>><<<got my one playing in morning >>><<<great vid bro doing the rounds currently>>><<<mike can you play android games and programs on the pico aka plex youtube third party 3d flat screen apps amp is there any chance of reverse wireless display for example taking a samsung or huawei and having their desktop mode beamed into pico or a desktop mode >>><<<heavens never apologise for a review being longer than usual provided it is timestamped there is no such thing as too long or detailed for a review >>><<<i may upgrade to this from my rift s when vr lens are available for it>>><<< 14 25 >>><<<the software looks like a blatant knockoff of the oculus quest ui>>><<<can you even trust a company that made tiktok all these oj simpson companies rubbing shekels on your data >>><<<is there any software or something to test if our internet is good enough for virtual desktop >>><<<what i see as missteps for pico no headphone jack no link version headset having the same name as the company edit it is the pico pico 4 >>><<<the pancake lenses are the reason it is less bright that will be something that all pancake style headsets suffer from either less bright or larger battery required >>><<<i am a simple guy i see no bin in thumbnail i click i like positive video >>><<<i am very sensitive to latency over wi fi what was the lowest possible latency you could achieve using virtual desktop >>><<<so much smaller then the quest 2  why do you compare them without the light shield it is not like they can be used without what kind of bias review is this >>><<<what about watching movies is it better than quest 2 i enjoy using big screen and other videos apps on quest no one has said anything about movie quality so just curious thanks>>><<<do you need a pc for it and do you need one for the cambria bc i will purchase that when it gets out>>><<<i wonder how it works on linux and if not now ift it will later>>><<<i am still rocking a rift s and i have not been very happy with it but i also do not wanna buy a quest 2 this might be my new headset it seems pretty darn good >>><<<is the pico better than the quest 2 >>><<<i am considering it but i am poor lol >>><<<if they fix that link quality and somebody makes a 3rd party face cover then it seems perfect>>><<< 10 15 why would a dead pixel show up on the recording sounds more like a software issue >>><<<great review look forward to the pro version>>><<<not worth it quest 2 still superior >>><<<the pico would be my very first vr headset sooo did i get it right that i can play beat saber and other games via steam >>><<<thanks for the review mike can you in your view can you tell us how this unit compares to the psvr2 thank you in advance >>><<<nobody mentions if you login to social apps do you find friends from oculus there does it login to the same social media servers as oculus >>><<<hey guys i am just thinking about buying my first vr headset i am thinking about pico 4 more sice i will play pc vr mostly but since i never had any vr headset i do not know how all this sw works i understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms but let is say i want to play beat saber i can play it via pcvr but what about lone echo somewhere i came across information that quest games can be run normally on pc via their app and then streamed to the headset via vr desktop so is it possible to play quest 2 exclusive games this way on pico 4 or do i have to resign myself to losing these games >>><<<swag man>>><<<if pico and pico pro manage to supply the world demand it will crush the quest pro>>><<<is there any news on this headset releasing to north america >>><<<got my pico 4 today it is a definite hardware upgrade over the quest 2 biggest things i like are the lens and comfort the face gasket has slight light bleed which is annoying but overall if you do not have any vr headset pico 4 is the way to go now for the foreseeable future >>><<<i bet the guys at pico were very happy when meta announced the msrp of the quest 2 was raised from euros349 to euros449 >>><<<i have a rift s i am looking for an upgrade but maybe i will wait for quest 3 or something the resolution and fov on the rift s are pretty bad nowadays >>><<<i would buy it if it got 120 hz >>><<<for the pico 4 i found for my head that if i raise the headstrap a little bit higher than what feels intuitive i get a much more even pressure distribution on the facial interface i also had the exact same experience with wired wireless pcvr streaming it seems to be locked to 40mbps streaming and the detail is noticably poor until i keep still for about a second or two virtual desktop is significan notly better to the point where i can play even while using a less than ideal router the battery life should definitely be more like 8000mah out of the box but besides that i am loving it >>><<<on vrchat ppl keep saying its the best yet it just came out and 99 99percent of them never try it>>><<<alos mike any news on pico 4 pro >>><<<this or psvr2 >>><<<are there free games on the pico store >>><<<is it normal that i lost 20percent of battery only in 20min with pico 4 >>><<< a cheeky little like on the video >>><<<how come your content is so similar to other youtube channels like cas and chary vr it seems like you both put out almost exactly the same videos is there some youtube oculus or company sponsorship going on >>><<<perhaps you should buy one for a fan of the channel when you get sent these early so you actually have some skin in the game i feel like your review would be more believable and also more true to form on what it will be like for retail people to actually buy it could improve the whole experience not saying you are lying but i feel like reviewers really do not seem to realize that there is an extreme risk for you to have an unconscious bias when this is the set up for review you seem like a really nice guy just some food for thought perhaps p s i am not trying to get your free stuff give it to one of these kids or someone with less money who can not afford one if anything i am flawed too not saying i am not >>><<<do you recommend any specific site to buy it im located in mexico im going to buy a headset and i was on the fence between quest 2 or pico 4 will be mainly using it for pcvr>>><<<mike what is the ps5 vr like compared topico4 hp reverb g2 plz no one else has mentioned them  keep up the good work m8>>><<<me wow mike is such a wholesome youtuber mike motions middle finger up and down me wtf >>><<<preordered one coming from the original quest wanted something for pc vr as well as getting out of the meta ecosystem before getting sucked in completely let is see how it goes looks promising at least>>><<<were not there just yet but 2025 will be insane>>><<<thanks mike great video as ever completion in the vr space can only be a good thing i have a quest 2 and am hoping that the quest 3 can learn from the quest pro i know the quest 3 is not a pro upgrade i mean tech wise for gaming and pico 4 to be a real step up hopefully next year >>><<<i was about to buy the neo 4 until i saw that vrchat was not on pico store i love my quest but i need the pico for the ipd and i also wanna try the new controllers so sad about not being able to play vrchat on the pico >>><<<wow pico straight up cloned the quest 2 software >>><<<100percent we will see vr goggles the size of sunglasses within 5 years >>><<<was really hoping that the pico would be comfortable so that i can forget that im wearing it during a movie >>><<<would virtual desktop work with the link cable or with the dongle adapter pico is going to release >>><<<stop recommending these products to people it is literally owned by the ccp it is not care about permissions it steals everything it can and very very soon as soon as conflict breaks out they have no obligation to continue supporting it software wise these are the same people that blatantly steal copyrighted materials left and right on a daily basis look at the headset itself for fuck sakes it is a quest to with a black strip in the bottom that was developed without having to innovate anything simply using hardware that is 3 years more advantageous because of when it came out and then comparing them like they are apples and oranges any money you send to them leaves the country and never comes back and fuels the war machine you have an ethical obligation to not push this crap>>><<<i was very pumped to see a non quest headset until i saw it was made by tiktok pass >>><<<upgrading from a rift s i feel like i am gonna need some extra stuff like vr desktop and maybe even the bobovr batteries to not have it be a downgrade from direct pcvr yet for wireless tech aswell as how fed up i am with my worsening set i would buy it one way or another shame a 20dollar software is the only good method for pc streaming tho real surprised pico is own app is not as good >>><<<mike great review as always i primarily use quest 2 for pcvr and you mentioned it is not a generational leap forward however given the better lenses and better resolution will i notice a significan not clarity difference and is beat saber properly playable at something like expert where very fast movement is necessary i keep hearing the video compression is really bad and virtual desktop is the way forward is it good enough for beat saber and similar games in your opinion >>><<<great review mike love how everyone flips the bird when showing hand tracking lol >>><<<my wifi is 530mbps download and 30 40mbps upload is that good enough for virtual desktop >>><<<great vid can not wait for mine to arrive d>>><<<what personal data do you need to give for a pico account>>><<<facebook  tik tok  >>><<<wow no headphone jack what a trash design sure it is a simple thing that some may not use but being able to charge and hear properly simultaneously keeps the quest 2 ahead in my book >>><<<i wonder if something like resident evil could just be sideloaded>>><<<whats the diffrence in a pico neo and just pico >>><<<being a lighter headset it will be a great addition to my quest2 i am retired so i can use the quest2 in the morning for my holofit and fitrx and in the evening take out the pico and play some bonelab half life alyx mods or minigolf and at the moment half life 2 vr during those games is when i feel the weight of the quest most  looking forwards to get the pico4 >>><<<hi mike do you notice the warp scaling error of the pico 4 which causes your view to slightly warp if you turn your head this has already been an issue on the pico 3 reported serveral times to the developers but has not been resolved yet even with the lastest firmware on the pico 4 the wrong scaling is present on both native and pcvr and should never have been approved by quality control in my opinion some people may not notice this but if you have had other headsets like the rift or quest 2 you immediately should see that there is something off here in some games it is not that apparent but others are just unplayable and feel jittery as hell >>><<<i like brightness and game access quest 2 it is thanks mike>>><<<hi vro i was wondering if you would suggest buying a pico 4 if you are going from a quest 1 with link >>><<<waiting for pico 4 pro a great quest pro alternative>>><<<the audio bluetooth latency will be an issue i had thought that they would remove the compression needed for pcvr by now was not there supposed to be a optional dedicated dongle to connect directly to the pc would not that help in removing the compression requirement otherwise this is a great product i hope they make those improvements in the next iteration if they can use oled display with higher refresh rate then that would be amazing >>><<<was that a g shoch watch >>><<<oh man what a review really well done i still got the oculus rift s i love this device absolutely do but it is getting old now the fov of that thing is just ruining a lot of immersion i might now order the pico 4 soon thanks to this review but i might still wait for the lenovo vr700 not sure yet >>><<<i really do not like this move for headsets using magnetic padding it probably is fine at this level of strength of magnets but it is a fact that we know that magnets can affect the brain in various ways the most dramatic of which is if you put a strong enough one over a specific area it will affect the fusiform face gyrus which will result in you not being able to see faces while its in place again there is probably nothing to worry about in this vr headset use case but i would just prefer other methods of attachment for such things myself>>><<<a ccp tech device is never a great alternative>>><<<if this and the quest 2 are neck and neck not needing a facebook account to use the pico 4 easily gives it the w for me >>><<<woah i am skipping out on this device tiktok is even worse than facebook i will just stick with windows mixed reality it might not be 4k but you are headset is not owned by these people i have nothing nice to say about tiktok it really is a surveillence system do not buy the pico headset get a samsung hmd odyssey windows mixed reality headset it is good enough >>><<<more resolution but worse display less weight but less comfortable mmmmh>>><<<i would defenitily buy a pico but they are not sold in country yet>>><<<it looks like a very good alternative although it seems to be the same experience you would have with a quest 2 even the interface arrangement layout widget and window colors all look the same as the quest 2 i wonder if pico found that meta s software experience is already great and just trying to copied the same in order catch some of that audience anyway great video mike >>><<<you are my favorite vr youtuber it is always very exciting to see you upload new videos and thrilling to see them >>><<<i have received my pico 4 around 2 weeks ago and i have enjoyed it alot i generally play pcvr games and i did not know about virtual desktop thanks for the information >>><<< virtual reality oasis could you provide an update to let us know if prescription lens inserts are available for new devices like this one because i got snap in lenses for quest 2 and i can never go back to wearing glasses under a vr headset>>><<<you can use usb c adaptor that has both 3 5mm jack and usb c passthrough>>><<<pico market is kind of new just compared with the quest store 2 years ago its a much bigger gamestore that quest had and yes everything is better at this headset hardware wise as the quest for me its still a questkiller >>><<<how perfectly you drew your boundary was eerily satisfying >>><<<i guess if you have the original quest this would be a great upgrade >>><<<lol how did you record the dead pixel >>><<<great review thankyou >>><<<are you sure it is a dead pixel you would not be able to record it without capturing through the lense footage imo>>><<<the lack of an audio jack is stupid >>><<<love watching your videos >>><<<the most honest review i have seen yet it is not a quest killer>>><<<great review mike i am glad it ran a little long as it allowed you to give us a thorough sense of what all the aspects of the pico 4 are all about honestly i am looking at the pico neo 3 since i only need a pcvr headset and want something that is a little more robust visually speaking than my rift s so far as i can tell the price is about the same and the g2 may be a bit too much for my pc is specs since i am only running a 3060ti should i make that leap or hold on until the quest 3 finally comes out or should i wait until black friday and go ahead and get the g2 anyway >>><<<is there any screen door effect >>><<<was that half life 7 30 >>><<<meta still has the best software the ui looks more polished and modern >>><<<good review i will wait for the quest 3 and bought a second hand quest 2 for euros260 as new i would rather invest in a ecosystems which is partly developped by and under supervision of goat john garmack than a company which is steered by the chinese government ccp has a huge stake in bytedance which ownes pico >>><<<it is a proper rip off>>><<<if ur thinking of buying a quest 2 for the 1st time buy this as it soo uch better and there is very few negatives where as quest 2 is near the end of its life>>><<<it looks like they copied so much from oculus>>><<<i see it as a hardware vs software issue the pico looks like a generally better headset but meta still has a huge leg up due to its exclusives like beat saber etc if someone found a way to port these exclusives to pico i would buy it in a heartbeat it really just depends on what you value more >>><<<quest 3 in 2023 >>><<<thanks mike i have one coming from amazon tomorrow for my pcvr library which i built up when i owned an index valves lack of wireless support which they promised years ago made me sell my index and i refused to buy into metas ecosystem so this seems perfect for wireless pcvr which i have waited years for thanks>>><<<i wish it was in the us >>><<<pico feels more like copi>>><<<for pc vr players in germany this is a dream there is till this point still no quest 2 available at official resellers when you are mostly playing pc vr and will change a better feeling face padding anyway this is in every single way a better choice not saying it is better than quest 2 overall but definitely a headset more suited for my need >>><<<i have no money for this so i will keep using quest 2 for as long as possible>>><<<hopefully someone can answer this for me if i have virtual desktop on steam will i still need to buy it on the pico store to use with pico 4 >>><<<i feel like in many ways it is two steps forward one step back good design in the strap with properly balanced weight but you can not replace it decent ish audio but no 3 5mm headphone jack pancake lenses and high res display but sluggish os skin comfortable and decently tracked controllers but bulky and heavy and also hard to make grips for due to their strange shape color passthrough but monoscopic and headache inducing i hope software support will improve the headset wherever possible and i hope first party hardware support with accesories will fix some of the issues because right now it is looking good but not as good as i hoped>>><<<can u fix a dead pixel>>><<<hmmm i will have to look into this might be a competitor for the quest>>><<<great coverage it is a quest 2 competitor and that is what we really need right now to make the market both more accessible and interesting >>><<<does this include a modded beat saber after side quest come outs>>><<<getting away from a facebook required account is worth it to me i think it is sad that no one commented on facebook lying about removing the requirement last year at this years facebook connect event >>><<<so a quest 2 minus the meta facebook part that is a win win in my book >>><<< 3 23 clean your lens please>>><<<wow they just ripped the ui right from oculus it looks good we just need some killer games >>><<<what would be your recommendations for someone who has no vr headset at all and is wondering which one to get between the pico 4 and the quest 2 let is say someone who would use both stand alone and pcvr >>><<<play some half life alyx workshop maps they are unlimited and as good as the game it is all i play in vr >>><<<why they do not add a dam micro sd slot is behond me >>><<<the quest has a blurry look to it when i play it just dosent look super clear and sharp when i watch a video feed of someone playing it live is the pico have this same issue >>><<<how much light in the room do you need to use this headset can i play in the dark >>><<<i am not buying this since i ai not trying to support tiktok>>><<< 1 19 can we just appreciate this editing>>><<<nice>>><<<great review thanks>>><<<does it still look like you looking into a binocular in the pico 4 headset cus thats what annoy me the most with quest 2 is that the black stuff around your vision>>><<<was not expecting that full rick sanchez while testing the hand tracking but there you were lol >>><<<a sleek sexy balanced light comfortable beautiful usable design this is the first case where i see a need for an american company to copy from a chinese company >>><<<haha i was literally binging reviews from channels i was not sure about but then this comes out just in time thanks a bunch >>><<<the reason i will never buy a quest product is their data harvesting and abhorrent privacy policy how does this compare >>><<<definitely upgrading from my rift s can not wait to see what wireless pcvr has to offer>>><<<this seems like a genuinely good option >>><<<i will give u leopard for it lol>>><<<pre ordered for more power and better lenses also much better controllers than quest 2 >>><<<shame its not a halo type headset not sure i trust the company either >>><<<mike you deserved a like from me for not calling it a quest killer  i would love to swap this with my quest 2 for virtual desktop with my vrchat full body setup but i am in the us >>><<<i am hoping for the vrcover too i agree that is what it really needs >>><<<where the 4k >>><<<is it a good standalone vr headset as i do not have a gaming pc was waiting for the psvr2 but not sure i want wired vr>>><<<its from china and the personal data given is extreme no its not a great alternative its actually only slightly worst unless of course you do not care about the ethical and moral dilemma of not owning your own digital shadow then yeah go for it sell a little bit more of yourself to them >>><<<thank you for

better than the quest 2 because of the weight balance not being more on your forehead and the way the strap and lenses fit on my face and head feels much better than the quest 2>>><<<good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life >>><<<is among us already available to the pico 4 if so how much it cost >>><<<if it was not for the only fact that pico 4 library is way more limited i would surely chose it now i am always in a stalemate between quest 2 quest 3 and pico 4 suggestions >>><<<any suggestions on how to get a new or like new one since i heard they are not available in the us thanks>>><<<i am new to exploring vr gaming so pardon my ignorant questions if it is connected to a pc for pcvr gaming can i still use my pc speakers for the sound output instead of the speakers on the headset or will i be hearing audio output from both the headset and my speakers and also i have heard about having to sign up for an account or something when using those meta vr headsets does this require an account if it does is an account absolutely necessary for pcvr gaming especially for flight and racing sims >>><<<love the pico 4 >>><<<can you use hotspot on iphone 13 to connect too pico 4 looking at getting one but no wifi>>><<<show do not tell will ya >>><<<quest 3 was able to connect to my pc through wifi 6 and it had no lag can this headset do that too >>><<<any devices with removable batteries is a big plus for me i use rechargeable aa and aaa batteries i have a bunch of them fully charged whenever needed you do a quick swap instead of waiting for them to charge and there are no worries of an internal battery that is difficult to replace when it breaks down >>><<<does it have any apps to watch cinema with your own 3d movie files >>><<<i just want a vr headset capable of watching vr movies while not having a fucking facebook account is is good for that >>><<<can i use virtual desktop to play wireless with my pc >>><<<am i missing something or did you not really mention the visuals or compare to anything for reference >>><<<rewatch your video and start counting how many times you touch your glasses and do not include the times you touch them when you actually are mentioning your glasses i will bet you did not realize you are doing it that much in the span of 16 minutes  just watched a video with norm from tested and he has the same tic >>><<<i love my pico 4 i have had it since launch sitting on about 70 games >>><<<would also mention you are still able to connect your bluetooth headphones >>><<<unfortunately the pico 4 is not available in the us still >>><<<will the fiber optic link cable keep this charged while playing >>><<<how do movies and youtube look compared to the q2 >>><<<so i got a totally noob question that i can not seem to find the answer to anywhere online i recently bought a pico 4 and im trying to figure out how to change the profile pic from the default yellow dog to one of my avatars that i created if anyone can answer that for me id greatly appreciate it tia >>><<<can you use a headset plugged into your pc if you plug the pico into the pc to use for vr audio>>><<<waiting for the quest 3 let me see which is better>>><<<it is just my first week into pico 4 i am a quest user but the pico system has so much freedom i can finally use discord without headashes the extra ram makes a lot of difference besides the weaker library of games and apps i really think that the pico 4 is a way best option if you want a vr headset definelly not a master upgrade if you are coming from quest 2 but for sure a best hardware >>><<<can it play pavlov and hot dog horseshoes and handgrenades and blade and sorcery>>><<<do you need a pc to use it>>><<<i tried my friend quest 2 and pico 4 pico 4 lenses look much better and the out of the box strap the balanced weight give superior experience >>><<<i liked the headset for its features but in some ways it is simply the better option because it had the advantage of being a new headset vs a 2 year old headset and vr tech moves pretty quickly the pico 4 is 430 euro and the quest 2 is 300 euro which makes the pico 4 a bit more of a tough sell i also prefer the more fine tuned software of the quest 2 but for pure pcvr the pico 4 is the better one but is it worth the 130 euro extra not sure especially with the quest 3 approaching >>><<<i was not sure about the pico 4 as i already had a meta quest 2 but about a month ago i decided to take the plunge and buy one hey i am so glad i did as it is leaps and bounds better than my quest 2 so much so i ended up selling it the one thing i regret knowing what i know now is that i should of made the switch to pico 4 sooner anyone on the fence and not sure do not be you will not be dissapointed oh your light issue maybe as you say your face shape as i have had no light coming through at all complete darkness you can also get a small adaptor for a headset only cost gbp3 dollar4 ebay>>><<<can i be a pin please >>><<<if i was not already planning on investing in psvr2 then this definitely seems like something i would be interested in>>><<<vr is fantastic one thing i always tell people before they pull the trigger on any vr is to do research on what they want out of their headset and what experiences they want to get out of it i am not sure how the pico marketplace looks but hopefully its comparable to the meta quest store and the application selection is decent thanks for your insight from your time using it >>><<<great video lono keep up the great work>>><<<seems like a pretty legit unit for the price if i did not get motion sickness i would probably pull the trigger on it >>><<<actually did not even think about the space aspect ans how itd benefit being truely wireless but your coverage of this device has been pretty tip top dude>>><<<what a bad unboxing video >>><<<vr is great i have been playing since the original rift horror games are my favorite horror just hits different in vr >>><<<thanks for the full unboxing and showing me everything in the box i am just buying this headset now and wondering what i am going to get you skipped nothing in the entire thing which i like conveniently this was uploaded 2 days ago as well my last headset was the rift s and i still have it but i am going wireless because i just love the idea of its portability and it is just the better headset upgrade also would like to tell you that walking dead saints and sinners is one of the only good horror vr games in my opinion it is got some rough things to get it running perfectly but it is a great game once it works right i am already big into steamvr and pcvr and also recommend you play a modded skyrimvr someday in your life the absolute best vr game i have ever played because well skyrim is my favorite game ever made >>><<<yoooo lono well well well was not yah one of those turned out on vr motion sickness whatever just kidding lol glad you found fun in the vr ecosystem and is super sweet folks are reaching out to yah to check this stuff out xd for some the barrier to get into vr is kinda huge i get it plus some of the experiences available surely are sketchy but when its good is actually awesome hope you like playing around w it for me space themed games are the most fun headsets usually feel like wearing a helmet or breather mask so it gets immersive organically  cheers homie xd>>><<<great video the all in one aspect is great my daughter was listening to the video as i am making dinner she said you should get that lol >>><<<as my source for game play and gaming news i was excited to see you get the pico 4  i am looking forward to seeing the performance of an all in one system as that makes a purchase much more straight forward please keep us up to date on the play tests >>><<<vr is not a niche market anymore it seems like every time you turn around somebody got a vr headset coming out really glad and excited>>><<<looks like a quest 2 just a bit updated >>><<<looking forward to seeing how it performs any ideas on what games your going to test out >>><<<please play the final fantasy 16 demo people are saying it is the best demo they ever played>>><<<interested to see some gameplay on this vs things like the quest 2>>><<<fancy little gadget >>><<<looks pretty slick been thinking about getting some vr think it is better then the ps5 vr >>><<<>>><<<been looking around options for a vr headset looking forward to seeing the review >>><<<tighten up lono need that gameplay lol can not wait to see this one >>><<<now i am member i am going to see what i have missed>>><<<cool looking headse it is kinda exciting to see vr take off in the way that it has>>><<<back>>><<<gg on the review i can not wait to see you play some games >>><<<looking forward to seeing you use the pico and review it >>><<<great review reforge >>><<<this unit looks interesting>>><<<love the double camera angle more unboxing vids pls >>><<<oh em gee i can not believe it is an actual pico 4 >>><<<excited to hear about this>>><<<i could never use headphones in vr because im always doing dropkicks and people is elbows in vrchat>>><<<bruh ur just sh tting on the quest 2 for the weight and it was only lighter if guest 2 had the comfy strap>>><<<i know this is a year later i just bought my first vr last week being the meta quest 2 i thought it was amazing for my first go with vr but i hated the strap for comfort always moving on my head unless i made the strap so tight sadly after only 3 days of use i plugged in the charge cable on day 3 and it actually broke the inside connection in the headset and no longer charges i sent it back today for a refund now i cannot decide if i got a poorly made headset in the factory or i was unlucky now seeing this video i am thinking of getting the pico 4 instead i will say i am single and wow when i watched adult content on the meta quest 2 it actually blew me away i am guessing the pico 4 can do the same and i can transfer movies onto the headset hard drive and watch it i was thinking of going for the meta quest 3 but the price any help would be gladly appreciated thank you >>><<<here in finland pico 4 it is 390euros 128 and quest 2 339euros 128 gb>>><<<reasons why to not get the pico 4 you can not play gorilla tag on it theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100dollar while pico costs 430dollar and its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can not do anything about it>>><<<hi i am thinking of getting either one but i am looking to just replace my monitor i wana play games like soccer football and simcity so basically what is best to just get a virtual desktop >>><<<lets play vtol vr together>>><<<my son got a pico 4 from santa an i have to say its awesome  i found some settings on youtube an tried them out an its way more crisper but super job an hes so haply with it but thsy should cross platform with quest on more games as my son can only play with some of his on their quest 3z on a few games  but im happy with it >>><<<man this video is absolutely superb one of the best comparison videos i have ever seen thank you >>><<<well quest it is because pico does not ship to australia great>>><<< do not buy a pico as they are connected to tiktok amp other shady chinese companies >>><<<debate for pico or for quest please >>><<<if it was not for the fact pico 4 library is way more limited and empty i would surely take it over the quest i am in a stalemate between both headsets now >>><<<how is it for watching movies want to use a vr headset for watching movies to block out all distractions>>><<<i got the quest 2 and maybe i kinda will get pico 4>>><<<so did anything change these past 11 months regarding pico 4 is it something that gets updates or is it a neglected product >>><<<quest2 >>><<<can you play poker stars on pico4 >>><<<it is so hard now what headset to use when you start with vr there is no perfect headset and all of them are super expensive the announcement of the quest 3 just made it harder personally i only care about re4 when going standalone 99percent of the time would be used in pcvr the only productivity i would wanna use is using a whiteboard in vr which probably also works on pcvr >>><<<pro controllers are like add me to the headset quest wins cause the pro controllers>>><<<why no image comparison >>><<<oculus software sucks my headset no longer connects to my phone and there 0 troubleshooting to help temporarily quest did not allow me to update games once they update they just restarted the oculus also will not let me change internets almost all of the time then randomly the menus buttons work controller have extreme stick drift the worst part about all of quest is that the headset i am talking about now was my 3rd headset the other 2 broke>>><<<could i wear glasses when wearing any one ofe them>>><<<any recent update about pico games >>><<<quest 2 got much cheaper>>><<<neither one is owned by a billionaire lizardman in a human skin trying to take over the world and the other one is owned by the chinese communist party trying to control everyone >>><<<dude your voice gives your bias away laughing at the one that you do not like isnt something a reviewer that is attempting to seem unbiased should be doing smh all you did was tell me that i should ignore your conclusion >>><<<quest2 is dollar300 and basically same specs if your gonna spend over dollar400 just wait for a quest 3 for dollar500>>><<<guys help what should i buy pico 4 or quest>>><<<ok that is an amazing comparison but now that i know that computer games need to be plugged in to your computer if i will play only computer games should i pick the pico4vr or maybe would be better an ar glasses i would like to have an immersive experience which would you choose >>><<<no the oculus quest 2 cost less>>><<<did the ui of pico 4 develop from the date of the video and if yes by how much >>><<<i like much meta oculus quest 2>>><<<thank you i have looked for comparing like this but you say something about mixed reality do they both support windows mixed reality >>><<<which middleclass boy is watching like >>><<<i want to buy vr i am new help me which one should i buy>>><<<you can actually play beat saber now on the pico 4 i think >>><<<to me the biggest selling point of a pico 4 is not needing a facebook account to use it tbh that is the only reason why i keep my facebook account open >>><<<what is this flight simulator you flew the a320 in >>><<<terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2>>><<<focused on entertainment pico can not even stream netflix of disney plus what a fail >>><<<i put my pico 4 on a grizzly bear at woburn zoo it started spinning around and bumped into a tree which it then climbed up and it never came back down >>><<<from my research i found out that the quest 2 is overall better for steam vr what do you think >>><<<does the pico 4 support ideal payment in the netherlands or would i need something else to buy virtual desktop>>><<<i just want to watch 3d videos in vr please suggest which vr among those two should i buy>>><<<pico wins simply because of the pancake lenses and auto ipd setting>>><<<now for the 256gb quest 2 it is euros480 >>><<<pico 4 vs quest 2 drop the coment >>><<<my quest two broke and i got my money back now i think ill get pico insted>>><<<unless you have a decent pc to use them with neither one >>><<< 5 03 krlh is that wesker will wesker show up >>><<<quest 2 is comfort level is like an instrument of torture compare to pico lol i do not get why there are many reviews rating quest 2 on top >>><<<what is the name of that fitness app >>><<<i just fucking hate the quest 2 controllers they interfere to often when gaming especially in shooters i am so glad the pico got tha arcs going back buying that>>><<<meh bring back oled also the audio on the pico 4 is quite poor>>><<<this video came in very useful as i now know which headset to go for it is the psvr2 btw >>><<<what game was that with the plane >>><<<is the hardware open like osvr with psco 4 so you can emulate spoof other vr headset o love having control over my hardware as a feel vr is like a tv yet they treat it like a game systen >>><<<i am sticking with the quest 2 there are so many accessories for the quest 2 and it is way more comfortable than pico 4 i think there are even charging docks tho it will feel expensive but trust me its worth it>>><<<if you go for 120 on the quest you get choppy frames so it does not really win in that argument >>><<<would pico 4 be a good vr headset for f1 games >>><<<can you play online white your friends if you have an pico 4 and they have an oculus>>><<<after using the pico 4 its a torture to use quest 2 both out of the box no accessory comfort and visuals pico wins hands down >>><<<nice review but it is quite baffling that you never mentioned the display clarity difference between the 2 or screen door effect or black levels is not that important the display quality >>><<<can i play pavlov via steam vr on pico 4 >>><<<seems a huge miss is no comparison of one of the biggest things image and video quality >>><<< 5 53 when he switched clips it felt very trippy so i think pico is more realistic >>><<< 3 29 him doing that and me feeling very smooth >>><<<i bought quest 2 recently after watching this comparison video i think quest 2 better with kiwi elite strap>>><<<quest 2 is not a good headset i actually sold mine because the head strap is horrible and the graphics are terrible on the quest two it is so terribly blurry probably because of the horrid foveated rendering and not to mention the shitty ipd adjustment with only 3 fixed adjustments it is a very lackluster headset honestly for the amount you pay and lastly the controller rings are too thick so whenever your playing and you slam your hands together you will be absolutely shitting yourself while you slowly look and find out if you have broke the controllers but apart from those issues which made the quest 2 unplayable for me it is a extremely well made headset with lovely tracking>>><<<hello i have a question can we play with meta quest players  i have a pico 4>>><<<is their gorilla tag on pico 4 >>><<<is hitman vr in epic games launcher compatible with the pico 4 >>><<<pcvr still the best>>><<<>>><<<thx for excelent presentation do you have the name of the the flightsim app the one with airliner >>><<<is the star wars and blade and sorcery game on pico 4>>><<<i use my quest 2 since day one and i never jad any problem with th strap just have to set up properly hoewer psvr is more comfortable but quest was hurting your neck what i never had that problem ever >>><<<it is something i have been wondering for a long time and that is if its possible to play gorilla tag on the pico 4 without pcvr steamvr>>><<<did they get rid of the bugs on the pico4 >>><<<i think that the quest 2 is way more cooler but pico is really okay and better for people who do not have 500dollar or have a facebook account oh godd >>><<<uh hi i have a question well i have not a vr headset and i will buy one for gaming and fitness and it is need to be good quality because i want watch videos on it wich one should i buy my budget 0dollar 460dollar already thanks for letting me know what is you think bye >>><<<pico with no head phone jack is a deal breaker for me >>><<<if ur just wanting a new vr headset or thinking of upgrading just wait quest 3 will most likely come out later this year or next year>>><<<so what should i get i eant my vr for gaming and some pc gaming >>><<<pico 4 does not have bone lab so you should buy a quest2 with a battery strap >>><<<i like the quest because it has gorilla tag>>><<<is gorilla tag on pico 4 >>><<<one missing comparison is the privacy policy both headsets record your home so it is important to dive in there both companies have been in the news for privacy invasions so this is the most deciding factor for me all other differences are minor really >>><<<the image scale for playing in pcvr is that much different betwen these vrs even considering quest 2 having more options for resolution >>><<<its a shame that none of the headset support steam native so you can buy games on a single platform i used to have a htc vive and have a bunch of vr games already on steam so having to connect the headset to my old pc to play these is a shame hardware wise the pico 4 seem to be much better and even cheaper >>><<<pick is owned by bytedance which is tiktok if you thank facebook is an evil company your not going to like bytedance the pico is likely gathering data and sending it to china>>><<<not sure your correct about meta quest 2 exclusive games not available on pico 4 technically you are right as they are not natively available to install stand alone but when you say you can not play these games on pico 4 that is not correct most of these games are available via pcvr >>><<<pico 4 is just a copy>>><<<can you play rec rom on pico 4 >>><<<i like to play beat saber it is about the only game i play the pro is not for me >>><<<ya what do i do i have i am going to get one but which one because i want to play beat star and i want

wish it was available in the usa >>><<< 1 46 wow look at that how much smaller is the pico 4 compared to quest 2 and how much the lenses of pico 4 are bigger than quest 2 so good i guess pico 4 should be a good buy >>><<<pico 4 is a direct copy of the oculus quest 2 >>><<<thanks very informative comparison does anyone know if the pico 4 will also stream cast to a google chromecast >>><<<i want to get one vr which good pico and quest 2  >>><<<if you want to do anything in vr do not get the quest pro it has an hour and a half long battery life new >>><<<does the pico 4 support vrchat asking for

ugly that is only my opinion>>><<<productivity doesnt have to be tied to mixed reality i remember the oculus rift had some cool drawing apps in vr so the same will likely be achievable on the pico 4 >>><<<quest 2 can be set to have higher resolution>>><<<it makes sense that the pico 4 only has 90hz since they have the same prosessor but quest 2 has lower resolution>>><<<question can these vr headset replace our pc monitor can i use it as a pc monitor so i can work or even play a movie from my pc and it will display on the vr >>><<<hi i am thinking about to buy pico only for steam vr games which one should i buy the 128gb or 256gb thanks for the vid >>><<<how do you play to flight simulator wired wireless with pico 4 utility or virtual desktop because another tester said that fs with pico 4 and virtual desktop require a huge hardware because even with a rtx 3080 it will lag at higher settings i mostly play elite dangerous and project cars 2 with a quest first gen and virtual desktop and i do not know if i should get pico 3 link with it is displayport or pico 4 with it is pancake lenses and better resolution but no displayport >>><<<i am only going to be using pcvr in this case would it be better to use virtual desktop or the default pico streaming app >>><<<if i buy games on steam can i still play on pico 4 >>><<<if i got a pico 4 could i play with my friends on quest 2 >>><<<my local shop meta quest 2 350dollar pico 4 520dollar man>>><<<my advice would be buy a second hand quest 2 for the next 6 to 12 months and when the quest 3 releases you buy that one if you already own a quest 2 then just wait for the 3 >>><<<my advice would be buy a second hand quest 2 for the next 6 to 12 months and when the quest 3 releases you buy that one if you already own a quest 2 then just wait for the 3 >>><<<pico 4 vs quest 2 bro already got them in the video >>><<<what is simulator on 6 42 aerofly >>><<<what should i buy for games quest 2 or pico 4 >>><<<if we compare the software between the two what does pico lack today that quest have and how do prices move between both platforms or its the same cost finally do you think that these differences will disappear >>><<<is there a way you can use the quest controllers on the pico i think the pico controller is not doing great in positioning itsself>>><<<i already have the pico 4 but since my youtube feed is flooded with these comparisons and reviews might as well watch some my workplace has quest2 and i have my own pico4 and 3 link the 3 only temporarily anymore and the pico4 is just from another world if used standalone the battery life though need to use an external powerbank if planning to use for a longer time if someone thinking of getting a vr headset i would recommend pico4 for mostly standalone but if mostly pcvr well pico neo 3 link it is simply better the quest2 is arguably better standalone headset than pico3link but the pico 4 is so much better and there are maybe reasons to use quest2 over pico4 if pcvr is the main focus but in that case might as well go for pico3link the only reason i can think of to use quest2 now that there are options the pro controllers they cost 300dollar on top of the headset but seem to be so much better than well any other standalone headset controllers hm owning the quest2 already is another reason to keep using it it is by no means obsolete for new users and especially for a first time vr users pico 4 is better and i am not regretting getting it one bit >>><<<the most important thing you did not mention from what i see the pico 4 has an exact ipd setting and better lens as well as image quality in my case the difference is huge because the oculus quest 2 did not fit my ipd because i am 71mm setting the right ipd is the most important thing in vr>>><<<why did you not do a controller weight test >>><<<do not know about pico 4 but i do know for sure that quest 2 is crap and overhyped for no legit reason since i bought it once like a year ago and it was bad the 3d effect of quest 2 was meh the colors of the screen were off a bit lcd and the fov was really limiting even quest 1 has better fov than it the controllers also were not as comfortable compared to quest 1 is controllers which are perfect hence why i sold my quest 2 and went back to my old quest 1 >>><<<being a spanish talker from south america pico is a horrible name xd mean peak nor in slang in some latin countries it means dick xd>>><<<is the pico neo 4 available in california >>><<<pico obviously copied the quest 2 they re stooopid to have brought it out it s non innovative i ll only upgrade my quest2 in 2 years from now or if apple comes out with their version of vr  ar why would anyone in their right minds upgrade to a pico 4 i meant pinnocchio 4>>><<<wow seeing you touching the switches in the a320 cockpit with the hand tracking made me buy this pico 4 haha>>><<<i want it but i am still not sure should i is it better than quest 2 >>><<<if you are new in vr you should get pico 4>>><<<what is the maximum length of the cable that can be used to link the pico 4 to the computer >>><<<this was a good review btw do you think pico 4 is high resolution enough for being use like a virtual monitor desk for having multiple 1080p monitors i hope the pancakes lenses are way better for that gt lt >>><<<the quest is expensive in europe got mine for dollar450 cad which is about 330 euro cool to know>>><<<quest 2 has beat saber why buying a vr headset without the best vr game there is >>><<<you mentioned both devices can watch youtube how did you manage to get youtube running on pico 4 netflix also seems to hit the drm black screen issue any advice thanks >>><<<i say find a used 1 or w8 for quest 3>>><<<i feel like no beat saber is a big draw away from switching for some people>>><<<hey guys i am just thinking about buying my first vr headset i am thinking about pico 4 more sice i will play pc vr mostly but since i never had any vr headset i do not know how all this sw works i understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms but let is say i want to play beat saber i can play it via pcvr but what about lone echo somewhere i came across information that quest games can be run normally on pc via their app and then streamed to the headset via vr desktop so is it possible to play quest 2 exclusive games this way on pico 4 or do i have to resign myself to losing these games >>><<<can i play steam vr on the pico 4 so that i could play beatsaber >>><<<would the pico 4 be a good choice to play elite dangerous >>><<<heyy where is this setting at 05 55 in the quest 2 >>><<<there is me still with the og quest>>><<<omfg the pico 4 has no headphone jack f ck that >>><<<get the pico 4 just do it >>><<<my birth

quest >>><<<none one is 2 years old another is marginally better than a two year old >>><<<i have quest 1 since its release and i will be getting pico 4 for sure i rarely if ever play quest games mainly using it for pcvr so i will not be missing anything software wise going for the pico >>><<<the only real question i need is can the pico 4 use vr chat if yes i am sold>>><<<does pico 4 works most of pc vr games just like quest 2 thanks>>><<<how noticeable is the fov increase can i play onward vr on this >>><<<my ipd is 55 trying to find a vr headset that will work >>><<<i had the original rift then the quest 1 it is passed time to upgrade and i was hoping for good things from the quest pro i am quite disappointed with the pro for the price but will see it in person first the quest 2 is not much of an upgrade over the quest 1 and i find it hard a hard jump to make but switching to the pico 4 may be a good idea i only have gbp100 worth of games worth keeping that i would have to rebuy on the pico but i want to edge over to steam anyway what is the pico like with glasses and how is the pc wifi connection for it my quest 1 cable connection is crap >>><<<no need for the video pico dominates hardware wise quest 2 dominated only because of better ui and it is facebook meta cmon>>><<<really no mention on clarity or fov when talking about gaming or movies only comfort or apps nothing about virtual desktop for streaming too bad >>><<<so there is no netflix app on the pico 4 right why is that >>><<<one thing to note here is that meta is commited to vr while pico is a new company that might give up in a couple of years with the leak of quest 3 it makes even less sense to buy pico 4>>><<<what about developer mode in pico4 does it easily allow any outside sources >>><<<there is no easy choice here unless you do pcvr exclusively there is so many advantages on both sides i wish i could have the hardware of the pico with the software of the quest sounds like what a quest 3 should be at minimum>>><<<where porno vr i want buy pico 4 for porno vr for pornhub >>><<<is the image quality youtube video netflix disney etc better on the pico 4 >>><<<pico 4 >>><<<i am probably gonna say quest all the way through>>><<<does the pico 4 have bigscreen >>><<<pico has released a competition against quest 2 but they failed to realise next gen is around the corner and quest will blow them out of the water to stay in this market pico will be the scraps that appeals to poor folk who are pedantic>>><<<even though pico is better it is still tik tok so i will not touch it with a 10 foot pole if anyone is gonna steal my data i prefer it to be usa not china>>><<<is the fov much of an improvement on the pico 4 >>><<<you said quest 2 has low quality camera and pico 4 doesnt have 3d but then you gave the win to pico thats biased you also said its okay pico 4 doesnt have 3 5 jack like quest 2 but thats okay and thats also biased you said you can use blutooth but anyone who tried connecting to quest 2 blueooth will know how there is a full 1 second delay which makes gaming broken>>><<<for a cheap and way better option than the elite strap get the bobovr m2 pro it has a waaaay better strap and it includes a battery pack that is magnetically attached to the back of the strap serves as both a counterweight and a 5000 mah battery i have been having a blast with it and it so easy to switch out batteries mid gaming session>>><<<does pcvr via usb picture quality look much better than wireless streaming>>><<<how is the delay on the pico with wireless pcvr >>><<<bluetooth headset to get fully immersed worst advise i have heard considering it is not aptx >>><<<is it possible to have a link cable to your pc with pico 4 because you are saying that but i am reading on internet that is not possible >>><<<thank you very informative do you know which games on steam optimize for the pico 4 >>><<<great comparison i guess ill wait for oculus 3 to come out since i have lots of games in my quest 2 and i do not want to buy it again for pico 4 >>><<<is there really no way to play oculus store games on pico4 >>><<<i want a quest 2 for christmas >>><<<in my testing of pico 4 a few things were a deal breaker to me 1 light bleed from the sides of the face shield was obnoxious 2 the hard foam that face shield was uncomfortable and cheap feeling 3 the lenses are pancake but they are really high reflectivity which makes for a not so great experience every time light blead is present 4 color saturation is worse than q2 which is sad because the ppd is higher and the clarity is no match >>><<<i guess chineese headset that noone heard about is competing and winning against over hiped oculus is a major meta failure that can not be recovered>>><<<for me the pico 4 is very uncomfortable compared to the quest 2 there is massive light leakage on the side and the headset jams into my rather large nose i also can not get a clear picture unless i tilt the headset up slightly so all the pressure is on my forehead i had the same issue with the vive focus 3 i think mark z has a similar head shape to me which is why the meta devices always seem to fit me better  i think having multiple fit kits at launch is crucial for vr vendors comfort is so important >>><<<quest 2 software is better but for us living in china without vpn it is absolute bare bones as well everything is unusable >>><<<some people play the quest with regular strap this guy just said if u add something to quest 2 it is heavier so pico is lighter wtf this makes me think this comparison is not objective but when it comes to comparing the straps then he uses default quest 2 straps but not for the weight>>><<<so i have the quest2 and will however buy the pico4 as well and a friend of mine who did not have a headset at all is also going to get the pico4 about the weight to get the quest2 balanced you need a counterweight which i use with the bobovr headstrap with battery it works very well but then the pico4 has its advantage it is lighter and already balanced from start i saw another video from mrt where sebastian demonstrated the bobovr battery set for the pico4 that you can attache above the original battery pack it makes the headset heavier but the way he said it is not a big deal because the extra weight is on the back of your head so far everything i see from the pico4 is good news i play most games as pcvr games with my quest so i can use the pico4 as well for it but fitness i do also with the quest and those are native to the quest  that is why i will not get rid of the quest so soon besides it is always good to have a second machine as a backup >>><<<just get the pico neo 4 no debate unless you want to wait next year for the quest 3>>><<<what about 3d movies or 4k movies transferred from my hdd to the internal memory of both headsets >>><<<can you run google earth vr on pico4 the pico4 not support webxr right anyone has the us or eur rom to flash >>><<<is not it possible to play the already bought oculus games using pcvr >>><<<i love my quest big turn off for me about the pico is no mic plugin and no way to change the straps plus the company who owns tik tok bought them so if you thought facebook was spying on you imagine what these guys are doing>>><<<why not both>>><<<i do not understand why headsets do not come with detatchable batteries apart from the obvious advantage for the user it would mean another accessory they could make money from >>><<<you did not cover privacy which i would think is a very important issue facebook has a horrible track record do not run for political office if you use an meta device zuck will sell your data in a heartbeat bytedance well who knows possibly they are sending everything you do back to china and sharing your usage habits with the ccp i am not sure would be worse is there an anonymous mode with the pico 4 or in picoos in general or can you just make a disposable email account and sign up anonymously are pico devices going to require a tiktok account we already know that facebook is forcing all the oculus go users to connect their vr headsets to the facebook accounts by the end of the year or have them disabled the pico 4 is well timed for all those casual users to jump ship or is it actually jumping it feels like meta is making us walk the plank >>><<<i am deciding on quest 2 or pico 4 just to play pc games on steam but if there is no plan on a pico 4 cable link then quest 2 is in favour >>><<<so i am a little confused regarding pico linking to pc i read you can only play pc games via air link with no cable but on your video i see an option to link to pc via cable so if there is cable link capability will it be usb or display port cable straight to graphics card great video >>><<<so if i plug the pico 4 into my pc via usb c can i access the oculus store for games or only the steam store and are there many more games that are exclusive on the oculus store and not on steam >>><<<is it worth going from an index only the headset to the pico 4 for wirless and sharper immage >>><<<for me there is no quest 2 or pico 4 for me is quest 2 and pico 4 >>><<<does the pico have a video player similar to skybox >>><<<not even close enough of a jump in tech to warrant a purchase for existing q2 owners without even talking about the library and having to buy again  huuuuuuuuge pass>>><<<i am waiting for the lynx r1 to drop for the reviews for deciding between the 3 thing is in a recent update if you preorder the lynx r1 now it will arrive like in march even tho the first units start shipping in november >>><<<does this have better contrast ratio aka black levels than the quest 2 >>><<<for pcvr how is the visual impression of the wireless vd streaming of pico in comparison to quest especially far details like trees in skyrim for example would be interesting to know and also of course how it is in comparison to a good pcvr headset like the g2 or so  great video btw pretty high quality i hope your channel will fly >>><<<for productivity i thing better resolution allows for better reading experience and comfort allows for longer sessions>>><<<it was a nice review and much better than what anyone else had shown it is massively disappointing that i assume pico blocked full compassion videos to quest 2 until now i guess where i now do not trust previous vr reviewers pico had made so many red flags with no mention of pcvr clearly not allowing quest vs pico reviews from early reviewers the actual full weight no aduio jack the actual fov dropping the display port poor inbuilt software streaming and how the motorized ipd works which is a gimmick i have a quest 2 but also a pico4 pre ordered just for the comfort for pcvr watching movies and with higher resolution i do not think the pico4 is a clear winner but still a winner if trying to decide to waste amp upgrade 1500 euro on a quest pro if that ends up being the price or 400 euro on a pico 4 besides its downsides i still think pico4 is the way to go this xmas if you do not mind the exclusives that will be missed from meta but since meta has the majority of the market standalone on quest may end up getting better than expected >>><<<another helpful video on the p4 thank you did you notice any discomfort on your cheekbones or forehead from it >>><<<good short comparison that mentions all the important points one small addition to the pico os ui experience and you mentioning that quest 2 has a two year headstart that is not entirely correct at release they will ship it with pico os 5 and already used earlier versions on older headsets like neo 3 it is just a smaller software dev team compared to meta but hopefully with the bytedance acquisition and financial backing pico will up their game >>><<<does running pcvr games via wi fi virtual desktop run as well as a link cable direct to the computer like the quest 2 is the image quality going to be as good using the pico 4 usb c cable compared to the direct link cable of the quest 2 pros and cons >>><<<i want to buy pico 4 but i do not know when or if it will be released in india >>><<<i do not get the hype over the pico they copied the same design as the quest mixed with rpo and knowing that the quest has been out for years should have given tons of time to get their software and hardware in order before launch the pico should have been better then the quest but they just tried to make it slightly better with a color passthrough and a very small selection of games i doubt this thing will catch on >>><<<any issues with light bleed on the side of the cushion of pico 4 >>><<<question how weak is your neck o i have a halo strap with a battery and also had the default strap prior playing until the quest was flat but never had any neck strain >>><<< 58mm ipd will crush your nose half the population has an ipd lower then 62mm so there is going to be al lot of crushed noses then >>><<<a bit odd that virtual desktop was not mentioned for pc streaming since for the pico 4 it makes quite a difference compared to the current version of the streaming assistant of course it does cost a bit of money and it is a 3rd party app but i do think it is worth a mention at least as long as the streaming assistant does not measure up to that yet >>><<<yeah americans helping china steal our r amp d>>><<<both of these are flawed if i did not have a quest 2 already i think i would be waiting for the psvr 2 that one destroys both of these because it is oled >>><<<how stable is guardian for big area >>><<<does pico 4 charge while playing pc games with cable >>><<<i am playing pcvr only through steam worth spending 430 on pico 4 to switch from quest 2 >>><<<what was that flight sim you were playing in the pcvr review i have been looking for good vr alternatives other than vtol xplane and msfs what is the name of this game and is it built for vr >>><<<this questions is answered vaguely at best will i be able to play my steam games on the pico 4 through a usb c cable >>><<<i still do not think we have seen anyone actually test the pico running pcvr via usb c is it available yet >>><<<i heard bad things about the controller position not be accurate on the pico 3>>><<<neither because neither has displayport >>><<<live faq  can i still play beat saber on the pico 4 yes via pcvr you can still play beat saber  what do you mean by automatic ipd adjuster i meant to say motorized ipd adjuster  do i have a weak neck try to play a combat flight simulator for 2 hours wit 800 grams on you head can the pico 4 ipd go lower than 62mm yes it can go as low as 58 mm you just have to acknowledge a notification warning you that the lens edges might press against your nose and potentially cause discomfort at lower ipds thanks soundbubble>>><<<bruh i need the pico get 120 fps>>><<<the stock quest 2 strap made my neck hurt after awhile too i got a dollar20 elite style strap off amazon and my neck feel much better now it balances much better >>><<<already pre ordered pico 4 and can still play beatsaber and some oculas stuff with virtual desktop >>><<<also i thought disney plus and prime werent on the quest 2>>><<<can you still play beat saber on pico 4 via steam i know it isnt a feature yet but they will add virtual desktop soon so will it work then>>><<<pico has a motorised stepless ipd adjustment but it is not automatic>>><<<the pico 4 ipd adjustment actually goes from 58mm 72mm not 62mm 72mm you just have to acknowledge a notification warning you that the lens edges might press against your nose and potentially cause discomfort at lower ipds and larger noses vr essentials made a video demonstrating it a few days ago >>><<<great content >>><<<why open xr is not suuported by pico 4 why pico4 controllers are not working on half of steam vr games >>><<< >>><<<i signed up for the jmancurly giveaway for the peco 4>>><<<looks like a rip off of the quest

know how>>><<<please make medal of honor above and beyond come to pico store as standalone>>><<<pico4 is awesome kudos to the team behind this fantastic hardware at this price range when chillout vr standalone comes out i am going to buy two more for my parents patiently hoping for vrchat standalone too >>><<<disconnecting controllers does it mean we can get non official or custom controllers >>><<<and where are the step by step instructions they showed an advertisement and that was all  >>><<<china is currently selling the enterprise as a the pico 4 pro is there anything stopping me from buying one as a consumer for the eye and facial tracking for pc vr >>><<<pico please add beat saber to the pico store>>><<<are you releasing this in the us yet >>><<<man i want this>>><<<what is the price >>><<<pico if you were smart you would release this product to the public to gain more market since in meta they were calmer knowing that this product was only for companies and they are increasing the sales of their meta quest pro for one reason you can use their headset for gaming or business anyone can buy it while this one cannot be bought by anyone who wants to play games on it >>><<<>>><<<i would definitely buy this over quest pro if released for sale to the public do it pico >>><<<when exactly cost >>><<<finally>>><<<love this review i was kinda regreting buying the pico 4 but now i know what it can do>>><<<my friend gave me a pico 4 gaming headset >>><<<best all round imo pankake lenses are game changers for clarity  light weight but has some aspects that need adressing thge face shield needs replacing with amvr but thats cheap the audio ports are nowhere near your ears currently designing and 3d printing ear enclosured for it picoear available soon >>><<<wow it is cheap 429 for a headset >>><<<this is a bad buy its owned by the ccp bytedance bytedance is a unsafe ompany to buy things >>><<<made it back>>><<<i have noticed there are a lot of dutch vr content creators quite cool imo>>><<<pico is like slim quest2 >>><<<awesome video but please lose the music>>><<<how does the recline mode works does it allow me to play vr while laying down in bed >>><<<i bought one and returned a day later dealbraker for me is that the screen door effect is very noticeable for me i come from a rift cv1 that has half the resolution and yes screen door effect is less on the pico 4 but it was still there and different also playing with the stream assistant and usb c cable a lot of stuff was not working took me 3 hours to get sound hand gestures yes the controllers have capacitive buttons and sticks did not work in half life alix the tracking was a lot worse than the cv1 so having a new headset that is for me less fun than a 7 year old headset just does not cut it for me >>><<<how is it comparing to oculus quest 2 >>><<<ooo he speaks dutch>>><<<thank you mr laubox >>><<<can you charge while playing >>><<<its insane how much and how to the detail they had copy the oculus quest product its pretty disgusting >>><<<cool headset but what about custom lenses >>><<<great review thanks >>><<<after years of playing oculus rift or at least own it i decided to give pico 4 a try my experience is very subjective and i have only had the rift to compare to personally it was not as amazing as i imagined it my oculus rift imo has the best strap ever created and it almost feels like i am not wearing a headset after a few hours pico 4 however felt stiff in the cushioning and it also revealed that i am disfigured because no matter what i did the headset kept putting pressure on the top of my nose bone to the point it began to hurt if i manage to put it in a spot where it does not hurt i lost all clarity because it was too high up coming from regular gaming with 144hz and oculus tethered experience wireless is not the way to go for me i think too much latency and stutters after i realized i had to buy a new router just to be able to access wireless unless its as fluid as tethered i can not do it i am a pcvr only fella and i have no experience with other headsets apart from rift but i also felt that the clarity was only in the center of the screen and completely blurry at the edges heard its not uncommon but never really experienced that on my rift granted it was all pretty much blurry so might just not seen the difference xd looking down at my body in bonelabs it was just blur no crisp boobs to play with dx>>><<<we have quest 1 2 and this pico 4 honesty speaking this pico 4 is so far the best wireless headset we have tested much lighter in weight much better resolution and tracking accuracy very nicely comfortable>>><<<the longer i wait to buy a vr headset the happier i am i am not ready to jump in yet it seems like there is still another level of experience vs pricing to be ironed out before i do but with headset like this were definitively getting closer >>><<<the ui looks identical to the quest ui>>><<<you are gorgeous>>><<<my neck really needs this one >>><<<jesus christ loves you>>><<<would it make sense to get this it one did not have a gaming pc i have a ps5 but really want to move into a vr headset without the need of pc games would this be recommended still or should i look at the ps vr or meta 2 >>><<<very easy immediate no just by virtue of not being a halo style headset>>><<<definitely an exciting headset >>><<<my question is why is there no standalone headset with expandable storage seems like the nect quality of life thing any company could do and it wouldnt even cost them a lot also it would be easy to implement but i understand these companies just want your money so it probably wont happen that soon >>><<<so the quest 2 needs the oculus software installed on windows in order to run pc vr games on the oculus quest 2 the oculus software can not be installed on linux and without it installed the headset can not be used except for sideloading games does the pico 4 offer support for linux cause the are those of us that would love to play pc vr titles on the linux steamvr >>><<<the pc requirement is harsh >>><<<can you please show how good it is with full body tracking on vrchat >>><<<1200 pixel per degree is not that better than human eyes the fov must be really small >>><<<ill stick to my quest 2>>><<<i am waiting to see what the quest 3 will be like >>><<<hi bud great review clear and well presented you earned a sub i look forward to the revisit as i am sorely tempted question if you are reading this did you play beat saber and is it comfy and do you play with a claw grip or just normal hilt grip and what was your impressions billions of beat saber players need to know d>>><<<is it android i wonder if you could sideload a quest exclusive >>><<<boring vid >>><<<feels like auxiliary ports are becoming a thing of the past which is sad cause i am lucky to even remember to charge my phone >>><<<i just bought the quest pro because i wanted something with better weight balance for pcvr had i known about this i probably would have gotten it instead i am impressed with its library so far but i guess i want to wait anyway to see what valve and htc have coming up i really want a standalone steamvr headset no more walled gardens please >>><<<only downside i see with this is not being able to access oculus library its a bummer because this headset looks and sounds amazing a much lighter headset sounds like a godsend but having all my games on oculus theres no way im rebuying them all for pico >>><<<do i have to rebuy all the games i already bought in my quest 2 >>><<<so this or meta quest 2 which is better and why >>><<<very good work breaking down everything on the headset very helpful >>><<<does it cause motion sickness >>><<<can i play steamvr beat saber over wifi with this >>><<<meta is falling asleep especially after their announcement of quest pro this is definitely a worthy purchase >>><<<is the picture quality better on hardwire pcvr >>><<<if it does not have population one i am out >>><<<it looks like a rip off of the meta quest even the software ui  >>><<<if only i could transfer my games from quest i have already bought a ton of them >>><<<did you experience any latency using bluetooth headsets like in that rhythm game you played people think bluetooth always has bad latency but it can be pretty good depending on the device for instance on the steam deck it is perfectly fine can barely detect latency while on the quest 2 it is absolute dogshit and unusable >>><<<hello as first vr headset which one should i consider pico4 or quest2 can not wait for quest 3 mostly for standalone vr old gtx 970 >>><<<ruins my hair no buy >>><<<hi laubox can you please confirm if echo vr arena is playable on the pico 4 via virtual desktop please thankyou very much>>><<<ahh we are waiting for them to get cheaper not more fucking expensive than quest 2  and i just learned the news about quest pro costing 1500 dollar xdd fucking insanity is what this is my salary is as poor as it was last year so fuck your overpriced products  >>><<<interesting thanks >>><<<will sidequest games be compatible with these >>><<<its definitely the best piece of ccp spyware the company that makes it is owned by chinese govt >>><<<i already have a pico 8 >>><<< 8 41 what game is this >>><<<tethered pcvr is affected by battery i mean if the battery eventually dies can i still used it with my cable >>><<<if you want to us a wire to stream games is that an option it has no displayport cable only usb 3 and as far as i know usb 3 can not work like a display port cable i play vr for 5 hours and need the headset to be powered could i play using wifi and have the cable connected to charge the headset >>><<<you said absolutely nothing about the tracking fidelity arguably the most important aspect of any headset  bro >>><<<if i would not have bought my quest 2 and all my games on oculus i think i would have bought this one instead >>><<<i do not know i am still fine with my reverb g2 seems like a lot of the stuff this offers the g2 already does will probably upgrade once an 8k headset comes out using for dcs and il 2>>><<<the headset and hardware seems amazing but why does the software setup design menus and even the box have to look so similar to the quest even the activity ring is copy and paste from the apple watch activity ring it just give the impression that its just a oculus clone from a chinese company do not they have designer of their own >>><<<price same as oculus 2 so better buy oculus>>><<<this quality and editing is honestly unbelievable for such a small channel only a matter of time before this grows>>><<<very good review way better than many other more established vr youtubers  >>><<<this looks freaking awesome i love the size makes lone gaming sessions and going into scopes will be amazing>>><<<boku no >>><<<is this for watching boku no pico >>><<<wtf cost so much just an vr>>><<<when do it sell on amazon>>><<<how about discord >>><<<this is better than the quest in almost every way all it needs is more software especially the software people would want from a quest 2>>><<<sub par headset all the next gen are coming out soon and this one will definitely be left in the dust haha junk>>><<<i feel when choosing between facebook and the company behind tiktok i would much rather have the americans selling my data for add revenue than the chinese using it for god knows what  the devil you know >>><<<basically stole the entire ui from the meta quest >>><<<wow the price is hefty for a copy product should at least be half the price of quest 2>>><<<finally some competition love my quest but definitely need more players to drive the market>>><<<what is the game on 8 39 minutes >>><<<you are not the right person to review this because people end up looking at you rather than the object lol>>><<<ipd adjustment is motorized omg >>><<<i can see zucc sweating from where i am because this is some serious competition>>><<<are you dutch >>><<<question hmmmm  from other pico videos i thought the pico 4 could not be hardwired tethered to a usb port  only through the wifi dongle your video here is seems to be confusing on pcvr compatibility connections yes i would like to see videos on how well pcvr works with the pico 4 far as simulation racing and flight games i have on steam i currently use the oculus rift s for my vr gaming added ahhh  i need to see more video reviews on how well the streaming assistant works with the pico 4 for using pcvr is it good enough for playing my steam sim racing games i use with my rift s headset  thanks for the video review of pico 4 >>><<<if game market finna be comparable to quest 2 then imma switch for sure happy to see new and better headsets >>><<<why do they copy facebook metas ui though this headset is cool but they should be doing something more original software wise instead of just copying metas homework and saying it is their own >>><<<first you say you got something from a company then you tell it is for a honest review well look you must be a likable guy but companies do not give you something for a honest review so phrase it diffrently or get it from a friend or something cause if you really got it from the company then your not independent >>><<<interactive netflix youtube shows are the best in vr>>><<<this definitely seems like a good option definitely wanna get this also exited for that wireless dongle for pcvr where you would not need to use wifi>>><<<have you tried vr desktop with these i wonder because i am a software developer with a low budget and a shitty laptop>>><<<it is also important to remember this is a bytedance product and will come preloaded with a lot of spyware but so does the quest so take that as you will >>><<<1080p full color pass through video with hand tracking and eye tracking all for the price of the meta quest 2 im buying>>><<<kinda regretting getting the quest 2 now lol>>><<<but is not it the default skin>>><<<try dcs on this>>><<< in the head strap itself is the battery and the battery lasts for pretty long i was expecting something like lasts for about 4 hours fully charged or something not for pretty long or longer than a wouldie hard movie haha i guess a full charge is at least 1 day of gameplay then 4 8hrs >>><<<my guy are you cutting your fingernails with the headset on >>><<<the only thing i see being a big issue as someone who has played on quest for several years now is that i will have to repurchase so many games that i play consistently>>><<<i think quest 2 is still better>>><<<got any idea when it is to launch or come to india >>><<<i wonder if 120hz will be possible down the line >>><<<i really wish they would sell a pc only version i>>><<<i am fascinated by vr hoping to get an oculus quest 2 for christmas>>><<<honestly i just want linux compatible virtual desk application that would allow me to set up 3 screens in virtual space on remote desktop connect mouse and keyboard directly into the headset and do some work streaming via internet >>><<<i guess there is no way to get the quest games to pico is it just another environment with its own shop >>><<<i was interested but not being able to change the strap or to use an external battery if you want to use wired headphones yikes that is incredibly bad design i will stick with my quest 2 for a moment >>><<<look like you have a bra on your face pass>>><<<if its blurry and has a screen door effect nah >>><<<did i miss it or does it have some like quest guardian >>><<<does it charge while playing with the cable with quest 2 i can play for more than 8 hours with the cable connected as it is always connected i never have to charge my quest 2 >>><<<i feel the same thing about the brightness and colors of the quest 2 they are just not enough to me the screen is by far the worst thing about it it would be so much better with a nice and bright oled screen it has to be oled because horror games are completely unplayable in these terrible washed out lcd screens>>><<<as good as this is we can not neglect the unknown consequences of giving up even more of our privacy and behavior to chinese bytedance company>>><<<can a mac book air run pcvr for pico >>><<<if it had displayport it would be worth it >>><<<can it play natively or does it need the pc >>><<<the pico 4 has me really excited for competition in the vr market but i am honestly a little worried about the strap situation and so few people have even mentioned the downsides of it other than you part of what made the quest 2 so popular is the ability to switch out that strap when it breaks you want a new one or when your battery strap starts to degrade it made it more approachable for consumers that want some security with their purchase knowing so many things were interchangeable i just really do not wanna find out that after say 1 000 hours of use the ratchet breaks on everyone is headstrap with them all now out of warranty forcing people to just junk the thing heck even if we find their strap has the same issue that the original quest straps had loving the pico 4 and how it is looking thus far and can not deny the usefulness of a battery bank in the back to counterbalance but i am just worried about the potential downsides here even just the fact that 3rd party strap manufacturers are completely left out in this headset is equation could have simply been a snap on mechanism with metal magnetic contacts for power delivery but alas apparently not in their plans at the time i guess we will just have to wait and see what happens down the road for customers nice detailed review >>><<<percs of being a welder my neck doesnt get tired so i can play vr until i die>>><<< 9 19 ah wait so it does support pcvr via cable all of the other sources i have seen seemed to say that it does not am i misunderstanding something >>><<<great review laubox see ya soon on your twitch streams >>><<<if this blows up the yanks will simply sanction it to oblivion since this is a chinese product >>><<<would the pico 4 pc vr work without a dedicated router i just use my phone as modem for internet the mobo has wifi 5 >>><<<hopefully with this coming out the quest 3 will have a screen resolution as good as this or better i really like the design it seems like the ui was directly replicated from meta>>><<<this is oculus on steroids>>><<<this looks soooooo cool i am super excited to get a refresh on the quest 2 this one has 1200 ppi and the quest 2 has 773 so it will be clearer super excited to see comparisons between those 2 i just hope their version on link airlink is as good if not better would be nice if it could handle more bandwidth while decoding>>><<<what is the game at 10 07 looks cool>>><<<maybe i will get one when it lowers in price for now im good with my quest 2 as i have quite a few games on it >>><<<wait the pico 4 allows you to connect to pc with cable everyone on every platform said that that is not possible even the picoxr website said to connect via wifi 6>>><<<if it was available in the us already i would have already made an order tbh the quest 2 is nice and all being lighter than an index but still gets heavy after a while it would be nice having a headset that is much lighter >>><<<wtf is a euro not very considerate not translating what a euro is considering most us channels are considerate enough to also state international measurements celsius etc >>><<<nah i will take a cabled model >>><<<laubox is my favourite vr content creator top notch quality like always >>><<<hp you need 0 accaount>>><<<while the promising display better weight distribution magnetic facial interface and precision ipd adjuster is a leap forward the battery and sound controller being part of the headstrap is a massive turn off for me and prevents anyone from making an aftermarket replacement headstrap if they do not like the default one >>><<<it is just like quest 2 in another headset>>><<<no headphone jack is kind of a bag of shit how the hell are you supposed to charger it and use headphones at the same time >>><<<damn dude you do not have to smolder that hard with the headset on geeze you out here with your razor sharp jawline and those perfectly pouty lips >>><<< 10 13 what game is that >>><<<the graphics look the same so whats the point>>><<<laubox the friend with sp4zie laubox o i have randomly found you looking for reviews of the pico 4 d>>><<<looks great glad to see competition in the wireless headset marketplace>>><<<your bass audio is a little louddd>>><<<i really hope that this is an honest review when quest 2 came out there was so much crap spoken about it that it was an anti climax when i got hold of it i like to immerse myself in vr especially films q2 is shit for watching them the headset is too heavy if you attach an external battery as a counterweight you cannot sit down and relax without risking whiplash so i have just pre ordered this pico 4 and hope i can finally catch up with all the films i have that need to be watched on a big screen completely ignoring the fact that it will record everything it sees and send it back to its chinese masters >>><<<very informative review thank you i will be picking one of these up i bought a quest 2 for dollar300 fb or meta sucks i bought the dollar80 quest cable and a wifi 6 router and it still would not connect i quickly sold my quest to someone at work for dollar50 and then got a pimax do you know how much of an object that a pimax puts on your face its a massive object for a face to be having on it with a pico i can finally get back to playing beat sa i mean boneworks >>><<<if it has a separate 3 5mm jack it would be amazing not being able to charge and listen like in a sit down movie setting is a pretty big detractor and since latency is so important bluetooth for most things is off the table >>><<<more competition and more choices meta quest pro and apple vr headsets will cost beyond most people is budget so pico is quality price ratio is a very attractive choice>>><<<more competition and more choices meta quest pro and apple vr headsets will cost beyond most people is budget so pico is quality price ratio is a very attractive choice>>><<<do the controllers not come with straps >>><<<fov seems pretty crappy though right >>><<<just noticed how ready player one this looks lol>>><<<no replaceable strap is a red flag >>><<<currently in the middle of selling my quest 2 to purchase this really can not wait for this looks unreal>>><<<that fov doe do not underestimate the power of fov to drive immersion 105 in 2022 womp womp i get that it keeps it small and light but meh we need to get 180 >>><<<i have to admit the pico is extremely compelling for me i would consider myself to be a very casual vr player i currently have an odyssey 2 which i pick up from time to time i tried the quest 2 but returned it since the stock strap was so bad i know i know many different options out there etc but as i mentioned i am very casual and just really could not be bothered the fact that this seems so much lighter and display being better is extremely compelling hope they make a us release possible >>><<<how is this headset for people with a high nose bridge does it sit on the nose and cause discomfort or can you adjust the straps to avoid it >>><<<as with all headsets it comes down to the apps and software same here seems like a great q2 or ever q2 clone is it enough >>><<<is there a web browser on the pico4 and can it be used with pass through >>><<<damn it is looking good but buying same games again no>>><<<looks too good to be true hmm>>><<<i am enjoying my quest 2 for now but i will probably get something like that next year when cost comes down and tech advances another notch great video >>><<<this could easily replace my quest i hate everything about facebook meta giant and want to be as far as them as i can seems like this could be the answer >>><<<does this hmd for setup need any kind of app store application on your phone for the setup >>><<<man if only i had not spent a bunch on quest games i would buy this even though my games have been cross buy i can probably make it work through link somehow >>><<<literally the same thing to quest 2 but more expensive good review tho i would trade this in with my quest 2 if i had a pc>>><<<looks good but i will wait to see what kind of spying and info collection is tied to it >>><<<please make a video on pico 4 wired usb cable experience thank you >>><<<woooo i wish i would of waited for this and get this instead i have got quest 2 not so long ago >>><<<why does it function so much like a quest 2 that is so odd >>><<<except they excluded anyone under 62 ipd no thanks terrible>>><<<can you wear glasses with them thas a deal breaker for me>>><<<looks horrible >>><<<dead to me no displayport and i am mad would have been the best pcvr headset by milesssssss if it had displayport>>><<<i tought pico 4 did not have a cable for pcvr is this the case >>><<<not everyone has short hair alot of people wear buns and these straps make it impossible to sit comfortably on your head with long hair in general>>><<<you can not connect it via cable>>><<<pico 4 advantages  soc this product got a better soc than the meta quest 2 its the same soc but overclocked and got a better cooling soultion there is no information about the gpu specs of the soc but because there is better a cooling they logicly overclocked it and there is 8gb of ram with speed of 2133 mhz vs 6gb of ram with mhz of quest 2 screen the screen is better and there is no screen door effect anymore due to 2160x2160 pixel resolution per eye vs 1 832 x 1 920 pixel resolution of the quest 2 the screen is 72 hz and 90 hz which losing to quest 2 that got 72 hz 90hz and120 hz design the design of the pico 4 is slimmer and sexier elite strap is built in costs 60dollar for the quest 2 xd the vibration motor of the the controllers makes huge diffrence between the two comfort the most important for the mainstream user is the comfort because the elite strap included there is 300 grams in front and 300 grams in the back of the headset so no more discomfort due to inbalance in mass pc gaming due to no official support of cable they got a wifi streaming software its not the best and to fix it you will need to buy virtual desktop due to a better wifi module and antena the bandwith and the most important the ping the time it takes to the pc send the video information to the headset is awesome and now a wifi router in the other room will work perfect passthrough one more con of the pico 4 is the ar camera passthrough camera it is a 16mp rgb colored camera which is better then the black and white one on the quest 2 and got more pixels  disadvantages  there is no disadvantages just kidding xd  games there is a no games much games to play but its better than when the quest 1 launched so while people developing new games u will have time to finish the current games only if u arent living in vr and playing only 10 hours a week game server in the last pico is vr headset people had a problem with the ping latency because most of the servers were located in china mother of the greater son in the pico family little pico 4 comunity most of the comunity are communists chinese at the moment lets fix it pc gaming no cable support at the moment cyka blyat >>><<<boku 4 piko>>><<<1 basically a copycat of meta 2 no content 3 high risk of company being blocked in the us no thanks>>><<<does not touch my 3 year old index so  no >>><<<it sounds cool but i already have a quest and a lot of games on it so if i get this it would just do pretty much the same thing but i would have to buy more games for it>>><<<fuck this is really good now i regret buying my quest 2>>><<<psvr 2 will be the leading vr headset>>><<<minimum ipd 62 that sucks >>><<<is it better than quest 2 >>><<<this head set is not good at all thanks for reading this>>><<<does this have hand tracking >>><<<if there werent rumors of valve working on a standalone i would consider this one i am surprised there arent any lawsuits going around with how similar the ui is to the quests lol>>><<<clone of the oculus quest 2 did not impressed me at all >>><<<first vr headset that allows wireless pcvr gaming without a facebook account i am interested i have the oculus quest 2 but i also happen to work in china and it does not allow me to connect to the internet cannot update it anymore >>><<<in chile pico is pene>>><<<i am just waiting for prescription lens for this then i am buying>>><<<pichula>>><<<i will rather let americans steal my data so no thanks>>><<<>>><<<pcvr q usb c native display port or codec style like oculus>>><<<shame the standalone does not have vrchat >>><<<shame they didnt add 3 5 jack instead of front passthrough camera nice review tho>>><<<do i get pico 4 this christmas or get psvr2>>><<<i like to lay down watching movies can you lay down comfortably with the headset >>><<<honestly looks nice i did not know that steam had their own fr section i though only the valve stuff could use it >>><<<that ui is such an oculus ripoff>>><<<no 3 5 mm jack no oled panels no 120 hz refresh rate if the straps break then it is 500 euro brick i am sticking with quest 2 and will wait for project cambria hopefully facebook would deliver which this cannot may be pico 5 will be better still the video is very informative thanks>>><<<i am also guessing it is running android just a different more heavily modified version of it fun fact the quest does the same actually>>><<<this is probably the thing the quest should have been the slimness is really something>>><<<i never thought they would get to ready player one type slimness with the pico headset but i am surprised that they did >>><<<can you play steamvr through a usb c cabel with the pico 4 >>><<<can we order these from the uk in the us >>><<<wow great review i would like to know if the headset comes with a charge cable and how long it is can you play pcvr while it is charging can you browse your pc like using the headset as a monitor like you can with the oculus rift and rift s one more thing do you need to be signed in to a pico account to do pcvr through steam ty amp subscribed >>><<<the ui looks so similar to oculus >>><<<i wonder how the latency is with pc vr >>><<< >>><<<what is the city building game at 8 41 >>><<<if any of you are buying your first headset and have a good pc play half life alyx it is incredible >>><<<i thought pico 4 was not going to support pcvr as they wanted to focus on standalone and pico 3 link was there for pcvr>>><<<all good except the undetacheble headstrap i will wait untill 3d party accessories are released>>><<<odd that they chose an ipd range of 62 72 this seems to be in the higher range and would likely make it uncomfortable for those in the lower range surely it would have made more sense to make it  5 either side of the average ipd or maybe they did some research and found that people interested in vr would likely have a wider ipd for some reason >>><<<sick >>><<<the design of this looks good the weight of a headset is not as important as weight distribution and this looks like the load is split fairly evenly between back and front so will feel far more comfortable also same price as quest with pro strap included >>><<<use this device if you want all your personal data and telemetrics held by the fascist ccp in the prc>>><<<it is only 3dof and not 6dof so i guess it is not a worthy upgrade from my samsung oddysey >>><<<this is a very good review man well done>>><<<how is the image quality over usb compared to your pico neo 3 link >>><<<what can you say about new pancake lens used in pico 4 comparing to meta quest 2 >>><<<the reason i stop playing quest 2 is usually due to heat on my face does the pico run cooler >>><<<i know beat saber is exclusive to the quest but is there any game similar to beat saber on the pico also what is are the best games on it now in your opinion >>><<<great video but a quite important thing for me is that i wear glasses is there a chance of scratching the lenses or can you get prescription lenses like you can on the occulus >>><<<hi is it possible to browse internet or read e book is the text clear enough for long time reading working with documents >>><<<any system run by china is suspect will your data be compromised are you supporting their fascist dictatorship by buying it are profits being put into their military machine would you be concerned about manufacturing without proper environmental concerns what about the uighur genocide >>><<<ipd 62 to 72 not for me i have an ipd 59 5 >>><<<nice ive been looking to rid myself of zucherberg >>><<<what is the cost >>><<<wow i would love to review this one too looks really cool >>><<<this looks much more comfortable than the quest 3 wish it was available in the us>>><<<the headset literally looks like one straight from the ready player one movie >>><<<ah since the fov is almost 17percent more the extra resolution is more spread out than the q2 so probably look about the same as far as pixels seems movies would look similar so probably still sde like the q2 >>><<<how is the image compared to the q2 q2 movie quality still has some screen door >>><<<the market is not big enough to fragment with another app ecosystem market devs will make even less money and it could fail unless the market grows a lot >>><<<thanks for the video the price and features seem to be balanced quite well judging from the video pico is light years ahead of my ancient psvr so i guess i am due for an upgrade soon >>><<<what a good review i want to buy a new vr headset but i do not know if my gaming rig 3070 r7 5800x can handle without issues and good framerate the 4k resolution of the pico 4 i do not want to experience any motion sickness thats why im doubting between quest 2 a bit lower res or pico 4>>><<<can you confirm we can use pico 4 in pcvr mode with the usb c >>><<<hello i mainly play in the dcs world  i was thinking of buying hp reverb versus 2 but now in terms of parameters is pico 4 better than hp reverb v2 any advice or should i wait for meta and the apple >>><<<nooooooooooooo i have an ipd of 59 60  i was so looking forward to this too >>><<<how does this compare with the valve vr offering >>><<<looks interesting i am still on the quest 1 and i thought of buying the pico 4 pro so i get eye tracking but i will see if its worth it>>><<<i would never trust it you think facebook is bad for data all chinese companies are required by chinese law to share all data with the communist party you seriously want a device in your house with cameras microphones and contains all your personal account details that gives all that to the ccp f k that >>><<<no tv in your apartment  mmmm>>><<<the resolution is higher than the quest 2 then right are not they using a similar power chip so would the games perform worse then >>><<<finna be iphone v android>>><<<does the pico vr 4 include all vr games just as in quest 2 because i have a favorite game on quest 2 which is echo arena i just want someone to confirm if its still available for any vr headsets or its only exlcusive to the quest 2 >>><<<the best vr gaming is the hp reverb g2 >>><<<thanks for the review how is the image quality in games compared to hp reverb >>><<<tupacvr >>><<<damn this headset has copyright infringement on the quest 2 written all over it do not get me wrong it looks amazing but they took too many inspirations i would say it looks and feels like a quest 3 both in hardware and software >>><<<i know they are not selling in the us but is there any localization locks if i still get my hands on one >>><<<is it a pc vr >>><<<no display port is a deal breaker as i only use pcvr racing sims and msfs streaming that without massive compression and quality loss lol no way we are there yet>>><<<is this a significan not upgrade over the rift s i have had my rift s since 2019 and have been waiting for something that is better than the hp reverb g2 when it comes to image resolution >>><<<wish this came before the quest 2 would have got this instead love how small it is also what flying game was he playing in the video >>><<<very good video >>><<<great vid when will the headset be available to buy >>><<< 7 37 i like that the theater model looks a bit like a cross between an imax theater and the largest dolby cinema theater that i go to sometimes out here in arizona feels familiar in the best way >>><<<it is literally a slightly worse quest>>><<< 9 45 can you use the pico neo 4 with a usb 3 0 cable if so please let me know since i do not think the wifi in my room is solid enough to use the wireless streaming i have been trying to find an answer to this question for ages but have not been able to find it anywhere one thing i also would like to know is if the headset charges or maintains charge if you use it wired i would much appreciate it if you could give me the answers to these questions >>><<<do you need a pc for this >>><<<pico company are on top class >>><<<eh i get that it has a wider fov and a bit higher res but those controllers look so awful and in my opinion the q2 is the much better deal it is a shame it is backed by a company that does not have our best interest in mind >>><<<if this plays bonelab as seamless as it plays on the quest version on the quest 2 then it would be a consideration that is because if bonelab is seamless boneworks and other steamvr titles would be better than on quest 2 if it does not then i will stick with quest2 >>><<<what about people who wear glasses any information on that >>><<<very interesting video i am interested in buying a headset like this one as my first vr headset although what i cannot find is what pc specs do i need for a smooth experience i currently have a ryzen 7 2700 and a rtx 2060 with 32gb of ram is that enough to play pc vr games smoothly >>><<<i really do not see the point of vr>>><<<how do you get games on there same way as quest 2 via creditcard >>><<<one thing that is important to me that you did not mention can the headset be used indefinitely as a pcvr headset i had a friend is quest 2 over for a weekend and that still used up it is battery while i was flying in dcs world  giving me only about 4 hours before i would be forced by the hardware to take a break considering that some sessions with my wingman have been 10 or even 12 hours that is a big issue for me i currently have a rift cv1 but with the changes that they are pushing next year where you are forced to log in with a facebook account i am gonna have to switch to a different ecosystem >>><<<same cpu spec of quest 2 from 2020 is an auto no for me will wait for quest 3 next year >>><<<one question where the fuck is the headphone jack like seriously>>><<<can anyone tell me the average size of a game and how much is available i think that the 128gb version should be enough for me with games taking an average of 10gb that would be at least 10 games installed so that is probably more than enough i will probably use it more for pc streaming if i get one >>><<<these youtubers are more and more robotic by the day i absolutely can not stand these bot reviews>>><<<hi will it run usb c pen drives through the usb c port can it recognise files and movies when you plug one in >>><<<very excited about this headset it seems like the quest competition we were hoping for would love to get my hands on this some time maybe for a review myself awesome video man erg goed gedaan voor je eerste hardware video 3>>><<<i would love to get this headset from an official store and not a scalper once it is available >>><<<side heatstraps look uncomfortable to me seems if people have a wide head it wont be good>>><<<would love to know if capacitive touch shows up in steamvr is test controllers ui have not seen concrete evidence touch input will work with pc yet and it is a make or break for my usecases great video >>><<< was gifted it early take some of the personal opinions of it with a side of salt>>><<<little concerned about something does controllers have any kind of strap did not see them in video >>><<<could you somehow be able to play golf with this headset it is the game i want so would make my decision if i buy this one or the meta quest 2>>><<<looks nice only thing i would not like would be the strap and with the battery being in the back it does not look like you will be able to get third party straps >>><<<i just do not want to buy my games over again >>><<<i have a question  those controllers of pico neo 4 are touch controllers like quest 2 >>><<<why is this a oculus rip off ui and everything>>><<<as a diehard quest fan boy i gotta say this definitely looks impressive i hope it gets enough software to compete >>><<<can not wait for the usa release i was about to buy a quest 2 but this headset is more fitting for me>>><<<is sideloading possible what about sideloading beat saber from quest 2 will it work or does it depend on oculus api >>><<<so where the hell can i buy it in the us>>><<<watching you struggle with that arrow was painful you hold it on rhe end not the middle lmao >>><<<so pc vr works with cable >>><<<for something that comes from china this is actually extremely impressive>>><<<okay but how do you get your oculus game on your pico 4  >>><<<how is the microphone i would be interested in hearing a comparison between the quest 2 microphone and the pico 4 microphone>>><<<how about you call it what it is in the title a standalone headset there are many better vr headsets out there maybe this is the best standalone maybe it is not call it what it is>>><<<thinkin i might >>><<<competition is always great >>><<<if this had either beat saber or a displayport it would be a no brainer d >>><<<i am looking for my first ve headset do you think i should get the oculas quest 2 or the pico 4 i am leaning towards the pico 4 but just wanted another opinion>>><<<hi what is the resolution in steamvr at 100 percent and does 72hz feel ok much better on gpu>>><<<you said the pico 4 could be used via cable but everything else i heard says it can not or does it just not have proper dp and compression latency via usb is the similar to wireless >>><<<that passthrough camera option is clutch how could you not find that useful >>><<<yt recommends me your video as probably i am checking to make a pcvr for my new quest2 maybe i bought it too fast as a lot of vr helmet are coming but i could not wait and wow i must say you are really a beautiful young man did someone told you that you looks alike james marsden from the xmen movies have a nice day scott >>><<<looks ok but do not think the tech is a big enough of a jump for existing q2 owners to spend all that cash on >>><<<im so sick of my quest 2 i want this so bad lol>>><<<if my games are crossplay with thia new headset im definetly buying this one>>><<<bit more in depth specs coverage would have bin nice but thx anyway>>><<<same price as quest 2 and looks cheaper no thanks >>><<<to those worried about content devs and publishers are aware of the pico 4 and given that so much is the same between it and the quest 2 porting should be nearly painless if you want the pico headsets and future non meta headsets to get third party support all you have got to do is buy the headsets as they come out and business tends to follow it does not make financial sense to support a monopoly as a consumer of the hardware or platform for either players or creators we have been burned by monopoly pricing for ages and while the exclusives are not likely to be ported over officially unofficial or competing products will be made by creators who understand how profitable it can be to do so cheers >>><<<do you need a pico account to play in standalone pc mode >>><<<the menu looks like a knock off quest lol>>><<<out of being surveillance from facebook or tik tok i will stick with fb thanks do not care how good their head set is ill never trust tik tok>>><<<if we have virtual desktop for example for quest 2 will we need to buy it again >>><<<who cares about all these head sets where are the games other then half life alyx they are trash >>><<<nah i aint gonna listen to a sponsored review il wait for people who buy it like everyone else when its available>>><<<the pico also lets you browse the local network so if you have a windows file share on your computer you can connect to that and directly stream a 3d or normal movie to the headset over wifi i find this pretty handy just sit on the couch and browse to your file and play i have the pico 3 link but same software the built in video player is pretty capable which was a very pleasant surprise for me i am also going to have to try virtual desktop for this when it comes out >>><<<hi could you tell us how is controllers haptics please better than wmr with 2 aa power cell we should have strong haptic than oculus touch on quest 2>>><<<wait you can tethered it to pc via usb c is there any compression like in quest 2 >>><<< 9 17 wait you can use usb c just like quest  i am sold >>><<<so cool >>><<<wait how do you get hands in ms flight simulator >>><<<does it have bonelab >>><<<it looks cute on you>>><<<i am so lost right now i wanna get my first vr headset and seeing what pico offers it makes it look like it is the one i should get but the fact that quest 2 has more games more apps and everything more polished just makes me believe quest 2 it is better i do not know what to do hahaha i guess i will wait for more reviews on this new pico 4 headset thank you for this in depth review touching all points about the pico 4 i am looking forward to seeing more videos about this headset >>><<<how about the blurry ness amp screen door effects in environment amp movies >>><<<hell no who would actually get this get the meta quest 2 its cheaper plus no pc same graphics and better graphics card then the cheap ish pico this is literally a cheap knockoff of the index this is so light it feels cheap but its not cheap cuz of all of the tech no it has cheap plastic and cheap tech its just overpriced thats why its so light and i bet if you hit it or dropped it once its toast>>><<<this headset reminds me of the headset that wade watts uses in ready player one>>><<<is it possible to use deovr or skybox vr player for watching movies can you watch movies straight from your pc harddrive how long does the battery last is it enough to watch a whole movie >>><<<can you play beat saber in this vr >>><<<keep in mind this is only even remotely worth it for pcvr tbh there are very very few games available roughly 100 the quest store including app lab has over 1 000>>><<<this seems like it is gonna be a really good headset especially considering the face that the new quest is not gonna be a gaming headset and gonna be dollar1500>>><<<that full color camera is cool>>><<<can you get side quest without a pc like the quest >>><<<you show usb pcvr connection in the menu have you tried it out >>><<<is it possible to connect usb c to aux earphones >>><<<do it have any workout games>>><<<can not decline the ui is copying quest is>>><<<okay that is what we needed most neck movement without having a heavy xbox on our face>>><<<color passthru without xr  well it sux >>><<<so my biggest concern is you can not use wired headphones while playing pc vr with a cable since both would need to use the usbc port that is kinda a miss to me >>><<<can you use metaverse using this headset and also does it have netflix app >>><<< 9 17 they said this headset is wireless only which one is true >>><<<can not wait for it to come to the us>>><<<0 14 in the morning if my face is a little puffy i will put on an pico 4 while doing my stomach crunches i can do a thousand now >>><<<the uis and the headset it self look a lot like quest 2 >>><<<wow not bad at all i do wish however that there was a 120 hz oled pro version that was made with pcvr in mind with maybe improved in home streaming and full bandwidth cabled option would probably pay 550euros for such an option>>><<<comfort software  keys i have already seen good graphics  i am tired of seeing beat sabre and fishing games  when consoles dropped they dropped with legendary titles  they keep trying to sell vr headsets via shhhhty  games like bs  ironman etc >>><<<the only disadvantage i can think of is that when the battery degrades there is no custom headstrap capability like you said that is whta i love about the quest 2 the custom headstraps>>><<<re lack of an audio jack some people say to use bluetooth for audio however i have never seen a bluetooth headset that does not have significan not latency this will put the video and audio horribly out of sync this is why bluetooth headsets are not used for watching movies videos or gaming there are many videos on this subject so it is not an isolated issue even if a set of headphones can use aptx which is supposed to reduce latency does not mean that windows will choose to use the aptx codec with no way to tell windows which codec to use even the best headsets can be limited to lower end codecs which will mean significan not latency >>><<<when you start a game from steam does it use your pc to run the game or can you change it so the pico 4 runs it >>><<<aight impress me>>><<<thank you for great review i am new to vr and a month ago got my quest 2 impressed with some game quality like eleven pool tennis vr fishing but home screens all over nor sharp and youtube vr movies not impressed what about in pico viewing sharpness quality next month quest pro should be announced interesting to compare to pico and new year beginning apple >>><<<wish we could buy this in us soo gotta go with quest 2 i guess >>><<<very nice video as it is well structured and straight forward can not wait to see other videos about the pico 4 >>><<<why do companies still do aa and aaa batteries why not rechargeable p1sses me off>>><<<ccp owns this hardware and software >>><<<subbed looking forward to getting my paws on this >>><<<if you live with people and play vr often the full color pass through is super useful >>><<<great video thank you i do not know if anyone has asked this but i can not find the answer i know pico is not being officially sold in north america but if you know a guy in europe could you get a pico 4 sent over and would it work with steam vr or maybe standalone if you had a vpn etc  is it possible to connect with someone who will ship you a pico 4 from uk like on ebay or something >>><<<i think i will be buying one as a pcvr upgrade to my quest 2 but not fully sure yet like 90percent sure>>><<< 1 42 scott summers cosplay >>><<<is the black black enough or the black is just grey like quest 2 >>><<<it is perfect>>><<<this is the best headset for now before buying anything i would like to recommend waiting until next year or at least christmas sony is launching their psvr 2 meta their quest pro and next year quest 3 and apple is launching their headset also the next year the vr market is changing and im waiting until having all to make a choice>>><<<very nice video thank you >>><<<i would like to see a review all about usability if someone from the us imports it  any issues with doing so >>><<<just curious as to why pico would send someone with 4k subs a headset not a hater just genuinely curious >>><<<this very cool>>><<<how far up and how far down can your wrist move with those controllers do the tracking rings get in the way >>><<<i just got a oculus 2 now i want to get this cause like the one thing i do not like about the oculus is that it it hurts my neck cause like you said in the video it is heavy>>><<<wii i be able to buy this and ship it here to sacramento >>><<<great review >>><<<volume button on the arm was a poor design choice that is a moving part putting wear on the no doubt copper wire in the volume control it will in time fray and break>>><<<omg i need it badly >>><<<i still think that wireless headsets are too early in tech and needs time to improve while pcvr is still the best for gaming this is all my preference tho and people have always other opinions >>><<<hey nice video the pico looks great i just do not like that its owned by tiktok>>><<<honestly rather wait for the new quest the controllers look annoying to play with and is abt the same size as what the new quest looks like and quest might add more and better features and better graphics and comfort>>><<<can you show me microsoft flight simulator in action >>><<<do they have big screen and poker vr>>><<<with the added usb c to pcvr support this is near perfect hmd just missing a 3 5mm audio jack hopefully the pro version will have it >>><<<great video i have subscribed can you tell me is there a clear difference between image quality on the standalone games or watching films compared to the quest 2 such as screen door effect and can you tell a difference with fov thanks>>><<<have you tested this for vr pron >>><<<what about fov >>><<<hey just thought about the face cover and would not it have the same problem than the quest 2 default one like would not it absorb the sweat and all it looked like it would >>><<<great review it is disappointing that it does not have displayport i really can not stand compressed vr >>><<<no jack audio stupid crap >>><<<funny how earlier pico denied existence of wired connection thanks for the review >>><<<can not wait until this eventually hits the us looks fantastic >>><<<hello thank you for this extensive but short review i like videos like that short but with a lot of info i have one tiny question do you know if the buttons or sticks on the controller have a touch detection aka whether they are capacitive these kind of buttons and sticks detect if you just touch them but not press them down i run a community which is mostly about vrchat and i would love to recommend another headset than the quest or index the quest some people have concerns because of meta facebook the index is obviously quite expensive unfortunately only the oculus touch controllers and index controllers currently have this feature >>><<<my rift s died today and this pico 4 looks very interesting being exclusivly a pcvr 3070 r7 7700x user i have doubts tho i have never played games in streaming mode and even tho my internet is very nice 2500mb in down and 700mb in up in ethernet and about 150 down and 150 up in wifi my router doesnt support wifi6 i do not know if i am going to get a smooth experience please reply if you have some knowledge about that>>><<<wow this looks so nice am definitely buying this as soon as possible jumping from the original quest this should make a huge difference especially since i mostly play pcvr games >>><<< 4 27 but you can not play pcvr with cable pico said it is it not true it would awesome if i am mistaken>>><<<hbo max disney i have been waiting for that to show up on q2 wondering what is holding meta back from offering streaming apps on the store what is the resolution like inside these apps can you crank it up 4k >>><<<great review sir >>><<<this headset is incredibly impressive makes me wish it was available in the us as well haha >>><<<great review i am definitely very excited about this headset i am curious

hardware review video do not forget to check out my quest 2 vs pico 4 video for a nice comparison feel free to subscribe to keep notified it means a lot to me besides that i am very curious what you guys think of this headset please let me know you can preorder the pico 4 here uk  affiliate >>><<<so you do have fps vr in your library but did not use it for making this video wich would habe been rally nice to see what the gpu frame tiwe was and off course fps on screen >>><<<i am going to buy it>>><<<great content as usual on this channel i want to buy the pico 4 but i am just wondering if the library is good enough right now do you recommend it >>><<<why is the pico so laggy does it only work propperly with pcvr >>><<<got mine 2nd hand for 200 ukp in thailand it had been updated to 5 7 so none of the previous games worked anymore but now i have got it working with the latest firmware and its superb fun those 150 minutes of battery life fly by>>><<<when you turn off the headset does the controller also turn off >>><<<hold on you mentioned that the pico 4 only can play steam vr titles wireless but that thing got a usb c for power and video passthrough>>><<<so the bluetooth on pico 4 does not have a delay >>><<<this is the most british review i have ever seen >>><<<daim it i just got the headset as a upgrade to my old oculus cv1 and my cpu is to old>>><<<pico 4 youses like meta quest 2 display via link kabel usb c for steam vr lite update for your video>>><<<only 1 year warranty >>><<<herd pico games are waterdown game length compared to quest 2 >>><<<pico 4 vr or psvr2 >>><<<i bought the pico 4 but returned it because i experienced a little latency to the headset tracking especially noticeable when i was turning my head quickly or wiggling from side to side but definitely enough to create motion sickness something i never experienced in my quest 2 too bad as the image was definitely clearer did anyone else experience this >>><<<where do you get your anime wallpapers from >>><<<i may be tempted if it had skybox vr support by miles the best vr video player >>><<<can you create multiple accounts for multiple people so that it remembers theirs ipds like for me with 66 and for my son with 62 so we do not have to change it manually every time thanks >>><<<hi thanks so much for you vid i was looking into getting myself some vr goggles should i go for the pico 4 the meta quest 2 or should i wait the quest 2 is about 2 years old now perhaps it is a new one around the corner thanks >>><<<this is my humor>>><<<awesome i am glad you did a review on this vr headset because i own the quest 2 but i hate the fact that i have to use my facebook account in order to log in i like the fact that you do not need that with this headset>>><<<the pico 4 its a bad anti aliasing vr its so jagged compare with good old quest 2 quest 2 its way2 better the reviewer its to hype for pico 4 i think every reviewer>>><<<hi chris can you help me i just got a pico 4 i created an account with an email address on the vr assistant android app verified it all ok on the app then when i try to log in with that email on the pico4 headset it says this user does not exist any ideas >>><<<hello good morning i am interested in vr but sony is offer is too expensive i will go pico4 as i keep hearing out great it is >>><<<thanks >>><<<what was that boxing game you got there >>><<<i bought the pico 4 last week however i will not be getting my hands on it before the end of november my current vr headset is the htc vive but i rarely use it because i do not like the fornell lens and that also the main reason i bought the pico 4 instead of a quest 2 >>><<<fuggk facebook>>><<<will be opening a pico 4 next monday first time vr owners so very much looking forward to the first impression experience>>><<<think it a great looking headset but i wont be getting one as an apprentice printer the importance of color was drummed into me and also having something of an artistic bent i can not help viewing lcd screens as an offensive piece of penny pinching >>><<<can i connect it to my pc and play pc vr content on this like meta quest 2 >>><<<no resident evil 4 vr and no iron man vr which releases on quest 2 on thursday also no beat saber which is massive >>><<<i had the pico 4 then just got the meta quest pro meta quest pro is so much better>>><<<the lack of display port is an issue you need a high end pc and network infrastrutture to play pcvr games wireless >>><<<we got our pico 4 two weeks ago here in shanghai for the rather tasty price of gbp290 almost sent it back when i discovered that it is region locked to the chinese app store but being android and pretty open it was simple to get the global files and side load them glad we got this because i was really not up with giving meta my money plus i think this is the superior product >>><<< everyone who likes the name oculus quest 2 more than meta quest 2>>><<<i would be interested in how the pico 4 stands up to a virtual home office scenario i know immersed is coming to the pico 4 soon but no idea if there is another alternative to such things as vive sync or horizon workrooms for the pico platform did you try any productivity use cases for the headset does it operate while plugged in and charging can it tether over usb c display port to a pc like the quest 2 link cable or is it wireless only is the clarity of a desktop environment such as desktop readable at 1080p like resolution or higher is it comfortable enough to wear for extended periods 3 hour sessions does it get hot like the vive cosmos does it handle sunlight lit bright rooms ok i know the quest 2 used to freak out about it and the vive cosmos non elite just plain didnt work in bright rooms do the controllers provide any kind of pass through charging for the batteries >>><<<ts which is the best or cheapest sammy to get just for the emojis that look more poppy than my realme 7 5g one and with super power battery mode cheers>>><<<i think the lack of library compared to the meta quest 2 is a little unfair i have the quest 2 but only play games from steam on it and i do the same if i had this pico one i do not think there is enough of a benefit though to change the quest 2 right now i am interested to see what the quest pro brings to the table though hopefully the elite strap as standard as the standard quest 2 standard one is terrible>>><<<i have just got a meta quest 2 i assume there is not much difference tbh but what we all want to know is how does pronhub vr perform >>><<<i want this so bad it is perfect for me>>><<<wireless pcvr is where the pico shines the most i even do not understand who play those ps2 lookin standalone games >>><<< tech spurt did you update the os to 5 2 or you have apps that only reviewers with 5 2 os seem to have the disney prime etc i am stuck on 5 1 and do not have them  also mine draines battery faster than  was going to put a wife vibrator joke here but it is a family friendly show right d>>><<<i saw another review of this and it said that there is an adapter available to plug in headphones>>><<<looks like good value for the money >>><<<for pc gaming this or the meta cable support seems like a huge advantage regarding quality>>><<<i still will not get a wireless headset at this time they sound nice but i prefer my tethered vr headsets for the best pcvr and connected to my graphics card too many pre requirements to run the best speeds from wireless and still not as good as direct connections to the pc i mainly do sitting sim racing on my gaming pc i keep watching all the you tube videos on wireless and will wait till next year to see what is on the plate for updated or new wireless vr thanks for the video take care >>><<<are the images sharper and is the render resolution better than quest 2 >>><<<hello all time you give good product thank you>>><<<fresh>>><<<saw the thumbnail and wondered why uncle spurt had his pants on his head >>><<<nice>>><<<cool >>><<<yo>>><<<2 minutes ago gang>>><<<i have a pico 4 full moded with accus heatstrap and so on i testet the q3 and the q3 is so much better but not comortable at stok>>><<<just bought the pico 4 as it was on sale at a local online store less the price of a bnew quest 2 in fact it is a steal i only play pcvr mainly i actually also own and will keep my quest 2 as a back up>>><<<it is better at spying on you  >>><<<excellent review thank you >>><<<im only getting a vrheadset for vrchat only so i ask which is better pico 4 or quest 3 cause vrchat now supports pico 4 and i have been thinking but i can not decide due to my autism where im having a bit of trouble deciding things>>><<<i had a quest 2 and changed to the pico 4 a year ago and found it to be so much better i recently sold it and bought a quest 3 what a mistake i should never have got rid of my pico 4 luckily although has been expensive i now have a pico 4 again it is far better in every way down even the menu system and ui is far better the only downside is less games i also find it so much more comfortable and do not get any light bleed like you do it could possibly be your head shape i will not be changing again that is for sure >>><<<is it possible to use this vr gogle as a monitor for gaming on pc or ps4 >>><<<do you know if the pico 4 will work in the u s i have a friend in the uk who could ship me one from there but i want to make sure everything will work all right here >>><<<all the movies i see with pico 4 it looks like its lagging alot and quest 3 running smooth is pico running better now and with more mixed reality or are pico only good for pcvr >>><<<do you think i should buy the quest 2 or the pico4 i really do not know can not buy the quest3 btw >>><<<really well made review thank you>>><<<bought a pico 4 for my first vr headset for half the price of a brand new one around dollar500 aud instead of up to 1000dollar aud mainly being used for pcvr and steam games due to the high rez per eye display people still gota understand that you need a pretty beefy machine to even run 90htz or more for vr >>><<<i like more pico 4 over quest 3>>><<<do you have the global or chinese face interface >>><<<pico 4 is not quite as good as quest 2>>><<<i will gonna to buy pico 4 over quest 3 in half of the price because i am pcvr player there no big different between quest 3 and pico 4>>><<<just wait until pico 5>>><<<thanks for review i am choosing between q3 and p4 right now lt 3 i have questions that i may have missed in your review 1 whats with limited pc link bandwidth of p4 does it hurt much do you notice any lags or compression artifacts 2 i read p4 has noticeable ghosting effect ghost copy of bright object do you notice that alot does that hurt immersion >>><<<my pico 4 is being delivered tomorrow what game s should i download >>><<<hello i am a aspiring in this vr world i always apreciate the vr and ever want to experience this wonderful perhaps i am from a poor country and i have a poor salary so i never used or brought soon i saw this annoucement for quest 3 and i become a mad lol but watching this video i do not know what i will do what is do you recommends for me quest 3 this pico4 or i wait for pico5 other model again i do not know anything like hardware what is pancake lens or else i am just a tecnology apreciate what is you recommend for a first experience and the bestest vr sorry by the long text >>><<<after i learned that pico is owned by the parent company of tiktok i said to myself i much rather have americans have my data than the chinese >>><<<you sound like bruce from family guy >>><<<i do not see how you could use over the ear headphones with pico 4 since it covers the tops of your ears >>><<<pico 4 in my country nz goes for dollar699 a bare bones 128 gb quest 3 will cost dollar929 and 512 gb dollar1129 add in a elite strap and that is dollar1250 competing against a very similar pcvr experiance you can get for less than half that and pico 5 is only in april >>><<<hello harry is worth to buy pico 4 pro im now in china and there pico4 pro already in store but in torrents forums i can not find any guid to change location>>><<<does pico 4 censor stuff like words >>><<<i loved mine recently i have developed an awkward performance blurp the face foam is hard on the forehead the visuals are awesome tho i run it 250percent in steam vr i came from the q2 and previous to that the rift s rift and dk2 never had a single issue with tracking i spend most of my time in dcs >>><<<there are too few games in pico unless you play steamvr>>><<<i purchased pico 4 to replace quest 2 after it lunched mainly due to massive youtube hypetrain and i was pretty dissapointed everything felt so beta compared to q2 my main problem was lack of any good pcvr connection at the time resulting in worse image than airlink so it was actually a downgrade and i got rid of it i also had a lot of pupil swim but i can see it even in q pro so maybe my eyes do not like pancakes i think pico missed a big oportunity releasing it unpolished the price is great the specs are great the passthrough was vomit inducing though >>><<<purchased mine 6 days ago and was initially impressed but as time went on i realised there was an issue no matter what adjustment i did to the ipd i could not get a clear focus also i was getting a slight heat haze shimmering effect on the visuals small text was sort of shimmering although when i angled my head over to right or left shoulder it corrected the issue bit of a shame but i returned them as defective due to watching many youtube vids with the pico 4 showing none of these issues reddit has many comments on these visual aberrations on the pico 4 many were saying it is down to known manufacturing issues on sets made in certain batches during 2021 and 2022 shame i was looking forward to using it but i think i will wait another year or so and see how the vr ar industry progresses i will watch your channel to see how advancements in the more budget range progress >>><<<if pico sold in the usa i would buy it but they do not threfore meta quest 3>>><<<leaks have the pico 5 releasing next year with better resolution than the quest 3 i will wait for more pico 5 announcements >>><<<if q3 had eye tacking they would monopolize the market immeditely one major problem with commercial vr is that you can not see anything outsite the center of the screen like pico 4 if use as a desktop vr browse internet i cannot read anything if do not move my head to center what i want to read >>><<<i think the q3 will be similar to the p4 for visuals and if one display the p4 would be better as far as visuals for gaming q3 is obviously going to be better with the faster soc >>><<<how can you compare an unreleased product to something that is actually available>>><<<i mainly want to use pcvr so should i go for pico 4 or wait for quest 3 >>><<<have had my p4 for a few days now visuals look better than the q2 and qp since way less screen door good set for movies and media added the huge 3 1gb update made a big difference better color and contrast to go along with the panel resolution the video player has an enhanced video setting that makes it look great and i am a picky sob >>><<<i am using my pico4 mainly for pcvr and my quest2 for fitness yesterday i played skyrim vr with my quest2 instead of the pico4 i was curious if all updates of the quest2 made any change faster processing and gpu and after that with my pico4 well  pico4 was a big winner once again if you only play pcvr there is no doubt about it pico4 but i will buy the quest3 since it will have similar lenses and a much better chip to me the quest3 will be a pico4 and quest2 melted together and will have the benefits of both headsets i also heard the rumour that there is a pico5 coming to the market  i am curious >>><<<if the quest 3 just had 4k microoleds per eye it would be the best headset for the next 5 years >>><<<disappointing these companies can not include dollar2 displayport over usb c connection they probably do it on purpose so people are more inclined to use the in headset store if have they money get bigscreen beyond >>><<<need to know if the q3 has one or two displays if one a lot less resolution than the p4 making two displays eats a lot of horizontal resolution and is not accounted for in the specs same for q2 >>><<<i personally going for meta headsets meta has a way better library and better support overall meta has more experience in vr technology and has a better future in vr industry i am definitely going for quest 3 >>><<<lol not even close i think they are releasing a pico 5 tho >>><<<i would like good quality pcvr but at a budget around dollar500 i must choose between having display port or pancake lenses which would you choose i have heard pancake looks great but i do not know if that will be offset by the compression of usb vs dp >>><<<i am just waiting for a company to have that light bulb moment realizing that the real potential in these headsets has everything to do with evolving inside the desktop computing space >>><<<im sure its a great headset but the fact that all the games ive bought are link to my quest account it only makes sense to stay with meta now if the pico 5 comes and they offer titles that will not be found any where else that are big tripple a games then that would probably make me migrate if its a better headset and if it has a ton of games>>><<<pimax crystal is worht the money or should i buy pico 4 the crystal is so much better than pico 4 what do you think >>><<<thanks for the review very insightful >>><<<that would suck if you punched the guard rail for your staircase  it would probably shatter however i punch my tv all the time and it still works fine though >>><<<well that is really crappy kids they should give it out for free>>><<<literally ps1 ps2 gaming graphics  waste of money >>><<<liessss>>><<<meta quest 2 better>>><<<i purchased a local chinese copy and want to use it in africa is it possible that i will encounter problems while downloading games and updating the system >>><<<can you put a sd card into the pico 4 >>><<<wow >>><<<>>><<<do u still need to use fb >>><<<i heared those vents are for ventilating your eyes and the lenses to prevent fog building up >>><<<it is comfort with glasses user >>><<<ay im getting mine in 2 weeks>>><<<i think i have the chinese version excellent hardware sharp good tracking great sound you did not even mention the hand tracking which is in beta through my wifi 6e router it plays steam vr games fine including msfs but there is a slight lag that makes beat saber less enjoyable even via virtual desktop but my chinese pico 4 comes with a beat saber rip off which is actually much better and visually more attractive it is called mutrix absolutely love it except the fact that the game requires the user to login via the internet not very stand alone if you ask me >>><<<5thank u so much for review thats help me a lot>>><<<can you try something serious like rise of the tomb raider or hitman 3 not child games with graphics from 1999 can you confirm the refresh rate with and without cable also the movies can they be viewed on real full screen or from a closer diatance >>><<<it is a pity that they removed displayport>>><<<cheap copy of the quest 2>>><<<question can one buy this but not let tiktok collect your information seeing its owned by bydance ccp spy company can it be used off there grid with there spy collections softer ware >>><<<do u have to pay for all those games >>><<<3d sbs quest 2 vs pico is there any difference i bought quest only for sbs 3d movies and i am not liking the screen door effect and washed out colors >>><<<plco4vr>>><<<what about vr 180 or 360 videos in youtube will it play those videos >>><<<pico 4 is better in every aspect expect refresh rate yet most influencers beat around the bush saying they are different it is like saying ford fiesta and tesla and different yes they are different but one is clearly more powerful >>><<<can u plug in headphones >>><<<does it have a similar big screen like the quest so i can transfer films from my laptop to the pico 4>>><<<recently bought one and i do not feel any discomfort i have fun playing with the free apps i also use it for my fitness >>><<<i would buy one but the games look really lame>>><<<all i wanna know is does the porn look better on pico than on quest >>><<<is in pico can plat walking in the plank >>><<<really nice video dude i think beat saber and bartender vr had to be the absolute best i was well impressed with your bartending skills >>><<<can u sideload re 4 vr >>><<<looks amazing i will buy this >>><<<i do not know what you are talking about tbh for me the pico 4 is rly uncomfy after like 30 mins because of the pressure and how hard this foam stuff is and no i didnt just set it too tight>>><<<how does the recline mode works does it allow me to play vr while laying down in bed >>><<<just ordered a pico 4 from amazon>>><<<is there an online pvp feature >>><<<does the game you show all free in store >>><<<how long does it take to load the battery i will use it for simracing and we do some 24 hour races so i can do some one or two hour breaks wonder if that is enough>>><<<can you play contractors on the beast>>><<<can the pico 4 be a pc vr >>><<<but should i buy the pico 4 or meta quest pro>>><<<can you play steam vr games >>><<<great video very reassuring for a first time vr user i recently got my pico 4 on a black friday sale however the fact that you do not even mention any downside like the bad performance and extra lag when using the official streaming assistant or the for the moment inferior ports of mq2 games lower resolution not up to the latest versions and missing dlcs  make it feel like a slightly biased review sometimes it is okay to mention the good and the bad and still come up with a overwhelmingly positive impression and an honest one >>><<<how did you get the cast to mobile to work it does not seem to work on my samsung fold 4 my pico 4 just does not detect my phone >>><<<great review just purchased one from argos looking forward to it first vr experience my kids are going to go wild >>><<<play vr chat in pico 4 plsss>>><<<is it doable to lay down in bed with the battery in the back also do you know if can send videos from the phone to the headset >>><<<i sold my quest 2 a long time ago due to it having a really limiting small fov and uncomfortable controllers and it was not super comfortable on the head it was fine but nothing like the pico 4 so hopefully the pico 4 would be a better vr experience which i would like and be happy with so far seems like most people say that pico 4 is better than quest 2 and so i am convinced it is worth buying coming from my old quest 1 which i still use >>><<<these vendors shopuld tone down with this marketing bs per eye i take my old cardboard vr and put my old 2015 16 xperia z5 inside of it then what i have 3860x2160p for each eye this bs with each eye is some marketing bs trying to confuse consumers each eye you need individuel screens for each eye quest 2 is like the old cardboard vr where you used your mobile as single screen quest 2 got 1 single big screen at 5 46 with a resolution at 1832x1920 and it got 3 5 mio pixels and it got a pixels pr sq inch at 487 ppi pico4 got 2 individuel screens for each eye and extremely small at 2 56 with 2160x2160 and the headset got 9 33mio pixels 2x2160x2160 and 1193 ppi its not even close pico4 got 270percent more pixels and the pixels are 250percent smaller with 1193 ppi vs 487 ppi but that aint sunshine and roses as they have more or less the same soc with an added 2gb for pico4 8gb vs 6gb on q2 and its taxing to run so many pixels 9 33 mio vs 3 5 mio so do not expect the same fps as fx q2 or neo3 that also had only 3 5 mio pixels btw the pico4 also charges faster then the rating with the ncl fastcharger its 9v at 2a so around 18watt but with fx a power bank with the appropriate fast charge protocol its a tad over 25watt 9v at 2 5a >>><<<so stuck between this and the quest 2 for my first headset the only thing putting me off the pico 4 is the game library but the specs on this are a lot better and surely any tracking issue or various teething problems will be fixed with software updates and i imagine the game store will keep being updated any recommendations or suggestions >>><<<no skyrim vr bruh>>><<<lol pico 4 is just a crappy mess do not believe these paid youtubers amd stick with your quest 2 i have earnt it at my own costs >>><<<did not understand why it never got a us release it is definitely a missed opportunity to compete with oculus maybe they might change their mind in the future >>><<<omg imagine if he was naked and pump squatting to that music>>><<<blimey are you an employee of pico >>><<<blimey are you an employee of pico >>><<<stuttering and jittering on tracking headset and controllers did you notice that issue >>><<<you can also watch youtube vr 360 videos>>><<<wow i already ordered it on aliexpress>>><<<wow i have an original vr headset havent used it in two years might have to get this>>><<<triple a batteries or double >>><<<thanks for your reviews can it be connected to the ps5 or other consoles does it work well as an android tv  i saw your review of goovis lite s if it is to recreate a screen which one do you prefer i am looking at which one to buy i appreciate you helping me in the decision thank you very much>>><<<is the pico 4 coming to the us because when i look it up it saids that there is no plans to release the pick 4 to the us >>><<<very well explained and presented i had the oculus 2 last year but could not get used to the lens blurring pico 4 now defiantly on my xmas list >>><<<uhhhh yeah of course its going to be better its newer tech duh how about we compare it to its actual challenger the quest pro or the quest 3 when it comes out >>><<<the pico 4 is xr2 is overclocked so i do not think that they share the same max frequency >>><<<does anyone know how much these pico games cost and whether they can be tested before buying i am only interested in non violent games >>><<<can you play tales of glory in the pico 4 >>><<<nice review do one for the quest and quest pro>>><<<can you make a video on how to mirror the screen to tv and mobile >>><<<on two minds it looks a look like the nintendo wii in vr >>><<<got my pico 4 glasses yesterday and just tested without facemask and eyes as close as possible the difference is huge then if you lift little from the strap going over your head to get the weight of your nose  that made me think somebody should make similar type facemask for p4 than quest pro has that forehead cushion piece and maybe those little pieces on the sides to block light voila that would make the fov and experience million times bigger and better  have you tested that this would be a huge improvement >>><<<nice review chiqz >>><<<technically its better but the software has a long way to go plus people apparently are now concerned about their privacy and security when dealing with a bytedance company bit late for that after giving all their lifes data to google fb meta ms etc  pretty sure they can almost double their battery life if they spend some time on those power profiles the thing basically runs at full pelt all the time you can tell  ps not trying to be rude but perhaps in future try to not shake head and hands so much as it makes it hard to look at what your showing from a viewer perspective i have seen other vr yt achieve stable demoing at least in the menus and apps etc obvious bit hard to do that in games >>><<<best review of pico 4 so far good job bro >>><<<plays a bunch ow games does not include halflife alyx or boneworks>>><<<if i was buying a headset for the first time i would probably get the pico 4 but considering i already own a quest 2 really the only thing i would get a different headset for is maybe the pancake lenses i do not really need to upgrade at all until the quest 2 starts to become like old old gen>>><<<it looks fantastic >>><<<can you please review the new formuler z11 pro max >>><<<that latency on beat saber though should definitely use virtual desktop for now for pcvr streaming for way better performances at least until they improve the steaming assistant>>><<<this has been the best pico 4 video i have seen so far i have mine already and enjoying it a lot and i agree the upgrade coming from the quest 2 is actually huge screen clarity and comfort is on another level did you actually buy all that games >>><<<the boundary is driving me crazy in this video>>><<<what i like is the capacity to watch movies and tv shows >>><<<i can only get the pico 4 or the psvr 2 the wait to hear more and price of the psvr2 is killing me >>><<<cool video i have the quest2 and will keep it but i bought the pico4 as well getting it next week >>><<<this is very tempting but i already have invested in the quest eco system can not switch now >>><<<can you play mod maps on contractors with pico without pcvr>>><<<i like the pico 4 quite a lot and use it almost every day although i have to admit that the image is not that stable compared to the quest 2 it just feels a little bit jittery and there is a tiny and strange fisheye effect visible if you play pcvr this becomes very apparent in my opinion so you can see the world warping around you depending on what is on screen i got used to it but it is just not as good as on the quest 2 >>><<<great video this looks great >>><<<it is no surprise pico 4 is sold out everywhere it is amazing >>><<<that is one bold statement lol a device is nothing without software support so as good as the pico 4 is the quest 2 is still better because it has better software support like why the raspberry pi is still the best sbc even though its not as fast as others >>><<<it will forever be oculus not meta >>><<<you forgot the biggest reason for the pros column of the pico it is not associated with facebook  d>>><<<awesome walk though mate and i could not agree more i think the pico 4 is amazing>>><<<waht about pcvr >>><<<if they had added a micro sd slot this would be an immediate purchase >>><<<hi chigz tech reviews i have tested now my pico 4 with steam vr games but i have already problems with some games new retro arcade neon doom vfr the problem is that always the htc vive controllers are shown which prevents the me from being able to control anything from time to time it happened that when starting new retro arcade neon the quest 2 controllers where shown and i was able to use the game but still  pressing one button on the pico 4 controller lead to pressing 2 arcade machine buttons in the settings always the oculus touch controllers are chosen which should be the best fit since there are non pico 4 or quest 2 controllers available how can i solve this problem or how do i know that a game works for my pico before i buy it in elite dangerous no controllers are shown at all and i can not do anything beside looking around how do you controll this game i would be really pleased if you could help me with this issue or maybe make a video about this issues since for sure more people will have this problem thanks in advance >>><<<great video but i am sticking with the quest 2 to release this without some cool brand new exclusive game s for it was a missed opportunity >>><<<quest 2 still the best>>><<<any cricket or baseball game on pico >>><<<when i do screencasting a permanent message pops up on my pico saying screencasting do you have this happen and if so is there a way to remove it >>><<<no head tracking issues or wraping effect >>><<<been on the fence about a vr headset for a while now but i think i may just have to pull the trigger on this one excellent review as always >>><<<another pico 4 vid>>><<<yeah but you can not pirate every oculus game like you can with the quest lol>>><<<cpu on the pico 4 is clocked higher and have ufs 3 0 faster storage also it is vented inside to prevent fogging >>><<<is bonelab on pico 4 store >>><<<does pico 4 still has visible pixel dots

of pico 4 i have seen so far thanks bro  >>><<<did not know they put the price up on meta quest 2 for sure vr is future thanks chigz>>><<<my meta quest 2 do not need it>>><<<when you post this quest 2

are other stand alone headsets this is just a bad marketing tactic also you can get a quest 2 for dollar240 now that the 3 is out it originally costed around dollar400 so i would not really say that the quest is expensive it depends on which one you get edit i looked it up and some pico vrs will cost over dollar400 so the pico is not better just because of the price i am mentioning this because

has four cameras around its surroundings its light as the quest 3 and it has one camera at the center plus the quest three has more cameras i suppose so like around 6 at the front maybe and four around looking while the controllers have cameras on them so you would not have to use the quest two controllers or the pico but overall it can be the quest pro or the quest 3 to be better than pico is headset and controllers and it also depends on what it has like more storage or more battery life >>><<<meta is butter>>><<<i still think pcvr is a little better>>><<<why is youtube showing this after apple vision released>>><<< mrwhosetheboss i am not a hater but oculus had it first>>><<<oculus i am standing right here>>><<<quest 2 and 3 alright pal step aside time for the real
