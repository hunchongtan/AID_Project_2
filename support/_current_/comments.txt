<<<You need to be online with it? that&#39;s one way of them accessing information like face scans to be sent back to China for evaluation. I have lack of trust when electronics ask to be on-line &amp; ask for more personal details before you can use it!>>><<<They are locking up these devices to their stores, games, controllers. VR should be open platform, so you can buy controllers (including specialty gun like) for any device, you should also be able to play steam vr games regardless of your vr headset, if they don&#39;t standardize these things VR is not going to be popular (at leas nowhere near as popular as regular consoles).>>><<<The middle fingers 😂 that’s the real test>>><<<Didn&#39;t Apple copy these guys?>>><<<Who also checked his Steam inbox @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=439">7:19</a>? 😅>>><<<Hi  this head set have some sort of lag in games in wireless mode?  I buyed reverb g2 and sell it a few months ago because the lenses become blurry after minutes of use.>>><<<Highly reluctant to give facebook my hard earned cash. Made my mind up. Pico 4 it is. Great review mate.>>><<<What about the Quest 3? The Quest 3 has full colour past-through and no fish eye, small controllers so you don’t clash them together and the headset is so much smaller so it is so much more portable to take around!>>><<<So let me do the math here regarding the controllers. After a quick google search, you can see that a double A battery has a capacity of 1800 to 2700mah at 1.5V. Let&#39;s be realistic and land on a 2400mah battery for a very decent one.<br>An economical 18650 lithium ion battery that has a great capacity is the Samsung 35E or something. 3500mah at 3.6V.<br>So 1.5*2400= 3.6Wh<br>3.6*3500=12.6Wh<br><br>So... Say you are a dedicated gamer. You play VR games for more than 10 hours per week. Every week you will have to pay about 4$ for batteries. At the end of the first year will have paid more than 200$, maybe even 250$ for batteries :D <br><br>How much is a Samsung 35E? <br>3$ :) (6$ for two controllers)<br><br>So why don&#39;t they put 18650s in there??? Weight? No... 2*AA batteries is 46grams. 1*18650 is 48grams xD<br><br>Charging controller and type C port? Literally 1$ or less manufacturing cost... <br>So why? Environmental concerns? Surely after 200 batteries thrown in your trash per year, this is not realistic... <br>So?... <br><br><br><br>I rest my case, they&#39;re just stupid... They don&#39;t get that 4*AA batteries for the two controllers is a considerable expense if they are used frequently...>>><<<Good evening.Awesome,thank you very much.Extremly healthy,forever young,very beautiful,the best of luck,a lot of money,gold,diamonds,prosperity,wealthy,abundance,harmony, happiness and success in your life!🍀🏆💓 *>>><<<Reasons why to not get the pico 4<br><br>You CANT Play Gorilla Tag on it<br><br>Theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap<br><br>Pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100$ while pico costs 430$<br><br>And its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can’t do anything about it>>><<<hi ! i am planning to buy this one, I would like to ask how harmful it is for the eyes and neck?>>><<<Thank you, my friend, for the detailed explanation, but you forgot to talk about screen resolution when watching movies.>>><<<bruh this is like meta stealing picos style>>><<<does the pico 4 pro have eye and face tracking? im unsure on this>>><<<so the quest 3 but objectivally worse>>><<<Is it compatible with ps5?>>><<<Quest 2 + Quest 3 + Quest Pro = Pico 4>>><<<I’m looking at getting one but need to know what it’s like if you wear glasses ?

On The Pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher (via link cable) Could see thousands of black dots in game around 3-4 meters away. The mic either picked up everything or nothing at all (VRC) Also I could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges. And the controllers weren&#39;t as comfy to hold, my middle fingers didn&#39;t line up with the side trigger.

Can one buy this but NOT let tiktok collect your information seeing its owned by bydance CCP spy company? Can it be used off there grid with there spy collections softer ware?>>><<<and that&#39;s what i call a beautiful design>>><<<Thanks for the review Ten Hag. GGMU!>>><<<Advanced Beat Saber players beware! Considering the Pico4 for playing everything Expert+ on Beat Saber? TLDR: Forget it!<br><br>Long version:<br>- If you use the Pico Streaming assistant either over Wifi or over USBC, and you crank up the video settings to the max, the image quality is still inferior to a Valve Index because it&#39;s blurry. Lower the settings and it becomes more blurry. No matter how, it&#39;s blurry despite the pancake lenses. Personally I prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect (as on the Index), than a blurry image without. Some say the Pico streamer app is compressing the video too much. Who knows. Whatever the limitation is, it sucks.<br>- So if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you&#39;ll need to use Virtual Desktop. Virtual Desktop consists of 2 parts: an app on the Pico and a streamer app on your PC. But, there&#39;s a but. Virtual Desktop&#39;s streamer app wants to go over Wifi only. There used to be workarounds involving &quot;tethering over USB&quot; but after the last firmware update they don&#39;t work anymore. The workaround involved installing an Android app (APK) which allowed you to access all of the Pico&#39;s hidden settings. Besides, it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up, tons of forums to read on Reddit, hard to get right on the first try, and you had to enable the settings on the Pico and on your PC every time before playing. Uggh! <br>If with your previous headset you used to just &quot;start VR&quot; and play, this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker.<br><br>- But now for <i>the</i> major deal breaker: The controllers!!<br>OMG these controllers are SO bad for playing Beat Saber! It&#39;s worse if you have big hands. Their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and <i>secure</i> grip. You end up clicking buttons all the time while playing (and you know what that does). The plastic is super slippery. When playing fast they <i>will</i> slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed. Don&#39;t even think of playing any Camellia map. When you see youtubers play Beat Saber with them they all play very slowly. Clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming. The tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play: it &quot;works&quot; but it&#39;ll ruin your PP.<br><br>For the rest, I found the face mask to be very uncomfortable (compared to a Valve Index), but I guess YMMV and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and don&#39;t let light in from the sides.<br><br>I returned my Pico4 after less than a week of daily use.<br>The poor image quality due to the streaming limitations, and the slippery un-ergonomic inaccurate controllers, made me do so.>>><<<What games can you not play on the Pico that you can on the quest>>><<<Its like meta quest pro>>><<<Pico 4 is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PSvr just for that middle finger>>><<<So its a quest 2 but worse.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=867">14:27</a> Interesting.

But since the release leaves out the US, which is a big market for VR. I&#39;ve had people tell me that they will import it. but Pico said if you try to access their Pico home and store on the headset, it won&#39;t work. so unfortunately I can&#39;t see it as an alternative to any quest products.>>><<<I&#39;ll wait for the Quest 3!

Maybe they will port it over soon.>>><<<I own an Oculus Rift. While quest 2 seemed interesting, trying the headset I found it to be way heavy and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m all sold on it. Pico seems like a a good option (mostly because I only play pc VR,) but I&#39;m unsure if I should invest in it. Is it worth upgrading from Oculus Rift to a Pico?<br>Also I wish more VR makers could make controllers like Valve index.>>><<<should you upgrade from quest 2 to pico 4?>>><<<So it does have capacitive sensors inside the controllers. Never seen that mentioned in other reviews.👍>>><<<Will it ever come to the states?>>><<<I have a question will this VR headset be good for bone works or any games like that like example half life Alex>>><<<It’s October 22 and I’m pretty sure like it’s already sold out>>><<<shame they gave up on the displayport, that wouldve really set it apart from the quest 2 but i guess the extra production cost versus the amount of people you have access to a powerful enough pc was just not worth it in their eyes... i guess current gpus are now powerful enough where the compression isnt that noticeable unlike back in 2016 when it was necessary considering the 1060 being what was available at the time>>><<<I feel like I wasted my money on the oculus quest 2 :((>>><<<I wan´t to get a vr headset should i get a quest 2 or the pico 4?>>><<<If you could please not jam the headphone plug into that USB port that would be wonderful thanks!!!>>><<<Am buying both for the hell of it>>><<<Owned by tiktok, I&#39;m immediately out.

Plus I miss out on being able to play re4vr and other quest exclusives.>>><<<Good deal if you want china harvesting all ur data>>><<<fuck the CCP and anything that they use to steal our data.>>><<<Just received my Pico 4 and it is night and day difference for me from Quest 2. However, I can totally understand why some people may not feel as big a difference. For me, the &quot;sweet spot&quot; area in Quest 2&#39;s lenses is so small that it&#39;s almost unusable. I actually ended up digging out my Rift S again. Pico 4&#39;s &quot;sweet spot&quot; is vastly bigger. It&#39;s still not the entire field of view but not nearly as disruptive as in Quest 2. Therefore, if you have also suffered from the tiny center clear area of Quest 2, you will find Pico 4 being miles better. But if you haven&#39;t had any problem with Quest 2 in the first place, you might not be as blown away.>>><<<I still don&#39;t understand why they thought it was a good idea to region lock them 😔 like at least give the option to unlock it when buying one from china>>><<<Giving my info to CCP VS Lizardman. I&#39;d choose CCP.>>><<<I don&#39;t want to own either headset from Facebook or China. Both are just Spyware peices of junk. Of course saying all that people will just consider a conspiracy theorists or something.>>><<<I need your opion on this, I currently have a Quest 1 for PCVR and I am going to get a new headset. Should I just stick with a Quest 2 because I already have some standalone games on it or should I look at getting a Pico 4? I need to know by the end of the month so anyone give me some advice please?>>><<<I really like the look of the Pico 4. But I just don&#39;t want to buy all of my games/software again. If only there was some kind of cross platform option.>>><<<Awesome detailed review as always. I was waiting to see details of the Pico 4 pro. Trying to decide if and when to upgrade from quest 2. With it only for enterprise outside China the Pico 4 is an appealing option. May wait and see what happens with the software updates and Pico store. <br><br>Great to see more options coming, including PSVR2. Competition is great,  but it does make it hard to know where to spend my $$. Also, caution with committing too much to one platform. <br><br>Excited to see what comes from sidequests backing from Google. This has the potential to make switching platforms easier and not losing your library. Could Google play become the VR game store of choice?>>><<<Im actually thinking of switching my quest 2 for my pcvr use>>><<<QUEST 2 FOREVER BOIZ!>>><<<Nice review. I ordered my pico 4 set today, and it&#39;s expected delivered on Wednesday. I live in Norway, and seems no delivery problems here. At least not what I heard.>>><<<this headset is literal garbage right now though because of its game library, there is literally no reason to buy something that doesnt have any good games to play>>><<<would never support tik tok. (binance)  They are part of this county going to shambles. so therefore I would rather have the quest 2>>><<<When I save up I’m buying to upgrade from my quest 1>>><<<I just want that shiny box it comes in.>>><<<If these come to the US I would consider one to replace my Rift S.>>><<<Thank you>>><<<tea?

You are the 1st video I came upon in looking for a headset.. So the other day I went and bought a Quest 2 and the head and face thingy&#39;s you use on yours...I&#39;ve also gotten very interested in games by watching your videos...Thank you for all the great information on all these amazing products...

For some products to be successful like game consoles and VR headsets, you need as much of them possible in the hands of actual consumers. Example... the new Pico 4 VR headset. To have developers create content for it, it has to be in the hands of as many people as possible. With every single one scalped the sh.t out of, there is not a single one on the market. Eventhough the original price of a 256 gig version is 500 bucks, Amazon&#39;s scalp devision sells them at 900 bucks and are already sold out permanently. Making the future of it as bleak as the PS5. In one generation of scalping game consoles are dead. VR will go the same way. In the end we will have nothing left. We are witnessing the end of popular consumer products. The only way to stop this is sell one per verified person at the normal retail price. Companies are to shortsighted to see how just selling everything to scalpers will kill their own products in the future. It&#39;s sickening. I really wanted to buy a PS5 but gave up on that years ago. I&#39;m not paying a scalper anything. I hope they get stuck with tons of unsold sh.t and die in a fire. Nobody should pay these a.....les a single penny. I will probably never get my hands on a Pico 4 VR either, and have to exept my dated Quest 2 will be the last standalone VR I will ever own. And with no playerbase, any software sales depended products are dead on arrival. The solution is simple and starts at the companies that manufacture them. STOP SELLING IN BULK TO NON CONSUMERS FFS!!!!>>><<<Having aspherical lenses is a HUGE plus IMO. It should greatly improve the sweet spot. In addition, the fresnel  type lenses always seem to give me a headache. They cause tons of visible distortion. I hope we see more headsets going to smooth glass lenses.>>><<<I don&#39;t like because controller using AA battery , I want rechargeable battery like the controller of Sony and Xbox>>><<<I&#39;m looking for a device which has a better resolution and FoV than Q2 to play DCS without breaking my bank account - This may be the one.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=76">1:16</a> &quot;LCD Displays&quot; ist saying display twice.>>><<<The only question I have is why on earth would you use a grenade to open a door, and then waste another one on a single zombie?

Thank you!>>><<<Same company as TikTok, gross. <br>get this trash our of here from a trash company>>><<<Beat Saber isn´t on it so hard pass>>><<<<b>These chinese dudes are so OP.....</b>>>><<<I&#39;m going nowhere near this just for the fact that this company has already been caught access american user data, I don&#39;t want to give the Chinese Government access to inside my house.

Very good review!>>><<<I got my Pico 4 about 48 hours ago and yesterday there were many more games than day before in the store, so the content issue might be outdated soon and I love it. Very comfortable for my head and the PCVR streaming is awesome (RTX 3080 with 1000 Mbit router). So much better than my f-ing Vive Cosmos with a cable. Just not great for sim-racing, since those games in VR brings down every system without 4090 to it&#39;s knees already without streaming, but it was playable and the input lag probably similar or even less than with v-sync on a pancake. But no problem with HL Alyx and finally a great experience in this game.>>><<<ITS NICE TO COMPARE QUEST 2 (release 13.10.2020) vs PICO 4 (release 15.10.2022) and say that its almost the same parameters XD>>><<<I have the pico myself and just wanted to say I think the tracking isnt great with movement. I noticed when I opened the pico menu or library the screen is slightly moving and doesnt feel as stable as on the quest 2. Lets hope it wil get fixed in some update but its really weird noone has noticed this.>>><<<I believe that Pico is on the right track,just ironing out the bumps,but with a little help from the community and devs,i think that this will be a vr headset that will push the boundaries of vr. Call me dumb,but i see a bright future for them. Well done to Pico &amp; great video mate 👊🏼.. just sad,that im broke,i would loved to used this Pico 4... 😓..>>><<<Power adapter? How mich W?>>><<<FReality not the same anymore. Hope you return in the near future>>><<<Must be nice to be able to afford an oculus, anyway love the content keep it up bro>>><<<I don&#39;t trust chinese companiese or companiese related to chinese fund so I won&#39;t buy this, however competition is good thing for consumers whatsoever. Nice review as always!>>><<<Hey There,<br>i mainly would play Steam VR Games and only had a Quest 2 for a month some time.<br>Would you recommend the Pico 4 for me? Or would you recommend me to wait for a 4 Pro?>>><<<If you were to use VR with link cable to PC (so you can run wired steam games) woun&#39;t the audio come out of your PC? Does this mean you can use wireless 2.4 Headphones with dongle (example Steelseries 7 or higher) to have much lower latency?>>><<<basically a pancake quest ! (in more ways than one) flater overall headset and flat lenses>>><<<After all that shady stuff byte-dance did also with the upcoming eye tracking don’t believe I could trust this maker>>><<<I&#39;m confused...the internet connection is that so you can play games directly from the PICO 4 website without a PC , or is that for down loading soft wear???.🤔💕🇬🇧🇺🇦>>><<<This is a great review for someone trying to decide between a Pico 4 and Quest 2 for their first VR headset. Virtual Desktop makes the investment worth it, as it gets around the lack of Pico Store apps by letting you use those from the Quest Store. As for there being no audio jack, I would recommend the AD ADTRIP USB C Splitter; it is slightly long, but very affordable and better than the 2-port adapters available.>>><<<The larger sweet spot, FOV and this resolution is really tempting over the Q2. Their next headset should be amazing, they&#39;ve earned their place.>>><<<slippery and extremely undermining road for VR in general this approach that this US Meta are using by banning the best standalone VR titles from other stand alone devices.<br>It will create tensions like we also see on Xbox and Playstation with certain people using an extremely black &amp; white perspective depending on which fraction your into bed with.. <br>Why not let as many people as posiible be able to enjoy good content, and .dont have to purchase another expensive VR headset just to play certain titles that could easily be played on a product they alreayd have with the exact same SoC and Android based OS, not to mention the e-waste.<br>but its US Meta (Facebook).. common logic&#39; and simply having an eye on the biggger picture and the greater good for the masses, useally dont take center there.<br>I dont have a VR headset, but not a fan of that rancid Meta-approach..>>><<<Comfort and light leakage was my biggest issue with it too. Having a big nose, I also found it dug into my nose too.  I would definitely consider buying again (I returned it) if there&#39;s a decent 3rd party facial interface.  But I suspect it could be QUITE a wait, as most 3rd party companies are probably going to wait and see how it sells first.>>><<<Sounds a bit familiar>>><<<I see that little ATF Juggy in there 😎<br>Wicked Review!>>><<<No 3,5 mm jack is instant NOPE>>><<<Bought this, absolutely awful. Lets light in from the sides so you can see the room in the lenses, downloaded one game war planes which i played on the quest 2, writing was blurry, controls way too sensitive. Tried to watch Amazon prime movies, just a blank screen with sound. Most disappointing was the environment, very basic, even typing on the virtual keyboard was awful if you wanted to use special characters like # or $. Compared to the quest 2, it was night and day. The quest 2 is like a smart phone, the pico 4 is like a nokia 5190 for those of us who are old enough to remember them. It was so dreadful, I&#39;ve sold it after a day.>>><<<Only problem for me is lack of gamez>>><<<Great review, I only heard about Pico recently.  I’ve looked into index, htc etc.  and have a Quest2, but I needed to know something on this one.  Covered all the bases, love your work:)>>><<<is there a way to buy and play lone echo 2 on pico 4?>>><<<Good review. I&#39;ll stick with the three quest 2&#39;s we use in my house (mine and my 2 daughters). Video definitely deserved a like.>>><<<My pico 4 arrived today. Setting everything up reminded me of when I did the same routine with the Quest 2 in 2020. Only this time I was not struggling to find the sweet spot. Constantly adjusting the headset. Avoiding scratching the lenses with my glasses. Suffering the face plate pressed against my face, determined to really enjoy this new VR experience. I bought the Q2 mainly to watch TV and films on a huge screen with total immersion. I never got that. Faceplate after face plate, strap after strap, counter-weight after counter-weight.  Little did I know that my stubbornness would last over 18 months until I gave up on it. It will soon be on Ebay and good riddance to it. Now, having learned with the Q2 I was wary of the P4 but right out of the box I felt that same childlike eagerness to use it as I felt with the quest but this time I was not disappointed. It is so much better than the Q2, so much lighter and the sweet spot is huge.Yes, the faceplate is a little rough but it is not clamped to my face as the quest was. And wearing glasses is easy peezy. The longest I wore the Q2 was 40 minutes and most of that time was spent adjusting the headset. I lost track of time with the P4 tonight. You know it&#39;s there but it is not dominating your time in VR. I know I can never have those two years back but with this unit, I&#39;ll certainly try to make up for that lost time.>>><<<My Pico 4 arrived yesterday, thankfully.  It took a while to get it comfy, but then I didn&#39;t suffer the same issues as Mike.  I have had a 0G Quest, and usually rock a Reverb G2, but wanted some cable free action.  Not as visually impressive as the G2 - but everything else ticks the right boxes and it&#39;s not Meta.  Woot!   Right now, Virtual Desktop is a must have though - the Pico option is not up to the task (at time of writing).>>><<<Yes the 🐐 is back>>><<<So in a few words not worth an upgrade>>><<<Argh no audio jack everyone keeps making the same booby.........but most will use the built in speakers I guess. I can&#39;t remember the amount of times I regret buying a phone with no headphone jack after losing all those USB C to 3.5 adaptors! It does look really good though. Me wants!>>><<<An actual balanced review of the Pico 4. I&#39;ve seen some other channels discuss it and suggest &quot;should I upgrade to the Pico 4 from the Quest 2?&quot; With the implication that its clearly better all around. My initial thoughts were &quot;It doesnt make sense for me to switch horses for such a modest gain especially with the cost ive sunk into stand alone games.&quot; and it seems to kind of bare out as true I guess. It is nice to have another device out there though even if it isnt the right choice for me currently. Thanks for the review.>>><<<Software looks just like Quests>>><<<Damn Kind of wish I got a Pico instead of the Quest 2. My main gripe being the ipd. I batter to get that sweet spot as its in between the 3 shitty click settings.>>><<<I own a quest 1 and I was thinking about the quest pro, however that was back when we still thought it would be around 800 usd. I might pick up the pico 4 pro, since it will have all the fancy stuff and the software will be more mature>>><<<How much is it in money no £>>><<<I would consider this a clear upgrade if the new Quest Pro controllers didn&#39;t exist. Anything that uses LED strips just seems primitive by comparison.>>><<<Nice honest review. Pico 4 is a fantastic standalone headset. For me I&#39;m very much into PCVR and while this seems to give a good experience, I already own a G2 and the through the lens footage on the internet is showing the G2 significantly better. If I were to buy a standalone headset, I would probably get the Quest Pro over the Pico 4 as the mixed reality experience really fascinates me.  I&#39;m not sure, but why couldn&#39;t Pico have provided 2 colour passthrough cameras for a 3D stereoscopic display?>>><<<I have never had a vr headset but I can afford either a quest 2 or a poco 4.<br>I want to primarily game so which one do you recommend?>>><<<Thanks for the honest review. Everyone else seems to be over hyping the image quality. Nice to hear that it&#39;s about on par with Quest 2. I&#39;ll stick to my Aero.>>><<<Would it be a good idea to buy pico 4 when you already have a quest 2?>>><<<I do not want to support a Bytedance CCP headset.>>><<<Didn&#39;t know it was owned by the tik token company. Can we get an affordable vr that doesn&#39;t have people constantly gathering our info ffs lol isn&#39;t tik tok in trouble for gathering face data and now they&#39;re getting this directly on your face? 💀>>><<<My ipd is not quite symmetrical. I wonder how much of a difference it would make to be able to move each lens independently relative to the nose of my bridge.>>><<<The only question I have is, does it come black? I&#39;m only half serious, but I really do hate white hardware. It gets dirty way too quick and I&#39;m not the kind of person that constantly wipes everything down every time I use it.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=803">13:23</a> MRTV show some adapter - 3.5mm and Type-C in one device, so there are solution already 👍>>><<<you take your tea the same as I do. Hey Mike. Your videos are so nicely done. Hi to your puppy and family.>>><<<in 10 years time we&#39;ll realize we&#39;ve been wearing VR contact lenses for the past 2000 years but we just forgot to take them off.>>><<<Super disappointed there isn&#39;t a headphone jack!!! That&#39;s the one thing I NEEDED!>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=520">8:40</a> the same problem i had with Pico Neo 3 Link (i sold it already and ordered Pico 4), but you are the 1st reviewer who said about this problem 👍>>><<<Well it is a quest killer for me as I&#39;ll sell my Quest 2 for only one reason: the quest is very uncomfortable to wear.. so I rarely use it, I even play much more with the old PSVR 1. The pico is my new PCVR headset and the coming PSVR 2 will be my main headset for gaming. Being comfortable for longer than just a few minutes is very important for me. I have quite a huge head. Maybe the quest is more acceptable if you have a smaller head. Don&#39;t know.>>><<<I just had to send back my quest 2 because the controller drifted and I&#39;m planning on buying these... So how is the quality? The dead pixel scares me. And my glasses are big and had problems to use them in quest 2, space inside in pico is better?>>><<<Looking to finally get into VR, so...what is the current generation, beyond those from last year...I plan to buy late this year or 2023 so I&#39;m wondering if I should wait or who is the front runner or best bang for the buck. In the US.>>><<<I&#39;ve just got a Rift S still. Is this headset much of an improvement over that? I don&#39;t really play games on these. Only would use for VR simulation and racing/flying sims.>>><<<Love the competition. I&#39;m hoping wifi 6e in newer headsets will improve wireless PCVR streaming. Lightweight wireless VR is the dream for quality>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=157">2:37</a><br>The exact moment that my dreams of having a great vr headset without the downsides of the Quest 2 were shattered>>><<<You can still order it for Amazon here in the states it just will take longer to get here. With that headset it seems like it has all the same problems that the quest to have when it first launched so once we start getting third party accessories I&#39;m sure it will make that headset much more comfortable>>><<<Well there are some new headphones that you can use that were made for virtual reality and their Bluetooth which I&#39;m sure you already know about>>><<<Not a great alternative when it&#39;s own by yet another social media company.>>><<<Quote- you don&#39;t need a tictoc account to use it.  Yeah not yet. That&#39;s exactly what Oculus promised when they were bought out by Facebook. I have a reddit response from Palmer Lucky himself promising that.>>><<<if they added a displyport this would have been THE vr headset for literally everyone>>><<<Bytedance…  privacy is my concern.>>><<<I have bought one today. Its for xmas🤯🤯🤯🤯😌😄😄😄>>><<<Quest 2 + loader is the killer ...>>><<<TY for the video!<br>If i have some games on the oculus, do i need to buy them again for the pico?>>><<<I would like to hear in the review about tests how much data does it transfer to China, what data is stored on Chinese servers.>>><<<Great product.  No library of top titles so interim pass for sure.>>><<<Typical strongly (negatively) biased  review from a VR Youtuber who is paid from META! Simply ridiculous!>>><<<So I have a Q1, would you say that I should rather go for Q2, or Pico 4?<br>100% pc vr is going to be a factor for me>>><<<Thank you for the detailed review.>>><<<I think what is cool about the motorised IPD is that if different people use it, they can just use their accounts>>><<<Yeah I have a dead pixel on my quest 2 ugh>>><<<i&#39;m getting pico4 in 4 days i hope :)>>><<<Nice review, finally someone notices the similarity with the Pico and ‘Ready Player One’ lol… my only concern is motion sickness as that’s what’s been putting me off buying any VR headset>>><<<Dang the editing is ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤>>><<<A great review and as a long time follower and owner of PSVR, Oculus Rift, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest and Quest 2, I have enjoyed keeping up with VR information. I ordered my Pico 4 and recieved it yesterday (Launch Day) and very impressed with the visuals. I have slowly but surely moved to more games via the PC, with Steam and cross buy of the Oculus/Meta games, means many are now available to my PC. Only a few Star Wars games limited to Quest 2 so I will be keeping this. Competition is a good thing to have so I really welcome this release.<br>Also with the headphone adaptor, you can find a longer version USB C to headphone with charging upto 60w on Amazon if you want to add that option.>>><<<Please someone make a non-stand alone headset again, I don&#39;t want to pay for heavier headset with high tech chips I&#39;m never gonna use>>><<<It is made by bytedance... why the F. would I sell my soul the chinese SPY PARTY.>>><<<It’s gonna be so cool if sidequest could work on pico devices>>><<<Cheers for not clickbaiting QuEsT 2 KiLleR?!?!?>>><<<Looks like a great competitor, I look forward to seeing what they do to it in the future. That being said, I&#39;ll probably stick with my Quest 2 as I already have a good library that I&#39;d rather not have to repurchase.>>><<<Dont forget the pico pro>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=925">15:25</a> ahahahahahahahahah>>><<<fantastic review. covered all the things i wanted to learn about the headset. thanks>>><<<is this available in the US?>>><<<I need to know I am getting a VR headset for standalone games not PCVR which headset should I get please help right now I am looking and Pico 4 and Meta Quest 2 please let me know>>><<<Beatsaber won&#39;t be coming any time soon lol.>>><<<Wait, the wired image quality is <b>worse</b> than wireless? What is the point of having the wired option then? What is it for? Just for people who like falling over some wires? 😄>>><<<Great video thanks!  Because of this excellent review I am binning my Quest 2 and getting a Pico 4!>>><<<Is it going to acquire titles like bonelab, beatsaber, stuff like that in the future?>>><<<i still have the oculus rift cv1  and i am looking for an low price alternative to connect to my pc.<br>the rift2 is not anvailable in my country and i need alot of space for my glasses or special lenses for the vr system. most intern visionadaptation is not enough for me to get a clear picture... the large gabs on the side sounds nice for my big head maybe  the pico 4 is the one i was looking for ...but are there anny protectors for the lenses anvailable? as i said my glases are special and on oculus rift i tapt the lenses alot with may glasses until i got a pare of  bonus lenses in my vision parameters.  i am scared of scratshing the lenses  :/>>><<<They literally copied quest 2’s whole system UI😂😂 it’s from china we are not surprised>>><<<Pico won’t be getting advanced chip like meta in the future😂>>><<<I hate meta, but I also hate bytedance- gimme  A headset that isn&#39;t backed by a shadowy cabal plz>>><<<I get motion sick af. It&#39;s my first VR headset and I am not convinced at all by VR after that first use yesterday. The image is really bad (blurry) when you need to read text or stuff. I tried every setting of the lenses. It gets close but still shitty. Maybe my face is just weird. Will test with the spacer again later, maybe that helps. But as for now.. meh.. better wait 1-2 more yrs.>>><<<Quest 2 is way batter.>>><<<how would it look choppy when the video is only at 30FPS?>>><<<I like Mike. But this is yet another mainstream review laden with caveats to appease Meta. The take home for me is this: as a pcvr headset it’s superior to the Quest 2. It’s cheaper. It is more enjoyable watching media content on the Pico 4 than it is in the Quest 2. The controllers are superior in terms of tracking. <br>Sure you could argue it isn’t a Quest 2 killer, but it’s definitely not it’s equal, it is superior. The only point I’d concede is the software/features need some work. <br>Too many Meta ambassadors on YT with one eye on Zuck.>>><<<Dead pixel on arrival? I hope I will be lucky with my unit. I enjoyed dead pixels with my pimax and I don&#39;t want to experience it again. Great review.>>><<<Get Pico 4 or wait for PSVR2? Sold my quest 2 and dont want to get another one at this point..>>><<<Hey VR Oasis, Excellent review! <br>Have you tried the USB type C 3.5mm adapters that allow pass-through charging? There are a quite a few adapters on amazon, for example.>>><<<Is there a way to have your quest 2 library on your pico 4??>>><<<the original pico neo 3 (non link) supported the vr usb-c port on the 2000 series nvidia cards....................does this one support that feature?>>><<<know htc vive are teasing a new headset. if it is ther same as the pico 4 but with WIGIG 2 wifi that would make me happy. as good pc wireless headset with low latency WIGIG2 wouldd be nice>>><<<Just unboxed my Pico 4, and my first impression was... DISAPPOINTED 😭😭😭<br><br>The face cushion is so stiff, it pressed my face much more than the Quest 2, I didn&#39;t feel it light at all. It also left ugly marks on my face just after a few minutes of play. Terrible. 😣<br><br>There was no tracking at all until I set the boundaries, it made me feel dizzy.<br><br>The worst bug: if I shake my head quickly, the whole scene moves with my head like there was no tracking at all. This doesn&#39;t happen with the Quest 2. Very annoying...<br><br>The color pass-through is also very bad. Objects that are 1.5m tall were displayed as flat on the floor... The depth sensor is clearly missing, without that it&#39;s a mess.<br><br>Overall, the Pico 4 is a huge disappointment, I think I&#39;ll cry.... And will sell it as soon as I can. 😞>>><<<I love watching movies in VR and for me this would be a compelling buy, but.... No headphone jack is a deal-breaker.  I&#39;ll pass, sadly.>>><<<This is the first time I heard someone mention the controllers having capacitive sensors, which not having them was a major con for me at first, so if this is true, I have nothing to worry about in VRChat>>><<<I own a quest 2 and don&#39;t need this at the moment. But even if i considered buying it i wouldn&#39;t do it it because of the lack of headphone jack. It&#39;s a big con for me.>>><<<what i think about pico 4 is, they must have a better option in anyway than quest 2 if not this headset will not have a competitive value, and its not a quest killer but how to survived from quest 2 not killed after they launch and sell their headset thats what my opinion>>><<<tbh i would feel kinda scammed buying this 😅>>><<<seems crazy you can&#39;t plug headphones in>>><<<💥 Loving your in-depth review buddy… been a fan for ages. This cements you as an honest non biased reviewer. Respect- Lee Marvin Hitchman LADbible/Shaun Attwood/ Neil Samworth’s Real Porridge etc … 💥>>><<<how to connect Pico 4 to TV?>>><<<lol, it reminds me of the vive focus 3>>><<<As you said you could not try the fitness app or parties pre-release. Now it is released can you comment on these features? Did the pass through get any better moving from OS 5.0 to 5.2.0?>>><<<Thanks for the great review. Was really looking forward to seeing this. I hope the headset does well and brings more people to VR. Definitely a competitor at a reasonable price.>>><<<Imagine, in 12 months when Quest 3 releases, probably the Pico 5 will too. If the latter has eye tracking, it might be a game changer (at least for PC VR users).>>><<<Nice one Mike>>><<<cant wait for your Arpara review>>><<<The lack of an audio jack is a deal breaker for me>>><<<I can&#39;t help but think the reviewer was underwhelmed. I&#39;ve ordered one purely because the Quest 2 has a single screen whereas the Pico 4 has two dedicated screens, which is perfect for those of us with a larger IPD. This is a big deal, but was glossed over, here.>>><<<Thanks for the review Mike and for covering the PCVR section in such detail, cheers! 👍>>><<<It may not have Beat Saber but it does have Smash Drums (with 3 extra songs)>>><<<There is an issue with the lenses, surprised you didn&#39;t mention it more. It&#39;s fine when gaming but really noticable in the home environments and when the keyboard and menu systems>>><<<Why does the interface look like the quests lol>>><<<Bought my new Quest 2 at 349€... sold it last week at 349€ when i saw the Pico 4. But i&#39;m not buying it now, i&#39;ll wait sometimes to see the evolution. But if I needed a VR headset now, i&#39;d definitely choose the Pico 4. For the people who say &quot;ThE QueSt iS BetTEr, FuCk PiCo!&quot;... you&#39;re just mad you bought a Quest for the same price or higher. These are both good headset, but the pancake lenses and the weight distribution would be enough for me to go for the Pico. The quest 2 is not enjoyable with the original strap and all that weight on the nose. Althought i don&#39;t have a giant nose, without the glass spacer i could not use the Quest 2 cause of the pain. Alleluja!>>><<<Looks like someone got our back for when Meta will inevitably go bankrupt due to all the stupid s* they&#39;re doing right now :D<br><br>Thanks for the in-depth and complete review, don&#39;t apologise for the long video!>>><<<&quot;Owned by bytedance&quot;. That&#39;s where I turned off the video.>>><<<Hi. Does it work with Quest 2&#39;s pirated apps/games?>>><<<Comfort is a biggie for me cf Q2>>><<<Thank you for honest review.<br>The front foam feels very comfortable to me, maybe we have differently shaped heads. But there is a bit of light leakage on the sides.<br>Also - you can use both link cable and audio jack using hub.>>><<<Damn i bought quest 2 a week ago should i sell it or keep it?>>><<<isnt it horrible youd need to repurchase your entire games library. absolute deal breaker>>><<<128 or 256 ?>>><<<Something I’m struggling with when it comes to VR like quest or peco, these companies aren’t the most trustworthy, having data and privacy issues but make such appealing VR products…>>><<<How can pico shamelessly copy entire quest UI to their headset as if that is a ok thing>>><<<Looks like you beat thrill to it damn>>><<<Nice review and thorough review. I got myself the Pico 4 after testing it at a roadshow, its quite abit cheaper in my region compared to the Quest 2 and way more comfortable. <br>I do have to say in regards to your point about fit, VR is a very personal thing and fits different people differently, I have a rounder and bigger head so the Pico 4 fits me perfectly with zero light leaks whereas the Quest 2 was way too snug and pinching the area around my eyes. So my advice is always try to find a test unit first to try out the fit before buying>>><<<Can i play gorilla tag on it?>>><<<thanks for honest review mate. for sure vrcover and bobovr had cook something of their sleeve for this bad boy.>>><<<My god! The shiny black front was sucking the fingerprints right off me just watching the video!<br>My VR upgrade had been long overdue and I have been watching the Pico with great interest. But I think I will be looking around for a decent second hand quest 2 and wait for the psvr 2 for the main course.<br>Awesome video as always!>>><<<Great for some AMOGUS VR>>><<<It’s not an alternative but a better option 😅>>><<<Quest 2 better than pico 4 it&#39;s true>>><<<The Meta exclusive games are not the &#39;Horizon Zero Dawn&#39; type of games, so I will not miss one of them. I think in the long run, the Pico-Store will be superior, if the Devs can sell in China too. I will get the Pico 4 today, bye bye dusty Quest2.>>><<<Hey Mike is there a new Podcast for you that i can catch you on?>>><<<Cool. I’ll wait for the Quest 3.  Thank you!>>><<<Oh boy, I&#39;ve been waiting for this video...let me just drop the kid off to school and get comfortable...>>><<<Samsung where are you?>>><<<Looks like a true bootleg>>><<<Finally, a real assessment, is it worth reselling your Quest 2 to Pico 4? Not sure. You know, I bought a belt for the waist 3 months ago, Made in China, it only lasted 2 months to break, I&#39;ve never bought something that comes from China and is of good quality. We see it here with the &quot;deadpixel&quot;, cheap products, cheap parts. Pay you for what you have.  For those who ordered a Pico 4 from America, good luck with warranty and returns.>>><<<Still waiting for the pimax crystal>>><<<Owned by TikTok that’s enough information. A communist company that collects data on users.>>><<<Sail is coming soon to Pico VR :)>>><<<You know i really think this headset seems good, but there is one thing, the fact that the quest 2 has a replaceable headstrap is so good, because mine&#39;s battery is pooped and only lasts an hour, but now i have a confortable headstrap with hot swappable battery backs and i havent had to worry about charge since, i&#39;m sure solutions like that will come to the pico 4, but ima keep my quest 2 with infinite battery<br>Edit: I finished the video and i see that bobovr has already done it, but no interchangeable headstrap :(>>><<<I live in China, so not needing to use a VPN to use this instead of the Quest is tempting...>>><<<Solid review, but I&#39;m still considering replacing my Quest2 with the Pico4 simply because the visual sweetspot is too small on the Quest2 and it&#39;s too front heavy.>>><<<If I wasn&#39;t so deep into the Quest 2 with the shear amount of games I&#39;ve purchased, I would totally have bought this. It seems better in terms of hardware in almost every way compared to the Quest 2.>>><<<Good evening Mike great review video on the pico 4 I deftly looking into getting a headset that can do both PC VR and standalone VR. Have a good evening Mike.>>><<<How is the comfort in Quest 2 out of the box? Its more expensive headset and i hear you have to buy elite strap because its so uncomfortable.>>><<<I hope they release a narcissistic app that lets me dance like an idiot in my living room>>><<<Definitely more competition is welcome! Although I am a little concerned about how Byte Dance owns Pico...<br>I hope privacy is some what at a respectable level, and not turn into TikTok and collect and sell user data and provide it to the Chinese government...<br><br>Sure Meta is just as bad, but I trust Meta with my data more then a Chinese company who collects more data from TikTok then every other social media around...>>><<<One of the biggest Arguments for the Pico is for me the huge Sweet Spot. this should really improve the experience>>><<<Surprised you you didn&#39;t say anything about not being able to switch head straps since you have a love affair with your Bobo strap!>>><<<That&#39;s a nice looking headset. I still have the first Oculus Quest but not sure whether to wait>>><<<Chinese communist party VR headset. No thanks>>><<<not  a quest 2 killer easy .....the games ok  ....didn&#39;t have to watch the whole video bye ! <br><br>Oh also probably the software but we all forget quest 2 took 2 years !!!!! to get where it is now>>><<<i received mine last week, and im loving it! for once i can buy games in my currency, it was way more comfortable than the Meta ones and the face cushion wasnt as bad for me, and the weight, my god so light, my only gripe is the controller buttons dont feel as premium as quest, but thats a minor feeling, i do also wish it had more productivity and leisure apps on their store>>><<<Why in the world would they not include the headphone jack?  That is kind of dumb in my opinion.>>><<<Hey Mike is the ability to just load up apk files and install them on the headset easily still in this one? Cheers!>>><<<Sucks if you have a quest and want this you will have to buy all the games again>>><<<I currently have a quest 1. 99% of the time I&#39;m playing PC VR content, wirelessly. Would you recommend the Pico 4 or quest 2 as an upgrade?>>><<<Great video! Loved hearing your insight on this product, curious if they will ever come to the states>>><<<Does this run Android like the Quest 2?>>><<<If all these devices are going to have their own exclusive game stores then I’m not buying any of them.

I fancied another and had to choose between buying another quest and keeping my old game library or trying out the new pico. Glad I went for the pico! Where I live it&#39;s about £70 cheaper than the quest, but with the lenses, screens and other more modern hardware I had to give it a try. It really is a nice upgrade over the quest 2 especially in the comfort and weight but you&#39;re definitely right about software.

What was the lowest possible latency you could achieve using Virtual Desktop?>>><<<So much smaller then the quest 2 ??? Why do you compare them without the light shield. It’s not like they can be used without? What kind of bias review is this?>>><<<What about watching movies is it better than quest 2?  I enjoy using big screen and other videos apps on quest.   No one has said anything about movie quality so just curious.  Thanks>>><<<Do you need a pc for it?? And do you need one for the Cambria bc I will purchase that when it gets out>>><<<i wonder how it works on linux, and if not now, ift it will later>>><<<I’m still rocking a rift s and I haven’t been very happy with it but I also don’t wanna buy a quest 2. This might be my new headset, it seems pretty darn good.>>><<<Is the Pico better than the Quest 2?>>><<<i’m considering it, but i’m poor lol.>>><<<If they fix that link quality and somebody makes a 3rd party face cover then it seems perfect>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=615">10:15</a> Why would a dead pixel show up on the recording? sounds more like a software issue.>>><<<Great review look forward to the pro version>>><<<Not worth it. Quest 2 still superior.>>><<<The Pico would be my very first VR Headset. Sooo did I get it right, that I can play Beat-Saber and other games via Steam?>>><<<Thanks for the review Mike. Can you in your view can you tell us how this unit compares to the PSVR2. Thank you in advance.>>><<<Nobody mentions if you login to social apps do you find friends from Oculus there?<br>(Does it login to the same social media servers as oculus?)>>><<<Hey guys, I&#39;m just thinking about buying my first VR headset. I&#39;m thinking about PICO 4 more sice I&#39;ll play PC VR...mostly. BUT Since I never had any VR headset I don&#39;t know how all this SW works. I understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms. But let&#39;s say I want to play beat saber I can play it via PCVR but what about Lone echo? Somewhere I came across information that Quest games can be run normally on PC via their app and then streamed to the headset via VR desktop. So is it possible to play Quest 2 exclusive games this way on PICO 4? Or do I have to resign myself to losing these games?>>><<<Swag man>>><<<If Pico and Pico Pro manage to supply the world demand, it will crush the Quest Pro>>><<<Is there any news on this headset releasing to North America?>>><<<got my Pico 4 today, it&#39;s a definite hardware upgrade over the Quest 2. Biggest things I like are the lens and comfort. the face gasket has slight light bleed which is annoying but overall if you don&#39;t have any VR headset Pico 4 is the way to go now for the foreseeable future.>>><<<I bet the guys at Pico were VERY HAPPY when Meta announced the MSRP of the Quest 2 was raised from €349 to €449.>>><<<i have a rift s. i&#39;m looking for an upgrade, but maybe i&#39;ll wait for quest 3 or something. The resolution and fov on the rift s are pretty bad nowadays.>>><<<i would buy it if it got 120 hz....>>><<<For the Pico 4, I found for my head that if I raise the headstrap a little bit higher than what feels intuitive, I get a much more even pressure distribution on the facial interface. I also had the exact same experience with wired/wireless PCVR streaming. It seems to be locked to 40mbps streaming and the detail is noticably poor until I keep still for about a second or two. Virtual Desktop is significantly better to the point where I can play even while using a less than ideal router. The battery life should definitely be more like 8000mAh out of the box, but besides that I&#39;m loving it!>>><<<on VRChat ppl keep saying its the best yet it just came out and 99.99% of them never try it>>><<<Alos mike any news on pico 4 pro ??>>><<<This or psvr2 &#39;?>>><<<Are there free games on the pico store?>>><<<Is it normal that I lost 20% of battery only in 20min with pico 4?>>><<<“A cheeky little like on the video” 😂>>><<<How come your content is so similar to other youtube channels like cas and chary vr? It seems like you both put out almost exactly the same videos. Is there some YouTube/oculus or company sponsorship going on?>>><<<Perhaps you should buy one for a fan of the channel when you get sent these early so you actually have some skin in the game.  I feel like your review would be more believable and also more true to form on what it will be like for retail people to actually buy it.  Could improve the whole experience.  Not saying you are lying but I feel like reviewers really don’t seem to realize that there is an extreme risk for you to have an unconscious bias when this is the set-up for review.  You seem like a really nice guy.  Just some food for thought perhaps.  P.S. I’m not trying to get your free stuff.  Give it to one of these kids or someone with less money who can’t afford one if anything.  I’m flawed too.  Not saying I am not.>>><<<Do you recommend any Specific site to buy it im located in mexico, im going to buy a headset and i was on the fence between quest 2 or pico 4 will be mainly using it for pcVR>>><<<Mike what is the ps5 vr like compared topico4 / hp reverb g2 plz no one else has mentioned them ??? keep up the good work m8>>><<<Me: Wow, Mike is such a wholesome youtuber.<br>Mike : <b>Motions middle finger up and down</b> <br>Me: wtf🤣>>><<<Preordered one coming from the original quest. Wanted something for pc vr as well as getting out of the Meta ecosystem before getting sucked in completely. Let’s see how it goes. Looks promising at least>>><<<Were not there just yet, but 2025 will be insane>>><<<Thanks Mike, great video as ever. Completion in the VR space can only be a good thing. I have a Quest 2 and am hoping that the Quest 3 can learn from the Quest Pro (I know the Quest 3 is not a Pro upgrade, I mean tech wise for gaming) and Pico 4 to be a real step up, hopefully next year.>>><<<i was about to buy the neo 4 until i saw that vrchat wasn&#39;t on pico store.<br>i love my quest but i need the pico for the ipd and i also wanna try the new controllers, so sad about not being able to play vrchat on the pico :(>>><<<Wow, Pico straight up cloned the Quest 2 software.>>><<<100% we will see vr goggles the size of sunglasses within 5 years.>>><<<was really hoping that the pico would be comfortable so that i can forget that im wearing it during a movie.>>><<<would Virtual Desktop work with the link cable or with the dongle adapter Pico is going to release?>>><<<Stop recommending these products to people It is literally owned by the CCP It is not care about permissions it steals everything it can and very very soon as soon as conflict breaks out they have no obligation to continue supporting it software-wise these are the same people that blatantly steal copyrighted materials left and right on a daily basis look at the headset itself for fuck sakes it&#39;s a quest to with a black strip in the bottom that was developed without having to innovate anything simply using hardware that&#39;s 3 years more advantageous because of when it came out and then comparing them like they are apples and oranges. Any money you send to them leaves the country and never comes back and fuels the war machine. You have an ethical obligation to not push this crap>>><<<I was very pumped to see a non quest headset… until I saw it was made by TikTok.<br><br><br>Pass.>>><<<Upgrading from a Rift S, I feel like I&#39;m gonna need some extra stuff like VR desktop and maybe even the BOBOVR batteries to not have it be a downgrade from direct PCVR yet for wireless tech, aswell as how fed up I am with my worsening set, I&#39;d buy it one way or another.<br><br>Shame a 20$ software is the only good method for PC streaming tho, real surprised pico&#39;s own app isn&#39;t as good...>>><<<Mike, great review as always. I primarily use Quest 2 for PCVR and you mentioned it&#39;s not a generational leap forward. However, given the better lenses, and better resolution, will I notice a significant clarity difference, and is Beat Saber properly playable at something like Expert+ where very fast movement is necessary? I keep hearing the video compression is really bad, and Virtual Desktop is the way forward - is it good enough for Beat Saber and similar games, in your opinion?>>><<<Great review, Mike! Love how everyone flips the bird when showing hand tracking. Lol😅>>><<<My wifi is 530mbps download and 30-40mbps upload. Is that good enough for virtual desktop?>>><<<Great vid, cant wait for mine to arrive :D>>><<<What personal data do you need to give for a Pico account>>><<<Facebook: 🤢👎<br>Tik Tok: 🤮👎👎>>><<<Wow no headphone jack.. what a trash design. Sure it&#39;s a simple thing, that some may not use, but being able to charge and hear (properly) simultaneously keeps the quest 2 ahead in my book.>>><<<I wonder if something like resident evil could just be sideloaded>>><<<Whats the diffrence in a Pico  Neo and just Pico??>>><<<Being a lighter headset it will be a great addition to my Quest2. I&#39;m retired, so I can use the Quest2 in the morning for my Holofit and FitRX and in the evening take out the Pico and play some Bonelab, Half Life Alyx mods or MiniGolf... and at the moment Half Life 2 VR. During those games is when I feel the weight of the Quest most.... Looking forwards to get the Pico4.>>><<<Hi Mike, do you notice the warp/scaling error of the Pico 4 which causes your view to slightly warp if you turn your head ? This has already been an issue on the Pico 3, reported serveral times to the developers, but has not been resolved yet, even with the lastest firmware on the Pico 4. The wrong scaling is present on both native and PCVR and should never have been approved by quality control in my opinion. Some people may not notice this, but if you have had other headsets like the Rift or Quest 2 you immediately should see that there is something off here. In some games it&#39;s not that apparent , but others are just unplayable and feel jittery as hell.>>><<<I like brightness and game access.  Quest 2 it is.   Thanks mike>>><<<Hi VRO! I was wondering if you would suggest buying a Pico 4, if you’re going from a quest 1 with link?>>><<<Waiting for pico 4 ( pro) A Great Quest (pro) Alternative>>><<<The audio bluetooth latency will be an issue. <br><br>I had thought that they would remove the compression needed for pcvr by now. Wasn&#39;t there supposed to be a optional dedicated dongle to connect directly to the pc? Wouldn&#39;t that help in removing the compression requirement?<br><br>Otherwise this is a great product. I hope they make those improvements in the next iteration. if they can use OLED display with higher refresh rate then that would be amazing.>>><<<was that a G-shoch watch ?>>><<<oh man, what a review. Really well done.<br>I still got the Oculus Rift S. I love this device, absolutely do, but it IS getting old now. The FOV of that thing is just ruining a lot of immersion.<br>I might now order the Pico 4 soon thanks to this review. BUT I might still wait for the Lenovo VR700. Not sure yet.>>><<<i really dont like this move for headsets using magnetic padding. It probably is fine at this level of strength of magnets but it is a fact that we know that magnets can affect the brain in various ways, the most dramatic of which is if you put a strong enough one over a specific area it will affect the fusiform face gyrus which will result in you not being able to see faces while its in place. again there is probably nothing to worry about in this vr headset use case but i&#39;d just prefer other methods of attachment for such things myself>>><<<a ccp tech device is never a great alternative>>><<<If this and the Quest 2 are neck and neck, not needing a facebook account to use the Pico 4 easily gives it the W for me.>>><<<Woah I am skipping out on this device TikTok is even worse than Facebook I will just stick with Windows Mixed Reality it might not be 4k but you&#39;re headset isn&#39;t owned by these people I have nothing nice to say about TikTok it really is a surveillence system don&#39;t buy the Pico headset get a Samsung HMD Odyssey+ Windows Mixed Reality Headset it&#39;s good enough.>>><<<more resolution but worse display, less weight but less comfortable….. mmmmh>>><<<i would defenitily buy a pico, but they are not sold in country yet>>><<<It looks like a very good alternative, although it seems to be the same experience you would have with a Quest 2, even the interface, arrangement/layout, widget, and window colors, all look the same as the Quest 2, I wonder if Pico found that Meta`s software experience is already great and just trying to copied the same in order catch some of that audience, anyway great video Mike!>>><<<You’re my favorite VR YouTuber, it’s always very exciting to see you upload new videos, and thrilling to see them!>>><<<I&#39;ve received my Pico 4 around 2 weeks ago, and I have enjoyed it alot. I generally play PCVR games and I did not know about virtual desktop. Thanks for the information.>>><<<@virtual reality oasis could you provide an update to let us know if prescription lens inserts are available for new devices like this one? because i got snap in lenses for quest 2 and I can never go back to wearing glasses under a vr headset>>><<<You can use USB-C adaptor that has both 3.5mm Jack, and USB-C passthrough>>><<<pico market is kind of new, just compared with the quest store 2 years ago its a much bigger gamestore that quest had. And Yes everything is better at this headset hardware wise as the quest. For me its still a QUESTKILLER.>>><<<How perfectly you drew your boundary was eerily satisfying.>>><<<I guess if you have the original quest, this would be a great upgrade :)>>><<<Lol how did you record the dead pixel?>>><<<Great review thankyou 👌>>><<<Are you sure it’s a dead pixel ? You wouldn’t be able to record it without capturing through the lense footage imo>>><<<The lack of an audio jack is stupid.>>><<<Love watching your videos!>>><<<The most honest review I’ve seen yet …. It’s not a Quest Killer>>><<<Great review, Mike! I&#39;m glad it ran &quot;a little long&quot;, as it allowed you to give us a thorough sense of what all the aspects of the Pico 4 are all about.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;m looking at the Pico Neo 3, since I only need a PCVR headset and want something that&#39;s a little more robust, visually speaking, than my Rift S. So far as I can tell, the price is about the same, and the G2 may be a bit too much for my PC&#39;s specs, since I&#39;m only running a  3060ti.<br><br>Should I make that leap, or hold on until the Quest 3 finally comes out? Or should I wait until Black Friday and go ahead and get the G2 anyway?>>><<<Is there any screen door effect?>>><<<Was that Half life @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=450">7:30</a>?>>><<<Meta still has the best software. The UI looks more polished and modern.>>><<<Good review! I will wait for the Quest 3 (and bought a second hand Quest 2 for €260, as new…). I’d rather invest in a ecosystems which is partly developped by and under supervision of GOAT John Garmack than a company which is steered by the Chinese government (CCP has a huge stake in Bytedance, which ownes Pico).>>><<<It’s a proper rip off>>><<<if ur thinking of buying a quest 2 for the 1st time buy this as it soo uch better and there is very few negatives where as quest 2 is near the end of its life>>><<<it looks like they copied so much from oculus>>><<<I see it as a Hardware vs Software issue. The Pico looks like a generally better headset, but Meta still has a huge leg up due to its exclusives like Beat Saber etc. If someone found a way to port these exclusives to Pico, I would buy it in a heartbeat. It really just depends on what you value more.>>><<<Quest 3 in 2023 🚀>>><<<Thanks Mike!  I have one coming from Amazon tomorrow for my pcvr library, which I built up when I owned an Index.  Valves lack of wireless support which they promised years ago, made me sell my Index, and I refused to buy into Metas ecosystem.  So this seems perfect for wireless pcvr which I have waited years for.  Thanks>>><<<I wish it was in the US :(>>><<<PICO... feels more like COPI>>><<<For PC VR players in Germany, this is a dream. There is, till this point, still no quest 2 available at official resellers. When you are mostly playing PC VR and will change a better feeling face padding anyway, this is in every single way a better choice.<br>Not saying it is better than quest 2 overall, but definitely a headset more suited for my need.>>><<<i have no money for this so i will keep using quest 2 for as long as possible>>><<<Hopefully someone can answer this for me: if I have virtual desktop on Steam, will I still need to buy it on the Pico store to use with Pico 4?>>><<<I feel like in many ways, it&#39;s two steps forward one step back. Good design in the strap with properly balanced weight, but you can&#39;t replace it. Decent-ish audio, but no 3.5mm headphone jack. Pancake lenses and high res display, but sluggish OS skin. Comfortable and decently tracked controllers, but bulky and heavy (And also, hard to make grips for, due to their strange shape). Color passthrough, but monoscopic and headache inducing. I hope software support will improve the headset wherever possible, and I hope first party hardware support with accesories will fix some of the issues, because right now it&#39;s looking good, but not as good as I hoped>>><<<can u fix a dead pixel>>><<<Hmmm, I’ll have to look into this, might be a competitor for the quest>>><<<Great coverage. It&#39;s a Quest 2 Competitor, and that&#39;s what we really need right now to make the market both more accessible and interesting.>>><<<does this include a modded beat saber? after side, quest come outs>>><<<Getting away from a Facebook required account is worth it to me.  I think it&#39;s sad that NO ONE commented on Facebook lying about removing the requirement last year at this years Facebook Connect event.>>><<<So a Quest 2+, minus the Meta/Facebook part. That&#39;s a win-win in my book.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=203">3:23</a> Clean your lens please>>><<<Wow they just ripped the ui right from oculus. It looks good. We just need some killer games.>>><<<What would be your recommendations for someone who has no VR headset at all and is wondering which one to get between the Pico 4 and the Quest 2? Let&#39;s say someone who would use both stand alone and PCVR.>>><<<Play some half life alyx workshop maps, they&#39;re unlimited and as good as the game. It&#39;s all I play in VR.>>><<<Why they dont add a dam micro sd slot is behond me.>>><<<The quest has a blurry look to it when I play . It just dosent look super clear and sharp when I watch a video feed of someone playing it live . Is the pico have this same issue ?>>><<<How much light in the room do you need to use this headset? can i play in the dark?>>><<<I’m not buying this since I ain’t trying to support tiktok>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uMxzBMwLY&amp;t=79">1:19</a> can we just appreciate this editing>>><<<nice>>><<<Great review! Thanks>>><<<Does it still look like you looking into a binocular in the Pico 4 headset? cus thats what annoy me the most with Quest 2 is that the black stuff around your vision>>><<<Wasn’t expecting that full Rick Sanchez while testing the hand tracking but there you were lol.>>><<<A sleek, sexy, balanced, light, comfortable, beautiful, USABLE design... this is the first case where I see a need for an American company to copy from a Chinese company.>>><<<Haha, I was literally binging reviews from channels I wasn&#39;t sure about, but then this comes out just in time, thanks a bunch!>>><<<The reason I will never buy a Quest product is their data harvesting and abhorrent privacy policy. How does this compare?>>><<<Definitely upgrading from my rift s, can&#39;t wait to see what wireless pcvr has to offer>>><<<This seems like a genuinely good option.>>><<<I’ll give u leopard for it lol>>><<<Pre-ordered for more power and better lenses also much better controllers than Quest 2!>>><<<Shame its not a halo type headset. Not sure I trust the company either. 🤔>>><<<Mike. You deserved a like from me for not calling it a &quot;Quest KILLER!!!!!!&quot; I&#39;d love to swap this with my Quest 2 for Virtual Desktop with my VRChat/Full Body setup (But I&#39;m in the US)>>><<<I&#39;m hoping for the VRCover too! I agree that is what it really needs.>>><<<where the 4k?>>><<<Is it a good standalone vr headset as I don&#39;t have a gaming PC  <br>Was waiting for the psvr2 but not sure I want wired vr>>><<<its from china and the personal data given is extreme. no its not a great alternative, its actually only slightly worst. unless of course you dont care about the ethical and moral dilemma of not owning your own digital shadow then yeah go for it. sell a little bit more of yourself to them.>>><<<Thank you for providing such Amazing content❤❤❤>>><<<they just stole oculus 💀>>><<<I bought the pico neo 3 link like 3 months ago because I didn&#39;t know the 4 was coming out do you think that&#39;s an L?>>><<<Amazing vid! Keep up the great work, dude! Much love ❤️❤️❤️>>><<<Got my pico 4 2 days ago but the face cushion is so freaking uncomfortable😭>>><<<But you would say that since it was free>>><<<I love to see that the VR Industry is expanding and some more great headsets are entering the market>>><<<10th>>><<<new mike headset review let&#39;s go>>><<<whenever i think of pico i just think of the sauce>>><<<I&#39;m gonna get the pico neo 4 on crismas>>><<<Thanks for the vid! Loving the content!!!>>><<<The pico 4 looks so cool>>><<<I always love it when you come out the new video>>><<<First>>><<<Hi>>><<<The pico 4 imo is better than the quest 2 because of the weight balance not being more on your forehead and the way the strap and lenses fit on my face and head feels much better than the quest 2>>><<<Good evening.Awesome,thank you very much.Extremly healthy,forever young,very beautiful,the best of luck,a lot of money,gold,diamonds,prosperity,wealthy,abundance,harmony, happiness and success in your life!🍀🏆💓 *>>><<<Is among us already available to the Pico 4? If so how much it cost?>>><<<If it wasn&#39;t for the ONLY fact that Pico 4 library is way more limited, i would surely chose it. Now i am always in a stalemate between quest 2, quest 3 and pico 4. Suggestions?>>><<<Any suggestions on how to get a new or like new one since I heard they aren’t available in the US? Thanks>>><<<I&#39;m new to exploring VR gaming so pardon my ignorant questions. If it&#39;s connected to a PC for PCVR gaming, can I still use my PC speakers for the sound output instead of the speakers on the headset? Or will I be hearing audio output from both the headset and my speakers? And also, I&#39;ve heard about having to sign up for an account or something when using those Meta VR headsets. Does this require an account? If it does, is an account absolutely necessary for PCVR gaming, especially for flight and racing sims?>>><<<Love the pico 4!>>><<<Can you use hotspot on iPhone 13 to connect too pico 4 looking at getting one but no wifi>>><<<Show don&#39;t tell, will ya!>>><<<quest 3 was able to connect to my PC through WIFI 6, and it had no lag, can this headset do that too ?>>><<<Any devices with removable batteries is a big plus for me, I use rechargeable AA and AAA batteries, I have a bunch of them fully charged. Whenever needed you do a quick swap instead of waiting for them to charge, and there are no worries of an internal battery that is difficult to replace when it breaks down.>>><<<Does it have any apps to watch cinema with your own 3d movie files ?>>><<<I just want a vr headset capable of watching vr movies while not having a fucking facebook account. Is is good for that?>>><<<Can I use Virtual Desktop to play wireless with my PC?>>><<<Am I missing something, or did you not really mention the visuals, or compare to anything for reference?>>><<<Rewatch your video and start counting how many times you touch your glasses, and don&#39;t include the times you touch them when you actually are mentioning your glasses. I&#39;ll bet you did not realize you are doing it that much in the span of 16 minutes ;-) Just watched a video with Norm from Tested and he has the same tic.>>><<<I love my Pico 4. I&#39;ve had it since launch. Sitting on about 70 games.>>><<<Would also mention you are still able to connect your Bluetooth headphones.>>><<<Unfortunately the PICO 4 isn&#39;t available in the US still.>>><<<Will the fiber optic Link cable keep this charged while playing?>>><<<How do movies and Youtube look, compared to the Q2?>>><<<So i got a totally noob question that i cant seem to find the answer to anywhere online. I recently bought a pico 4 and im trying to figure out how to change the profile pic from the default yellow dog to one of my avatars that i created. If anyone can answer that for me id greatly appreciate it. TIA.>>><<<can you use a headset plugged into your pc if you plug the pico into the pc? to use for vr audio>>><<<Waiting for the quest 3<br>Let me see which is better>>><<<It&#39;s just my first week into Pico 4, i am a Quest user, but the pico system has so much FREEDOM. I can finally use discord without headashes.<br><br>The extra ram makes a lot of difference. Besides the weaker library of games and apps, i really think that the Pico 4 is a way best option if you want a VR headset. Definelly not a Master upgrade if you are coming from Quest 2, but for sure a best hardware.>>><<<Can it play pavlov and Hot dog horseshoes and handgrenades... and Blade And Sorcery>>><<<Do you need a PC to use it>>><<<I tried my friend quest 2 and pico 4. Pico 4 lenses look much better, and the out of the box strap+the balanced weight give superior experience.>>><<<I liked the headset for its features but in some ways it is simply the better option because it had the advantage of being a new headset vs a 2 year old headset and VR tech moves pretty quickly. The Pico 4 is 430 euro and the Quest 2 is 300 euro which makes the Pico 4 a bit more of a tough sell, I also prefer the more fine tuned software of the Quest 2 but for pure PCVR the Pico 4 is the better one, but is it worth the 130 euro extra? Not sure, especially with the Quest 3 approaching.>>><<<I wasn&#39;t sure about the Pico 4 as I already had a Meta Quest 2 but about a month ago I decided to take the plunge and buy one, hey I&#39;m so glad I did as it&#39;s leaps and bounds better than my Quest 2 so much so I ended up selling it. The one thing I regret knowing what I know now is that I should of made the switch to Pico 4 sooner! Anyone on the fence and not sure don&#39;t be you won&#39;t be dissapointed 👍 Oh your light issue maybe as you say your face shape as I&#39;ve had no light coming through at all complete darkness, you can also get a small adaptor for a headset only cost £3 - $4 Ebay>>><<<Can I be a pin please 😊>>><<<If I wasn’t already planning on investing in PSVR2 then this definitely seems like something I’d be interested in>>><<<VR is fantastic! One thing I always tell people before they pull the trigger on any VR is to do research on what they want out of their headset and what experiences they want to get out of it. I&#39;m not sure how the Pico marketplace looks, but hopefully its comparable to the Meta Quest store and the application selection is decent. Thanks for your insight from your time using it!>>><<<Great video lono keep up the great work>>><<<Seems like a pretty legit unit for the price. If I didn&#39;t get motion sickness I&#39;d probably pull the trigger on it.>>><<<Actually didn&#39;t even think about the space aspect ans how itd benefit being truely wireless but your coverage of this device has been pretty tip top dude>>><<<What a bad unboxing video.>>><<<VR is great. I&#39;ve been playing since the original Rift! Horror games are my favorite. Horror just hits different in VR.>>><<<thanks for the full unboxing and showing me everything in the box.. I&#39;m just buying this headset now and wondering what I am going to get. You skipped nothing in the entire thing which I like. Conveniently this was uploaded 2 days ago as well.<br><br>My last headset was the rift s and I still have it but I am going wireless because I just love the idea of its portability and it&#39;s just the better headset upgrade.<br><br>Also, would like to tell you that walking dead saints and sinners is one of the only good horror VR games in my opinion. It&#39;s got some rough things to get it running perfectly but it&#39;s a great game once it works right. I am already big into steamVR and pcvr and also recommend you play a modded skyrimVR someday in your life. The absolute best VR game I&#39;ve ever played because well.. skyrim is my favorite game ever made.>>><<<yoooo Lono!!!<br>well well well... wasn&#39;t yah one of those turned out on VR, motion sickness whatever??? just kidding!!! LOL<br>Glad you found fun in the VR ecosystem, and is super sweet folks are reaching out to yah to check this stuff out... XD<br>For some, the barrier to get into VR is kinda huge I get it, plus some of the experiences available surely are sketchy, but when its good is actually awesome...<br>Hope you like playing around w/ it... For me, space themed games are the most fun, headsets usually feel like wearing a helmet, or breather mask, so, it gets immersive organically... <br>Cheers homie!! XD>>><<<Great video. The all in one aspect is great. My daughter was listening to the video as I’m making dinner. She said “You should get that” lol.>>><<<As my source for game play and gaming news I was excited to see you get the Pico 4!  <br><br>I am looking forward to seeing the performance of an all in one system as that makes a purchase much more straight forward.

Now seeing this video I am thinking of getting the pico 4 instead, I will say I am single and wow when I watched adult content on the meta quest 2 it actually blew me away, I am guessing the pico 4 can do the same and I can transfer movies onto the headset hard drive and watch it ? I was thinking of going for the meta quest 3 but the price, any help would be gladly appreciated thank you.>>><<<Here in Finland pico 4 it&#39;s 390€ 128 .

Is it something that gets updates or is it a neglected product?>>><<<Quest2😂>>><<<Can you play poker stars on pico4?>>><<<It is so hard now what headset to use when you start with VR. There is no perfect headset and all of them are super expensive. The announcement of the Quest 3 just made it harder. Personally I only care about RE4 when going standalone. 99% of the time would be used in PCVR. The only productivity I would wanna use is using a Whiteboard in VR which probably also works on PCVR.>>><<<Pro controllers are like add me to the headset.<br>Quest wins cause the pro-controllers>>><<<Why no image comparison?>>><<<Oculus software sucks my headset no longer connects to my phone and there 0 troubleshooting to help, temporarily quest didn’t allow me to update games once they update they just restarted. The oculus also won’t let me change internets almost all of the time then randomly the menus buttons work. Controller have extreme stick drift.

Tbh, that&#39;s the only reason why I keep my Facebook account open.>>><<<What is this flight simulator you flew the a320 in?>>><<<Terrible headset, I much preferred the Quest 2. On The Pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher (via link cable) Could see thousands of black dots in game around 3-4 meters away. The mic either picked up everything or nothing at all (VRC) Also I could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges. And the controllers weren&#39;t as comfy to hold, my middle fingers didn&#39;t line up with the side trigger. Iv just sent mine back.<br><br>Spend the extra for the Q2>>><<<Focused on entertainment?!

Because the head strap is horrible and the graphics are terrible on the quest two it’s so terribly blurry probably because of the horrid foveated rendering and not to mention the shitty ipd adjustment with only 3 fixed adjustments it’s a very lackluster headset honestly for the amount you pay. And lastly the controller rings are too thick so whenever your playing and you slam your hands together you’ll be absolutely shitting yourself while you slowly look and find out if you have broke the controllers. But apart from those issues which made the quest 2 unplayable for me it’s a extremely well made headset with lovely tracking>>><<<hello I have a question can we play with meta quest players?<br><br>I have a pico 4>>><<<Is their gorilla tag on pico 4?>>><<<is hitman vr in epic games launcher compatible with the pico 4??>>><<<pcvr still the best>>><<<👍🏼>>><<<Thx for excelent presentation.

I used to have a HTC Vive and have a bunch of VR games already on Steam. So having to connect the headset to my old PC to play these is a shame.

I think the pico controller is not doing great in positioning itsself>>><<<I already have the pico 4 but since my youtube feed is flooded with these comparisons and reviews, might as well watch some.<br>My workplace has quest2 and i have my own pico4, and 3 link, the 3 only temporarily anymore, and. The pico4 is just from another world if used standalone. The battery life though, need to use an external powerbank if planning to use for a longer time. If someone thinking of  getting a vr headset, i&#39;d recommend pico4 for mostly standalone, but if mostly pcvr, well pico neo 3 link, it&#39;s simply better. The quest2 is arguably better standalone headset than pico3link, but the pico 4 is so much better. And there are maybe reasons to use quest2 over pico4 if pcvr is the main focus, but in that case might as well go for pico3link.<br>The only reason i can think of to use quest2 now that there are options. The pro controllers. They cost 300$ on top of the headset, but seem to be so much better than, well any other standalone headset controllers. Hm. Owning the quest2 already is another reason to keep using it, it&#39;s by no means obsolete. For new users, and especially for a first time VR users, pico 4 is better, and i&#39;m not regretting getting it one bit.>>><<<the most important thing you didn&#39;t mention from what I see. The pico 4 has an exact IPD setting and better lens as well as image quality. In my case, the difference is huge because the oculus quest 2 did not fit my IPD because I am 71mm. Setting the right IPD is the most important thing in VR>>><<<Why did you not do a controller weight test->>><<<Don&#39;t know about Pico 4 but I do know for sure that Quest 2 is crap and overhyped for no legit reason since I bought it once (like a year+ ago) and it was bad, the 3D effect of Quest 2 was meh, the colors of the screen were off a bit (LCD) and the FOV was really limiting (even Quest 1 has better FOV than it), the controllers also weren&#39;t as comfortable compared to Quest 1&#39;s controllers which are perfect, hence why I sold my Quest 2 and went back to my old Quest 1.>>><<<Being a Spanish talker from south America...

I understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms. But let&#39;s say I want to play beat saber I can play it via PCVR but what about Lone echo?

I also can&#39;t get a clear picture unless I tilt the headset up slightly so all the pressure is on my forehead.  I had the same issue with the Vive Focus 3.  I think Mark Z has a similar head shape to me, which is why the Meta devices always seem to fit me better 😅.  I think having multiple fit-kits at launch is crucial for VR vendors.  Comfort is SO important.>>><<<Quest 2 software is better but for us living in china without vpn it&#39;s absolute bare bones as well everything is unusable 😒😒😒>>><<<Some people play the quest with regular strap. This guy just said if u add something to quest 2 it&#39;s heavier so pico is lighter... wtf this makes me think this comparison isn&#39;t objective. But when it comes to comparing the straps then he uses default quest 2 straps but not for the weight>>><<<So I have the Quest2 and will however buy the Pico4 as well and a friend of mine who didn&#39;t have a headset at all, is also going to get the Pico4. About the weight, to get the Quest2 balanced, you need a counterweight, which I use with the BoBoVR headstrap with battery. It works very well. But then the Pico4 has its advantage: it is lighter and already balanced from start. I saw another video from MRT where Sebastian demonstrated the BoboVR battery set for the Pico4 that you can attache above the original battery pack. It makes the headset heavier, but the way he said it is not a big deal, because the extra weight is on the back of your head. So far everything I see from the Pico4 is good news. I play most games as PCVR games with my Quest, so I can use the Pico4 as well for it.<br>But fitness I do also with the Quest and those are native to the Quest.... that&#39;s why I won&#39;t get rid of the Quest so soon. Besides it is always good to have a second machine as a backup.>>><<<Just get the pico neo 4 no debate unless you want to wait next year for the quest 3>>><<<what about 3d movies or 4k movies transferred from my hdd to the internal memory of both headsets???>>><<<can you run Google Earth VR on pico4?<br>the pico4 not support WebXR, right?<br>anyone has the US or EUR ROM to flash?>>><<<Isn&#39;t it possible to play the already bought Oculus games using PCVR?>>><<<i love my quest...big turn off for me about the pico is no mic plugin and no way to change the straps...Plus the company who owns tik tok bought them so if you thought facebook was spying on you imagine what these guys are doing>>><<<Why not both>>><<<I dont understand why headsets don&#39;t come with detatchable batteries. Apart from the obvious advantage for the user it would mean another accessory they could make money from.>>><<<You didn&#39;t cover privacy, which I would think is a VERY important issue. Facebook has a horrible track record, don&#39;t run for political office if you use an Meta device, Zuck will sell your data in a heartbeat. Bytedance, well, who knows, possibly they&#39;re sending everything you do back to China and sharing your usage habits with the CCP. I&#39;m not sure would be worse.<br><br>Is there an anonymous mode with the Pico 4 (or in PicoOS in general)? Or can you just make a disposable email account and sign up anonymously? Are Pico devices going to require a TikTok account? We already know that Facebook is FORCING all the Oculus Go users to connect their VR headsets to the Facebook accounts by the end of the year or have them disabled. The Pico 4 is well timed for all those casual users to jump ship... or is it actually jumping? It feels like Meta is making us walk the plank!>>><<<I&#39;m deciding on quest 2 or pico 4 just to play pc games on steam but if there&#39;s no plan on a pico 4 cable link then quest 2 is in favour..>>><<<So I&#39;m a little confused regarding pico linking to pc..I read you can only play pc games via air link with no cable,but on your video I see an option to link to pc via cable...so if there is cable link capability will it be USB or display port cable straight to graphics card..?..<br>Great video..>>><<<So if I plug the Pico 4 into my pc via USB C can I access the oculus store for games or only the steam store and are there many more games that are exclusive on the oculus store and not on Steam?>>><<<is it worth going from an index (only the headset) to the pico 4 for wirless and sharper immage?>>><<<For me, there is no Quest 2 &quot;or&quot; Pico 4. For me is Quest 2 &quot;and&quot; Pico 4 :)>>><<<Does the PICO have a video player similar to SKYBOX?>>><<<not even close enough of a jump in tech to warrant a purchase for existing Q2 owners..without even talking about the library ..and having to buy again ....huuuuuuuuge pass>>><<<I&#39;m waiting for the lynx r1 to drop for the reviews for deciding between the 3. Thing is, in a recent update, if you preorder the lynx r1 now, it&#39;ll arrive like in March even tho the first units start shipping in November...>>><<<Does this have better contrast ratio aka black levels than the quest 2?>>><<<For PCVR, how is the visual impression of the wireless VD streaming of Pico in comparison to quest? Especially far Details like trees in skyrim for example would be interesting to know :) and also of course how it is in comparison to a good pcvr headset like the g2 or so...<br><br>Great video btw, pretty high quality, I hope your channel will fly! :)>>><<<For productivity I thing better resolution allows for better reading experience and comfort allows for longer sessions>>><<<It was a nice review and much better than what anyone else had shown. It is massively disappointing that (i assume) Pico blocked full compassion videos to quest 2 (until now i guess), where i now do not trust previous vr reviewers.<br>Pico had made so many red flags... with no mention of pcvr, clearly not allowing quest vs pico reviews from early reviewers, the actual full weight, no aduio jack, the actual FOV, dropping the display port, poor inbuilt software/streaming, and how the motorized ipd works (which is a gimmick).<br><br>I have a quest 2 but also a pico4 pre-ordered just for the comfort for pcvr/watching movies and with higher resolution.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the pico4 is a clear winner but still a winner if trying to decide to waste(&amp;upgrade) 1500 euro on a quest pro (if that ends up being the price) or 400 euro on a pico 4 besides its downsides.<br><br><br>I still think Pico4 is the way to go this xmas if you dont mind the exclusives that will be missed from meta but since meta has the majority of the market... standalone on quest may end up getting better than expected.>>><<<another helpful video on the P4. Thank you. Did you notice any discomfort on your cheekbones or forehead from it?>>><<<Good short comparison that mentions all the important points. One small addition to the Pico OS/UI experience and you mentioning that Quest 2 has a two year headstart. That&#39;s not entirely correct. At release they will ship it with Pico OS 5 and already used earlier versions on older headsets like Neo 3. It&#39;s just a smaller software dev team compared to Meta but hopefully with the Bytedance acquisition and financial backing Pico will up their game.>>><<<Does running PCVR games via wi-fi virtual desktop run as well as a link cable direct to the computer like the quest 2?. Is the image quality going to be as good using the Pico 4 USB C cable compared to the direct link cable of the quest 2? Pros and cons?>>><<<I want to buy pico 4, but i dont know when or if it will be released in India.>>><<<I don&#39;t get the hype over the Pico. They copied the same design as the quest mixed with RPO, and knowing that the quest has been out for years should&#39;ve given tons of time to get their software and hardware in order before launch. The Pico should&#39;ve been better then the quest, but they just tried to make it slightly better with a color passthrough and a very small selection of games. I doubt this thing will catch on! 🤣🤣>>><<<any issues with light bleed on the side of the cushion of pico 4?>>><<<question - how weak is your neck :O  I have a halo strap with a battery and also had the default strap prior playing until the quest was flat but never had any neck strain :/>>><<<&quot;58MM IPD will crush your nose&quot;, Half the population has an IPD lower then 62mm, so there is going to be al lot of crushed noses then.>>><<<A bit odd that Virtual Desktop wasn&#39;t mentioned for PC streaming since for the Pico 4 it makes quite a difference compared to the current version of the streaming assistant. Of course it does cost a bit of money and it&#39;s a 3rd party app, but I do think it&#39;s worth a mention at least as long as the streaming assistant doesn&#39;t measure up to that yet.>>><<<Yeah, Americans helping China steal our R&amp;D>>><<<Both of these are flawed. If I didn&#39;t have a Quest 2 already, I think I would be waiting for the PSVR 2. That one destroys both of these because it&#39;s OLED.>>><<<How stable is guardian for big area?>>><<<Does pico 4 charge while playing pc games with cable?>>><<<i&#39;m playing pcvr only through steam. worth spending 430 on pico 4 to switch from quest 2?>>><<<What was that flight sim you were playing in the PCVR review? I have been looking for good vr alternatives other than vtol, xplane and msfs, what is the name of this game and is it built for VR?>>><<<This questions is answered vaguely at best.<br><br>Will I be able to play my Steam games, on the Pico 4, through a USB-C Cable?>>><<<I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ve seen anyone actually test the Pico running PCVR via USB-C, is it available yet?>>><<<I heard bad things about the controller position not be accurate on the pico 3>>><<<Neither because neither has displayport.>>><<<LIVE FAQ:<br><br>- CAN I STILL PLAY BEAT SABER ON THE PICO 4?<br>= Yes, via PCVR you can still play Beat Saber.<br><br>- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY AUTOMATIC IPD ADJUSTER<br>= I meant to say motorized IPD Adjuster.<br><br>- DO I HAVE A WEAK NECK?<br>= Try to play a combat flight simulator for 2 hours wit 800 grams on you head<br><br>- CAN THE PICO 4 IPD GO LOWER THAN 62MM?<br>= Yes it can go as low as 58 MM.

I got a $20 elite style strap off Amazon and my neck feel MUCH better now.

You just have to acknowledge a notification warning you that the lens edges might press against your nose and potentially cause discomfort at lower IPDs and larger noses. VR Essentials made a video demonstrating it a few days ago.>>><<<Great content!>>><<<Why open xr is not suuported by pico 4 ? Why pico4 controllers are not working on half of steam vr games?>>><<<[ PICO4GAMERS ]>>><<<I signed up for the jmancurly giveaway for the PECO 4>>><<<Looks like a rip-off of the Quest 2, similar ui layout, similar features, identical quick settings menu, ect.>>><<<pico 4>>><<<Here before boom>>><<<Someone know anything about the MRC (mixed reality capture) I whant to use it but dont know how>>><<<please make medal of honor above and beyond come to Pico store as standalone>>><<<Pico4 is awesome. Kudos to the team behind this fantastic hardware at this price range. 🤍🤍🤍 When Chillout VR standalone comes out, I&#39;m going to buy two more for my parents.

Показали рекламу и на этом все.....>>><<<China is currently selling the Enterprise as a the Pico 4 Pro.. Is there anything stopping me from buying one as a Consumer for the Eye and Facial Tracking for PC VR?>>><<<Pico please add beat Saber to the pico store>>><<<Are you releasing this in the US yet?>>><<<Man I want this>>><<<what is the price ?>>><<<PICO, if you were smart, you would release this product to the public to gain more market, since in META they were calmer knowing that this product was only for companies, and they are increasing the sales of their meta quest pro for ONE reason, you can use their headset for gaming or business,Anyone can buy it, while this one cannot be bought by anyone who wants to play games on it.>>><<<👏👏👏👏>>><<<I would definitely buy this over Quest Pro if released for sale to the public. <br>Do it Pico🙏>>><<<When exactly? Cost?>>><<<Finally>>><<<Love this review, i was kinda regreting buying the pico 4 but now i know what it can do>>><<<my friend gave me a pico 4 gaming headset.>>><<<Best all round IMO ,  Pankake lenses are game changers for clarity,    Light weight, but has some aspects that need adressing,  Thge Face shield needs replacing with AMVR but thats cheap.   the audio ports are nowhere near your ears (currently designing and 3d printing ear enclosured for it  &quot;Picoear&quot;  available soon.>>><<<wow it&#39;s cheap 429 for a headset?!>>><<<This is a bad buy. its owned by the CCP ByteDance. ByteDance is a unsafe ompany to buy things.>>><<<Made it back>>><<<i have noticed there are a lot of Dutch VR content creators, quite cool imo>>><<<Pico is like Slim Quest2.>>><<<Awesome video<br>But please lose the music>>><<<How does the recline mode works?  Does it allow me to play VR while laying down in bed?>>><<<I bought one and returned a day later. Dealbraker for me is that the screen door effect is VERY noticeable for me. I come from a Rift CV1, that has HALF the resolution, and yes screen door effect is less on the Pico 4 but it was still there and different. Also, playing with the stream assistant and USB-C cable a lot of stuff wasn&#39;t working. Took me 3 hours to get sound. Hand gestures (yes the controllers have capacitive buttons and sticks) didn&#39;t work in Half Life Alix. The tracking was a lot worse than the CV1. So having a new headset, that is for me less fun than a 7 year old headset just doesn&#39;t cut it for me...>>><<<how is it comparing to oculus quest 2?>>><<<Ooo hij is nederlandstalig>>><<<Thank you, Mr Laubox 🌈>>><<<Can you charge while playing?>>><<<Its insane how much and how to the detail they had copy the Oculus Quest product. Its pretty disgusting..>>><<<Cool headset, but what about custom lenses?>>><<<Great review thanks 👍>>><<<After years of playing oculus Rift (or at least own it,) I decided to give Pico 4 a try. My experience is very subjective and I&#39;ve only had the rift to compare to. Personally it wasn&#39;t as amazing as I imagined it. My oculus rift imo has the best strap ever created and It almost feels like I&#39;m not wearing a headset after a few hours. Pico 4 however felt stiff in the cushioning and it also revealed that I&#39;m disfigured, because no matter what I did, the headset kept putting pressure on the top of my nose bone to the point it began to hurt. If I manage to put it in a spot where it doesn&#39;t hurt, I lost all clarity because it was too high up... Coming from regular gaming with 144hz and Oculus tethered experience, wireless is not the way to go for me I think. Too much latency and stutters, after I realized I had to buy a new router just to be able to access wireless. Unless its as fluid as tethered I can&#39;t do it. I&#39;m a PCVR only fella and I have no experience with other headsets apart from rift but I also felt that the clarity was only in the center of the screen and completely blurry at the edges. Heard its not uncommon but never really experienced that on my rift (granted it was all pretty much blurry so might just not seen the difference XD). Looking down at my body in bonelabs it was just blur. No crisp boobs to play with DX>>><<<We have quest 1,2 and this pico 4. Honesty speaking this Pico 4 is so far the best wireless headset we have tested. Much lighter in weight, much better resolution and tracking accuracy. Very nicely comfortable>>><<<The longer I wait to buy a VR headset, the happier i am. I&#39;m not ready to jump in yet, it seems like there&#39;s still another level of experience vs pricing to be ironed out before I do. But with headset like this, were definitively getting closer.>>><<<The ui looks identical to the quest ui>>><<<you are gorgeous>>><<<My neck really needs this one💕>>><<<Jesus Christ loves you>>><<<Would it make sense to get this it one didn’t have a gaming PC? I have a PS5 but really want to move into a VR headset without the need of PC games. Would this be recommended still or should I look at the PS VR or Meta 2?>>><<<very easy immediate &quot;no&quot; just by virtue of not being a halo-style headset>>><<<Definitely an exciting headset!>>><<<My question is :<br>Why is there no standalone headset with expandable storage? Seems like the nect quality of life thing any company could do... and it wouldnt even cost them a lot. Also it&#39;d be easy to implement. <br>But i understand these companies just want your money so it probably wont happen that soon...>>><<<So the quest 2 needs the Oculus software installed on windows in order to run PC VR  games on the oculus quest 2. The Oculus Software can&#39;t be installed on Linux and without it installed the headset can&#39;t be used except for sideloading games. Does the Pico 4 offer support for Linux cause the are those of us that would love to play PC VR titles on the Linux SteamVR?>>><<<The PC requirement is harsh.>>><<<can you please show how good it is with Full Body tracking on VRchat?>>><<<1200 pixel per degree?  Isn&#39;t that better than human eyes?  The FOV must be really small.>>><<<Ill stick to my Quest 2>>><<<I&#39;m waiting to see what the Quest 3 will be like.>>><<<Hi bud, great review, clear and well presented. You earned a sub :) I look forward to the revisit, as I am sorely tempted... Question if you&#39;re reading this - did you play Beat Saber and is it comfy - and do you play with a &#39;claw grip&#39; or just normal hilt grip - and what was your impressions? Billions of Beat Saber players need to know! :D>>><<<Is it Android? I wonder if you could sideload a quest exclusive 🤔>>><<<boring vid.>>><<<Feels like auxiliary ports are becoming a thing of the past. Which is sad, cause I&#39;m lucky to even remember to charge my phone 😑>>><<<I just bought the quest pro because I wanted something with better weight balance for pcvr. Had I known about this I probably would have gotten it instead! I&#39;m impressed with its library so far! But I guess I want to wait anyway to see what valve and HTC have coming up. I really want a standalone steamvr headset. No more walled gardens please.>>><<<Only downside I see with this is not being able to access oculus library. Its a bummer because This headset looks and sounds amazing (a much lighter headset sounds like a godsend) but having all my games on oculus, theres no way im rebuying them all for pico.>>><<<Do I have to rebuy all the games I already bought in my quest 2?>>><<<So, this or Meta Quest 2? <br>Which is better and why?>>><<<Very good work breaking down everything on the headset. Very helpful 👍>>><<<Does it cause motion sickness?>>><<<Can I play steamvr beat saber over wifi with this?>>><<<Meta is falling asleep, especially after their announcement of Quest Pro. This is definitely a worthy purchase.>>><<<Is the picture quality better on hardwire pcvr?>>><<<If it doesn’t have population one, I’m out.>>><<<it looks like a rip-off of the Meta Quest, even the software UI.....>>><<<If only I could transfer my games from Quest. I&#39;ve already bought a ton of them. :(>>><<<Did you experience any latency using bluetooth headsets? Like in that rhythm game you played? People think bluetooth always has bad latency, but it can be pretty good depending on the device... For instance on the steam deck it&#39;s perfectly fine, can barely detect latency, while on the quest 2 it&#39;s absolute dogshit and unusable.>>><<<Hello, as first VR headset which one should I consider ? Pico4 or quest2 (can’t wait for quest 3 😅)<br>Mostly for standalone VR (old gtx 970…)>>><<<ruins my hair no buy.>>><<<Hi laubox, can you please confirm if Echo Vr (Arena) is playable on the Pico 4 via Virtual Desktop please, thankyou very much>>><<<ahh... we are waiting for them to get cheaper, NOT MORE FUCKING EXPENSIVE THAN QUEST 2.....<br><br><br><br>and I just learned the news about Quest Pro costing 1500 $ xDD   fucking insanity is what this is ...  my salary is as poor as it was last year so fuck your overpriced products ....>>><<<Interesting, thanks 👍>>><<<Will SideQuest games be compatible with these??>>><<<Its definitely the best piece of ccp spyware (the company that makes it is owned by chinese govt)>>><<<I already have a Pico 8.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=521">8:41</a> what game is this?>>><<<Tethered PCVR is affected by battery? I mean, if the battery eventually dies, can I still used it with my cable?>>><<<If you want to us a wire to stream games is that an option?<br>It has no Displayport cable only usb 3 and as far as i know, usb 3 can not work like a Display Port cable.<br>I play VR for 5+ hours and need the headset to be powered.<br>Could i play using WIFI and have the cable connected to charge the headset?>>><<<You said absolutely nothing about the tracking fidelity, arguably the most important aspect of any headset...<br><br>Bro.>>><<<If i wouldn&#39;t have bought my Quest 2 and all my games on Oculus I think I would have bought this one instead.>>><<<I don’t know… I’m still fine with my reverb G2. Seems like a lot of the stuff this offers the G2 already does. Will probably upgrade once an 8K headset comes out. Using for DCS and IL-2>>><<<The headset and hardware seems amazing ! But why does the software, setup, design, menus and even the box have to look so similar to the Quest ? Even the activity ring is copy and paste from the apple watch activity ring. it just give the impression that its just a oculus clone from a Chinese company. Don&#39;t they have designer of their own ?>>><<<Price same as oculus 2 so better buy oculus>>><<<This quality and editing is honestly unbelievable for such a small channel.

It made it more approachable for consumers that want some security with their purchase, knowing so many things were interchangeable.<br><br>I just really don&#39;t wanna find out that after, say, 1,000 hours of use the ratchet breaks on everyone&#39;s headstrap, with them all now out of warranty, forcing people to just junk the thing.

It seems like the UI was directly replicated from META>>><<<This is oculus on steroids>>><<<this looks soooooo cool, I&#39;m super excited to get a refresh on the quest 2. This one has 1200 PPI and the quest 2 has 773 so it&#39;ll be clearer, super excited to see comparisons between those 2.<br><br>I just hope their version on Link / AirLink is as good if not better. Would be nice if it could handle more bandwidth while decoding>>><<<what&#39;s the game at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=607">10:07</a> ? looks cool>>><<<Maybe I&#39;ll get one when it lowers in price. For now Im good with my quest 2 as I have quite a few games on it.>>><<<wait, the pico 4 allows you to connect to PC with cable?!<br>Everyone on every platform said that that&#39;s not possible, even the picoxr website said to connect via wifi-6>>><<<if it was available in the us already I would have already made an order tbh, the quest 2 is nice and all being lighter than an index but still gets heavy after a while, it&#39;d be nice having a headset that&#39;s much lighter.>>><<<Wtf is a euro? Not very considerate not translating what a euro is considering most US channels are considerate enough to also state international measurements, celsius, etc.>>><<<Nah, I&#39;ll take a cabled model.>>><<<Laubox is my favourite VR content creator. Top notch quality like always 👍>>><<<hp: you need 0 accaount>>><<<While the promising display, better weight distribution, magnetic facial interface and precision ipd adjuster is a leap forward, the battery and sound controller being part of the headstrap is a massive turn off for me and prevents anyone from making an aftermarket/replacement headstrap if they don&#39;t like the default one.>>><<<It&#39;s just like Quest 2 in another headset>>><<<No headphone jack is kind of a bag of shit. How the hell are you supposed to charger it and use headphones at the same time.>>><<<Damn dude you don&#39;t have to smolder that hard with the headset on, geeze...<br>You out here with your razor sharp jawline and those perfectly pouty lips...>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=613">10:13</a> What game is that?>>><<<the graphics look the same. so whats the point>>><<<Laubox? the friend with sp4zie laubox? :O<br>I&#39;ve randomly found you looking for reviews of the pico 4 :D>>><<<Looks great! Glad to see competition in the wireless headset marketplace>>><<<your bass audio is a little louddd>>><<<I really hope that this is an honest review. When quest 2 came out there was so much crap spoken about it that it was an anti-climax when I got hold of it. I like to immerse myself in VR, especially films. Q2 is shit for watching them. The headset is too heavy. If you attach an external battery as a counterweight, you cannot sit down and relax without risking whiplash. So I have just pre-ordered this Pico 4 and hope I can finally catch up with all the films I have that need to be watched on a big screen. Completely ignoring the fact that it will record everything it sees and send it back to its Chinese masters.>>><<<Very informative review. Thank you. I will be picking one of these up. I Bought a Quest 2 for $300. FB....or...&quot;Meta&quot; sucks. I bought the $80 Quest cable and a Wifi 6 router and it still wouldn&#39;t connect. I quickly sold my Quest to someone at work for $50 and then got a Pimax. Do you know how much of an object that a Pimax puts on your face?? Its a massive object for a face to be having on it. With a Pico I can finally get back to playing Beat Sa...I mean BoneWorks.>>><<<If it has a separate 3.5mm jack it would be amazing.<br>Not being able to charge and listen (like in a sit down movie setting) is a pretty big detractor.<br>And since latency is so important bluetooth for most things is off the table.>>><<<More competition and more choices! Meta quest, pro, and apple VR headsets will cost beyond most people&#39;s budget, so Pico’s quality-price ratio is a very attractive choice>>><<<More competition and more choices! Meta quest, pro, and apple VR headsets will cost beyond most people&#39;s budget, so Pico’s quality-price ratio is a very attractive choice>>><<<Do the controllers not come with straps?>>><<<FOV seems pretty crappy though, right?>>><<<Just noticed how ready player one this looks lol>>><<<No replaceable strap is a red flag.>>><<<Currently in the middle of selling my Quest 2 to purchase this really can’t wait for this looks unreal>>><<<that FOV doe.   don&#39;t underestimate the power of FOV to drive immersion.  105 in 2022.  womp womp.  i get that it keeps it small and light, but meh.  we need to get 180+!>>><<<I have to admit the Pico is extremely compelling for me. I would consider myself to be a very casual VR player. I currently have an Odyssey 2 which I pick up from time to time. I tried the Quest 2 but returned it since the stock strap was so bad (I know I know - many different options out there, etc but as I mentioned I&#39;m very casual and just really couldn&#39;t be bothered). The fact that this seems so much lighter and display being better is extremely compelling. Hope they make a US release possible.>>><<<How is this headset for people with a high nose bridge ? does it sit on the nose and cause discomfort or can you adjust the straps to avoid it ?>>><<<As with all headsets it comes down to the apps and software. Same here. Seems like a great Q2 or ever Q2+ clone. Is it enough?>>><<<Is there a web browser on the Pico4? And can it be used with pass-through?>>><<<Damn it&#39;s looking good but buying same games again, no>>><<<Looks too good to be true, hmm>>><<<I’m enjoying my Quest 2 for now, but I will probably get something like that next year when cost comes down and tech advances another notch.<br>Great video 👍🏼>>><<<This could easily replace my quest. I hate everything about facebook/meta giant and want to be as far as them as i can. Seems like this could be the answer.>>><<<Does this HMD for setup need any kind of App store application on your phone for the setup?>>><<<Man if only I hadn’t spent a bunch on quest games I would buy this. Even though my games have been cross buy I can probably make it work through link somehow.>>><<<Literally the same thing to quest 2 but more expensive. Good review tho I would trade this in with my quest 2 if I had a pc>>><<<Looks good but I&#39;ll wait to see what kind of spying and info collection is tied to it.>>><<<Please make a video on Pico 4 WIRED, USB cable experience. Thank you!!!>>><<<WOOOOWWWWW. I wish I would of waited for this and get this instead. I&#39;ve got Quest 2 not so long ago.>>><<<Why does it function so much like a quest 2?? That’s so odd…>>><<<Except they excluded anyone under 62 IPD… no thanks - terrible>>><<<can you wear glasses with them thas a deal breaker for me>>><<<Looks horrible.>>><<<Dead to me. No displayport and I am MAD. Would have been the best pcvr headset by MILESSSSSSS if it had displayport>>><<<I tought PICO 4 didn&#39;t have a cable for PCVR? Is this the case?>>><<<Not everyone has short hair. Alot of people wear buns and these straps make it impossible to sit comfortably on your head with long hair in general>>><<<You can&#39;t connect it via cable>>><<<Pico 4<br><br>Advantages:<br><br>SoC-This product got a better SoC than the meta quest 2, its the same SoC but overclocked and got a better cooling soultion. There is no information about the GPU specs of the SoC, but because there is better a cooling they logicly overclocked it. and there is 8gb of ram with speed of 2133 mhz vs 6gb of ram with [speed of Meta won&#39;t tell us cause they obviously sucks at it] mhz of quest 2<br>SCREEN- The screen is better and there is no &quot;screen door effect&quot; anymore due to 2160x2160 pixel resolution per eye vs 1,832 x 1,920 pixel resolution of the quest 2. The screen is 72 HZ and 90 HZ, which losing to quest 2 that got 72 Hz, 90Hz and120 Hz.<br>DESIGN- The design of the Pico 4 is slimmer and sexier, ELITE STRAP is built in (costs 60$ for the quest 2 XD), The vibration motor of the the controllers makes huge diffrence between the two. <br>COMFORT- the most important for the mainstream user is the COMFORT, because the ELITE STRAP included, there is 300 grams in front and 300 grams in the back of the headset, so no more discomfort due to inbalance in mass.<br>PC GAMING- Due to no official support of cable, they got a WIFI streaming software, its not the best and to fix it you will need to buy virtual desktop, due to a better wifi module and antena the bandwith and the most important the ping(the time it takes to the pc send the video information to the headset) is awesome and now a wifi router in the other room will work perfect.<br>PASSTHROUGH- one more con of the pico 4 is the AR camera/passthrough camera it is a 16MP RGB(colored) camera which is better then the Black and White one on the quest 2 and got more pixels.<br><br>Disadvantages:<br><br>There is no disadvantages. Just kidding xD:<br><br>GAMES- There is a no games much games to play, but its better than when the quest 1 launched, so while people developing new games u will have time to finish the current games (only if u arent living in VR and playing only 10 hours a week).<br>GAME SERVER- In the last pico&#39;s VR headset people had a problem with the ping/ latency because most of the servers were located in China- mother of the greater son in the pico family Little Pico 4.<br>COMUNITY- Most of the COMUNITY are communists (Chinese) at the moment, LETS FIX IT!<br>PC GAMING- No cable support at the moment... CYKA BLYAT!!!>>><<<Boku 4 Piko>>><<<1) basically a copycat of meta<br>2) no content<br>3) high risk of company being blocked in the US<br><br>no.thanks>>><<<Doesn&#39;t touch my 3 year old index so.....no?>>><<<It sounds cool but I already have a quest and a lot of games on it so if I get this it would just do pretty much the same thing but I would have to buy more games for it>>><<<Fuck. This is really good. <br>Now I regret buying my quest 2>>><<<PSVR 2 will be the leading VR headset>>><<<Minimum IPD 62? That sucks...>>><<<is it better than quest 2?>>><<<this head set is not good at all thanks for reading this>>><<<does this have hand tracking?>>><<<If there werent rumors of Valve working on a standalone I would consider this one. I am surprised there arent any lawsuits going around with how similar the UI is to the Quests lol>>><<<clone of the oculus quest 2  , didn&#39;t impressed me at all.>>><<<First VR headset that allows wireless PCVR gaming without a Facebook account? I’m interested. I have the oculus quest 2 but I also happen to work in China and It doesn’t allow me to connect to the internet. Cannot update it anymore.>>><<<In Chile pico,  is pene>>><<<I&#39;m just waiting for prescription lens for this then I&#39;m buying>>><<<Pichula 4>>><<<I’ll rather let Americans steal my data so no thanks>>><<<👍>>><<<PCVR q. USB-C Native display port or codec style like oculus>>><<<Shame the standalone doesn&#39;t have VRChat.>>><<<shame they didnt add 3.5 jack instead of front passthrough camera nice review tho>>><<<Do I get pico 4 this Christmas or get psvr2>>><<<i like to lay down watching movies, can you lay down comfortably with the headset?>>><<<Honestly looks nice, I didn’t know that steam had their own fr section. I though only the valve stuff could use it.>>><<<That UI is such an oculus ripoff>>><<<no 3.5 mm jack , no oled panels , no 120 Hz refresh rate , if the straps break - then it&#39;s 500 euro brick , i am sticking with quest 2 and will wait for project cambria - hopefully facebook  &#39;d deliver which this cannot ! May be pico 5 will be better ! Still the video is very informative - thanks>>><<<I&#39;m also guessing it&#39;s running android just a different more heavily modified version of it fun fact the quest does the same actually>>><<<This is probably the thing the quest should have been the slimness is really something>>><<<I never thought they&#39;d get to ready player one type slimness with the pico headset but I&#39;m surprised that they did🙀>>><<<Can you play steamvr through a usb c cabel with the pico 4?>>><<<Can we order these from the uk in the us?>>><<<Wow!! Great review!!! I would like to know if the headset comes with a charge cable and how long it is. Can you play PCVR while It&#39;s charging?? Can you browse your PC like using the headset as a monitor? (like you can with the Oculus Rift and Rift S) One more thing! Do you need to be signed in to a Pico account to do PCVR (through Steam)?? TY &amp; Subscribed!!!>>><<<The UI looks so similar to oculus 👀>>><<<I wonder how the latency is with PC-VR.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVo8ii32Gc">https://youtu.be/FwVo8ii32Gc</a>>>><<<What is the city-building game at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=521">8:41</a>?>>><<<If any of you are buying your first headset and have a good PC.. Play Half-Life: Alyx.. It&#39;s incredible.>>><<<I thought Pico 4 wasn&#39;t going to support PCVR as they wanted to focus on standalone and Pico 3 Link was there for PCVR>>><<<All good except the undetacheble headstrap.. i will wait untill 3d party accessories are released>>><<<Odd that they chose an IPD range of 62-72, this seems to be in the higher range and would likely make it uncomfortable for those in the lower range. Surely it would have made more sense to make it +/- 5 either side of the average IPD? Or maybe they did some research and found that people interested in VR would likely have a wider IPD for some reason?>>><<<sick!>>><<<The design of this looks good.<br>The weight of a headset is not as important as weight distribution, and this looks like the load is split fairly evenly between back and front, so will feel far more comfortable.<br>Also, same price as Quest, with Pro-strap included.>>><<<Use this device if you want all your personal data and telemetrics held by the Fascist CCP in the PRC>>><<<It is only 3Dof and not 6Dof so I guess it&#39;s not a worthy upgrade from my Samsung oddysey.>>><<<This is a very good review man. Well done>>><<<How is the image quality over USB compared to your Pico Neo 3 Link?>>><<<What can you say about new pancake lens used in Pico 4 comparing to Meta Quest 2?>>><<<The reason I stop playing quest 2 is usually due to heat on my face. Does the pico run cooler?>>><<<I know Beat Saber is exclusive to the Quest, but is there any game similar to Beat Saber on the Pico? Also, what is are the best games on it now, in your opinion...?>>><<<Great video, but a quite important thing for me is, that I wear glasses, is there a chance of scratching the lenses or can you get prescription lenses like you can on the occulus?>>><<<Hi. Is it possible to browse internet or read e-book? Is the text clear enough for long time reading / working with documents?>>><<<Any system run by China is suspect. Will your data be compromised? Are you supporting their fascist dictatorship by buying it? Are profits being put into their military machine? Would you be concerned about manufacturing without proper environmental concerns? What about the Uighur genocide?>>><<<IPD  62 to 72, not for me ,i have an IPD 59.5 !😪😪>>><<<Nice ive been looking to rid myself of Zucherberg.>>><<<What is the cost?>>><<<Wow. I&#39;d love to review this one too. Looks really cool!>>><<<This looks much more comfortable than the quest 3. Wish it was available in the US>>><<<the headset literally looks like one straight from the ready player one movie.>>><<<Ah, since the FOV is almost 17% more, the extra resolution is more spread out than the Q2, so probably look about the same as far as pixels.  Seems movies would look similar, so probably still SDE like the Q2.>>><<<How is the image compared to the Q2?  Q2 movie quality still has some screen door.>>><<<The market is not big enough to fragment with another app ecosystem market.  Devs will make even less money and it could fail.  Unless the market grows a lot.>>><<<Thanks for the video! The price and features seem to be balanced quite well. Judging from the video, Pico is light years ahead of my ancient PSVR, so I guess I&#39;m due for an upgrade soon.>>><<<What a good review, I want to buy a new vr headset but i dont know if my gaming rig (3070+R7 5800X) can handle without issues and good framerate the 4k+ resolution of the Pico 4, I dont want to experience any motion sickness thats why im doubting between Quest 2 (a bit lower res) or Pico 4>>><<<can you confirm we can use pico 4 in pcvr mode with the usb c ?>>><<<hello, I mainly play in the DCS world ... I was thinking of buying HP Reverb versus 2  but now, in terms of parameters, is Pico 4 better than HP Reverb v2?any advice or should I wait for Meta and the Apple?>>><<<NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I&#39;ve an IPD of 59-60 :(  I was so looking forward to this too.>>><<<How does this compare with the Valve VR offering?>>><<<Looks interesting. I&#39;m still on the quest 1 and I thought of buying the Pico 4 pro so I get eye tracking but I&#39;ll see if its worth it>>><<<I&#39;d never trust it, you think Facebook is bad for data?<br>ALL Chinese companies are required by Chinese law to share all data with the communist party. <br><br>You seriously want a device in your house with cameras, microphones and contains all your personal account details that gives all that to the CCP?<br><br>F&#39;k that!>>><<<No tv in your apartment.... Mmmm>>><<<The resolution is higher than the quest 2 then right? Aren&#39;t they using a similar power chip? So would the games perform worse then?>>><<<Finna be iphone v android>>><<<Does the pico vr 4 include all vr games  just as in quest 2? Because i have a favorite game on quest 2 which is echo arena, i just want someone to confirm if its still available for any vr headsets or its only exlcusive to the quest 2.>>><<<The best vr gaming is the hp reverb g2.>>><<<Thanks for the review. How is the image quality in games compared to HP Reverb?>>><<<TupacVR?>>><<<Damn this headset has copyright infringement on the Quest 2 written all over it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it looks amazing but they took too many inspirations. I&#39;d say it looks and feels like a Quest 3 both in hardware and software.>>><<<I know they aren&#39;t selling in the US, but is there any localization locks if I still get my hands on one?>>><<<Is it a PC vr?>>><<<No Display port is a deal breaker, as I only use pcvr racing sims and MSFS.  Streaming that, without massive compression and quality loss?! Lol, no way we&#39;re there yet>>><<<Is this a significant upgrade over the Rift S? I&#39;ve had my Rift S since 2019 and have been waiting for something that is better than the hp reverb g2 when it comes to image resolution [and that isn&#39;t as expensive as the varjo aero].>>><<<Wish this came before the quest 2. Would have got this instead. Love how small it is.  Also what flying game was he playing in the video?>>><<<Very good video!>>><<<great vid, when will the headset be available to buy?>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=457">7:37</a> I like that the theater model looks a bit like a cross between an IMAX theater and the largest Dolby Cinema theater that I go to sometimes out here in Arizona. Feels familiar in the best way.>>><<<It&#39;s literally a slightly worse quest>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=585">9:45</a> Can you use the pico neo 4 with a USB 3.0 cable? If so, please let me know. Since I don&#39;t think the wifi in my room is solid enough to use the wireless streaming. I&#39;ve been trying to find an answer to this question for ages but haven&#39;t been able to find it anywhere. One thing I also would like to know is if the headset charges or maintains charge if you use it wired. I would much appreciate it if you could give me the answers to these questions!>>><<<do you need a pc for this ?>>><<<Pico company are on top class!>>><<<Eh I get that it has a wider FOV and a bit higher RES but those controllers look so awful and in my opinion the Q2 is the much better deal. It&#39;s a shame it&#39;s backed by a company that does not have our best interest in mind.>>><<<If this plays bonelab as seamless as it plays on the quest version on the quest 2, then it would be a consideration.<br>That&#39;s because if bonelab is seamless, boneworks and other steamvr titles would be better than on quest 2.<br>If it doesn&#39;t...then i&#39;ll stick with quest2...>>><<<what about people who wear glasses?? Any information on that?>>><<<Very interesting video, I am interested in buying a headset like this one as my first VR headset, although what I cannot find is what PC specs do I need for a smooth experience? I currently have a ryzen 7 2700 and a rtx 2060 with 32gb of ram. Is that enough to play Pc vr games smoothly?>>><<<I really don’t see the point of VR>>><<<how do you get games on there ? same way as quest 2, via creditcard?>>><<<One thing that&#39;s important to me that you didn&#39;t mention:  Can the Headset be used indefinitely as a PCVR Headset?<br><br>I had a friend&#39;s Quest 2 over for a weekend and that still used up it&#39;s battery while I was flying in DCS world...  Giving me only about 4 hours before I would be forced (by the hardware) to take a break.  Considering that some sessions with my wingman have been 10 or even 12 hours...   that&#39;s a big issue for me.<br><br>I currently have a Rift CV1,  but with the changes that they&#39;re pushing next year where you&#39;re forced to log in with a Facebook account,  I&#39;m gonna have to switch to a different ecosystem...>>><<<same cpu spec of quest 2 from 2020 is an auto no for me. will wait for quest 3 next year.>>><<<One question, where the fuck is the headphone jack like seriously>>><<<Can anyone tell me the average size of a game and how much is available? I think that the 128GB version should be enough for me. with games taking an average of 10gb that would be at least 10 games installed, so that&#39;s probably more than enough. I&#39;ll probably use it more for PC streaming if I get one.>>><<<These YouTubers are more and more robotic by the day. I absolutely can’t stand these bot reviews>>><<<Hi,will it run usb c pen drives through the usb c port ? Can it recognise files and movies when you plug one in ??>>><<<Very excited about this headset! It seems like the quest competition we were hoping for! <br>Would love to get my hands on this some time maybe for a review myself, awesome video man! <br>Erg goed gedaan voor je eerste Hardware video! :3>>><<<I&#39;d love to get this headset from an official store and not a scalper once it&#39;s available.>>><<<side heatstraps look uncomfortable to me seems if people have a wide head it wont be good>>><<<Would love to know if capacitive touch shows up in SteamVR&#39;s &quot;test controllers&quot; UI.<br>Haven&#39;t seen concrete evidence touch input will work with PC yet and it is a make or break for my usecases. <br><br>Great video.>>><<<“Was gifted it early” take some of the personal opinions of it with a side of salt>>><<<Little concerned about something... Does controllers have any kind of strap ? Didn&#39;t see them in video.>>><<<Could you somehow be able to play Golf+ with this headset? It&#39;s the game I want. So would make my decision if I buy this one or the meta quest 2>>><<<Looks nice, only thing I wouldn&#39;t like would be the strap and with the battery being in the back it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ll be able to get third-party straps.>>><<<I just don’t want to buy my games over again…..>>><<<I have a question! 😮😱💀<br><br>Those controllers of PICO Neo 4 are Touch controllers like Quest 2?>>><<<Why is this a oculus rip off ui and everything>>><<<As a diehard quest fan boy I gotta say. This definitely looks impressive. I hope it gets enough software to compete.>>><<<Can’t wait for the USA release, I was about to buy a quest 2 but this headset is more fitting for me>>><<<is sideloading possible ? what about sideloading Beat saber from Quest 2 ? will it work, or does it depend on Oculus API ?>>><<<So where the hell can I buy it in the US>>><<<Watching you struggle with that arrow was painful. You hold it on rhe end not the middle lmao.>>><<<so PC VR works with cable?>>><<<For something that comes from China this is actually extremely impressive>>><<<okay but how do you get your oculus game on your pico 4 ????>>><<<How is the microphone?

Did someone told you that you looks alike James Marsden from the Xmen movies ? ^^<br>Have a nice day &quot;Scott&quot; 🥰>>><<<looks ok but don&#39;t think the tech is a big enough of a jump for existing Q2 owners to spend all that cash on 😁>>><<<im so sick of my quest 2 <br>I want this so bad lol>>><<<If my games are crossplay with thia new headset im definetly buying this one>>><<<Bit more in depth specs coverage would have bin nice...but thx anyway>>><<<Same price as quest 2 and looks cheaper..

I’ll stick with fb thanks , don’t care how good their head set is Ill never trust tik tok>>><<<If we have virtual desktop for example for quest 2 will we need to buy it again ?>>><<<who cares about all these head sets? Where are the games? Other then half life alyx they are trash.>>><<<nah i aint gonna listen to a sponsored review, il wait for people who buy it like everyone else when its available>>><<<The Pico also lets you browse the local network, so if you have a Windows file share on your computer, you can connect to that and directly stream a 3D or normal movie to the headset over wifi. I find this pretty handy, just sit on the couch and browse to your file and play. I have the Pico 3 Link, but same software. The built-in video player is pretty capable which was a very pleasant surprise for me. I&#39;m also going to have to try Virtual Desktop for this when it comes out.>>><<<Hi could you tell us, how is controllers Haptics please ?<br>Better than WMR ?

I&#39;m sold.>>><<<So cool😲❤😎👍>>><<<Wait, how do you get hands in MS flight simulator?>>><<<Does it have bonelab?>>><<<It looks cute on you>>><<<I&#39;m so lost right now, I wanna get my first VR Headset and seeing what Pico offers it makes it look like it&#39;s the one I should get, but the fact that Quest 2 has more games, more apps, and everything more polished just makes me believe Quest 2 it&#39;s better. I don&#39;t know what to do hahaha, I guess I&#39;ll wait for more reviews on this new Pico 4 headset.<br><br>Thank you for this in-depth review touching all points about the Pico 4. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing more videos about this headset.>>><<<How about the blurry ness &amp; screen door effects in environment &amp; movies?>>><<<Hell no who would actually get this, get the meta quest 2 its cheaper, plus no pc, same graphics and better graphics card then the cheap-ish pico. This is literally a cheap knockoff of the index, &quot;this is so light it feels cheap, but its not cheap cuz of all of the tech&quot;? No, it has cheap plastic and cheap tech its just overpriced, thats why its so light and i bet if you hit it or dropped it once its toast>>><<<this headset, reminds me of the headset that wade watts uses in Ready player one>>><<<is it possible to use DeoVR or Skybox vr player for watching movies? Can you watch movies straight from your pc harddrive? how long does the battery last, is it enough to watch a whole movie?>>><<<Can you play beat saber in this vr?>>><<<Keep in mind, this is only even remotely worth it for pcvr tbh. There are very very few games available. Roughly 100, the quest store (including app lab) has over 1,000>>><<<This seems like it’s gonna be a really good headset especially considering the face that the new quest isn’t gonna be a gaming headset and gonna be $1500>>><<<That full Color camera is cool>>><<<Can you get side quest without a pc like the quest?>>><<<You show USB PCVR connection in the menu, have you tried it out?>>><<<Is het mogelijk om usb c naar aux oordopjes aan te sluiten ?>>><<<Do it have any workout games>>><<<can&#39;t decline the UI is copying Quest&#39;s>>><<<Okay, that&#39;s what we needed most, neck movement without having a heavy Xbox on our face>>><<<Color passthru without XR ... well it sux.>>><<<So my biggest concern is you can&#39;t use wired headphones while playing PC VR with a cable since both would need to use the usbc port. That&#39;s kinda a miss to me.>>><<<Can you use metaverse using this headset and also does it have Netflix app?😊>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=557">9:17</a> they said this headset is wireless only.. which one is true ?>>><<<Can&#39;t wait for it to come to the US>>><<<0:14 In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an Pico 4 while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now.>>><<<the  UIs and the headset it self look a lot like quest 2.>>><<<Wow... not bad at all. I do wish however that there was a 120+ Hz OLED &quot;Pro&quot; version that was made with PCVR in mind with maybe improved in home streaming and full bandwidth cabled option. Would probably pay 550€+ for such an option>>><<<Comfort + Software.... 👈👈👈👈Keys.  I&#39;ve already seen good graphics.....  I&#39;m tired of seeing Beat Sabre and fishing Games...... When consoles dropped..... they dropped with legendary titles.....   they keep trying to sell VR headsets via shhhhty.... games like BS.....Ironman....etc......>>><<<the only disadvantage i can think of is that when the battery degrades, there is no custom headstrap capability, like you said, that&#39;s whta i love about the quest 2, the custom headstraps>>><<<Re:  Lack of an audio jack.  Some people say to use Bluetooth for audio.  However, I have never seen a Bluetooth headset that doesn&#39;t have significant latency.  This will put the video and audio horribly out of sync.  This is why Bluetooth headsets are not used for watching movies, videos or gaming.   There are many videos on this subject, so it is not an isolated issue.  Even if a set of headphones can use aptX, which is supposed to reduce latency, doesn&#39;t mean that Windows will choose to use the aptX codec.  With no way to tell Windows which codec to use, even the best headsets can be limited to lower end codecs, which will mean significant latency.>>><<<when you start a game from steam does it use your pc to run the game or can you change it so the pico 4 runs it?>>><<<Aight impress me>>><<<Thank you for great review. I&#39;m new to VR and a month ago got my Quest 2. Impressed with some game quality like Eleven pool tennis, VR Fishing, but home screens all over nor sharp, and YouTube VR movies not impressed... What about in PICO viewing sharpness quality ? Next month Quest PRO should be announced, interesting to compare to PICO.<br>And New Year beginning Apple ?>>><<<Wish we could buy this in US. Soo gotta go with Quest 2, i guess 😅>>><<<Very nice video as it is well structured and straight forward.Can&#39;t wait to see other videos about the Pico 4.>>><<<Why do companies still do AA and AAA batteries. Why not rechargeable? P1sses me off>>><<<Ccp owns this hardware and &quot;software&quot;.>>><<<Subbed. Looking forward to getting my paws on this.>>><<<If you live with people and play vr often the full color pass through is super useful 😂>>><<<Great video, thank you!  I don&#39;t know if anyone has asked this, but I can&#39;t find the answer - I know Pico isn&#39;t being officially sold in North America, but if you &#39;know a guy&#39; in Europe, could you get a PIco 4 sent over and would it work with Steam VR (or maybe standalone if you had a VPN, etc..).   Is it possible to connect with someone who will ship you a Pico 4 from UK - like on Ebay or something?>>><<<I think I will be buying one as a PCVR upgrade to my quest 2 but not fully sure yet , like 90% sure>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Scott Summers cosplay.>>><<<Is the black black enough ?  Or, the black is just grey, like Quest 2 ?>>><<<It&#39;s perfect>>><<<This is the Best headset for now, before buying anything i would like to recommend waiting until next year, or at least christmas, Sony is launching their PSVR 2, Meta their Quest Pro (and next year Quest 3) and Apple is launching their headset also the next year, the vr market is changing and im waiting until having all to make a choice>>><<<Very nice video. Thank you!>>><<<I&#39;d like to see a review all about usability if someone from the US imports it.... Any issues with doing so.>>><<<Just curious as to why Pico would send someone with 4k subs a headset? Not a hater, just genuinely curious.>>><<<This very cool>>><<<how far up and how far down can your wrist move with those controllers? do the tracking rings get in the way?>>><<<I just got a oculus 2, now I want to get this, cause like the one thing I don’t like about the oculus, is that it it hurts my neck, cause like you said in the video, it’s heavy>>><<<Wii i be able to buy this and ship it here To Sacramento?>>><<<Great review!>>><<<volume button on the arm was a poor design choice, that&#39;s a moving part putting wear on the no doubt copper wire in the volume control, it will in time fray and break>>><<<Omg I need it badly.>>><<<I still think that wireless headsets are too early in tech and needs time to improve while pcvr is still the best for gaming, this is all my preference tho and people have always other opinions.>>><<<Hey nice video. The pico looks great I just don&#39;t like that its owned by tiktok>>><<<honestly rather wait for the new quest the controllers look annoying to play with and is abt the same size as what the new quest looks like and quest might add more and better features and better graphics and comfort>>><<<Can you show me Microsoft flight simulator in action? 👍>>><<<Do they have big screen and poker vr>>><<<With the added usb c to pcvr support, this is near perfect hmd.  Just missing a 3.5mm audio jack, hopefully, the pro version will have it.>>><<<Great video.. I have subscribed... Can you tell me is there a clear difference between image quality on the standalone games or watching films compared to the quest 2 such as screen door effect and can you tell a difference with FOV? Thanks>>><<<Have you tested this for vr pron?>>><<<What about FOV?>>><<<Hey, just thought about the face cover and...Wouldn&#39;t it have the same problem than the Quest 2 default one? Like, wouldn&#39;t it absorb the sweat and all (It looked like it would)>>><<<Great review. It&#39;s disappointing that it doesn&#39;t have DisplayPort, I really can&#39;t stand compressed VR.>>><<<No Jack audio ?? Stupid crap...>>><<<Funny how earlier Pico denied existence of wired connection... Thanks for the review!>>><<<Can&#39;t wait until this eventually hits the US. Looks fantastic.>>><<<Hello. Thank you for this extensive but short review. I like videos like that - short but with a lot of info.<br><br>I have one tiny question: do you know if the buttons or sticks on the controller have a touch detection - aka whether they&#39;re capacitive. These kind of buttons and sticks detect if you just touch them but not press them down.<br><br>I run a community which is mostly about VRChat - and I&#39;d love to recommend another headset than the Quest or Index - the Quest: some people have concerns because of Meta/Facebook - the Index is obviously quite expensive. Unfortunately only the Oculus Touch controllers and Index controllers currently have this feature.>>><<<My rift s died today, and this pico 4 looks very interesting, being exclusivly a PCVR (3070 + r7 7700x) user i have doubts tho, i have never played games in streaming mode, and even tho my internet is very nice (2500mb in down and 700mb in up in ethernet and about 150 down and 150 up in wifi, my router doesnt support wifi6) i dont know if i&#39;m going to get a smooth experience... please reply if you have some knowledge about that>>><<<Wow this looks so nice am definitely buying this as soon as possible, jumping from the original quest this should make a huge difference, especially since i mostly play pcvr games.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7fcMf_xwjw&amp;t=267">4:27</a> , but you can&#39;t play pcvr with cable, pico said it. Is it not true? It would awesome if I am mistaken>>><<<HBO Max? Disney+? I&#39;ve been  waiting for that to show up on Q2..... wondering what&#39;s holding Meta back from offering streaming apps on the store... what&#39;s the resolution like inside these apps? Can you crank it up 4K?>>><<<Great review Sir!>>><<<this headset is incredibly impressive, makes me wish it was available in the US as well, haha.>>><<<Great review! I&#39;m definitely very excited about this headset.<br>I am curious, since the Pico 4 has LCD displays, how are the dark levels?>>><<<Hi all, first of all thank you for watching this video! This is just my first impression Review of the new Pico 4 and my very first Hardware review video :) Don&#39;t forget to check out my Quest 2 vs Pico 4 video for a nice comparison.  Feel free to subscribe to keep notified, It means a lot to me! Besides that, I am very curious what you guys think of this headset! Please let me know! You can preorder the Pico 4 here (UK): <a href="https://amzn.to/3fGMBNP">https://amzn.to/3fGMBNP</a> (Affiliate)>>><<<SO you do have fps vr in your library but did not use  it for making this video wich would habe been rally nice to see what the gpu frame tiwe was and off course fps on screen.>>><<<ik ga hem kopen>>><<<Great content as usual on this channel. I want to buy the Pico 4 but I&#39;m just wondering if the library is good enough right now. Do you recommend it?>>><<<why is the pico so laggy,does it only work propperly with pcvr?>>><<<got mine 2nd hand for 200 ukp in Thailand, it had been updated to 5.7 so none of the previous games worked anymore ,  but now I have got it working with the latest firmware and its superb fun, those 150 minutes of battery life fly by>>><<<When you turn off the headset, does the controller also turn off ?>>><<<Hold on , you mentioned that the Pico 4 only can play STEAM VR titles Wireless but that thing got a USB-C for power and video passthrough>>><<<so the bluetooth on pico 4 does not have a delay?>>><<<This is the most British review I’ve ever seen😂>>><<<daim it i just got the headset as a upgrade to my old Oculus cv1.and my cpu is to old>>><<<pico 4 youses like meta Quest 2 display via link kabel usb c for steam vr Lite update for your video>>><<<Only 1 year warranty:(>>><<<herd pico games are waterdown game length compared to quest 2.>>><<<Pico 4 vr or psvr2?>>><<<I bought the Pico 4, but returned it because I experienced a little latency to the headset tracking. Especially noticeable when I was turning my head quickly or wiggling from side to side.<br>But definitely enough to create motion sickness.<br>Something I never experienced in my Quest 2.<br><br>Too bad as the image was definitely clearer.<br><br>Did anyone else experience this?>>><<<where do you get your anime wallpapers from??>>><<<I may be tempted if it had skybox vr support by miles the best vr video player.>>><<<Can you create multiple accounts for multiple people so that it remembers theirs IPDs? Like for me with 66 and for my son with 62, so we do not have to change it manually every time? Thanks.>>><<<Hi! Thanks so much for you vid. I was looking into getting myself some VR-goggles. Should I go for the Pico 4, the Meta Quest 2 or should I wait? (the Quest 2 is about 2 years old now?) perhaps it&#39;s a new one around the corner? Thanks :)>>><<<This is my humor>>><<<Awesome ! I am glad you did a review on this VR headset Because I own The quest 2 but I hate the fact that I have to use my Facebook account in order to log in , I like the fact that you don&#39;t need that with this Headset>>><<<the pico 4 its a bad anti aliasing vr, its so jagged compare with good old quest 2 , quest 2 its way2 better, the reviewer its to hype for pico 4 i think every reviewer>>><<<Hi Chris.  Can you help me?   I just got a Pico 4.  I created an account with an email address on the VR Assistant android app, verified it, all ok on the app.   Then when I try to log in with that email on the Pico4 headset, it says &#39;This user does not exist&#39;.  Any ideas?>>><<<Hello good morning I am interested in VR but Sony&#39;s offer is too expensive 😞 I will go Pico4 as I keep hearing out great it is 🇬🇧>>><<<Thanks!>>><<<What was that boxing game you got there?>>><<<I bought the Pico 4 last week however I won&#39;t be getting my hands on it before the end of November.<br>My current VR Headset is the HTC Vive but I rarely use it because I don&#39;t like the fornell lens and that also the main reason I bought the Pico 4 instead of a Quest 2.>>><<<Fuggk Facebook>>><<<Will be opening a Pico 4 next Monday. First time VR owners so very much looking forward to the first impression experience>>><<<Think it a great looking headset but I wont be getting one.<br>As an apprentice printer the importance of color was drummed into me and also having something of an artistic bent I can&#39;t help viewing LCD screens as an offensive piece of penny pinching.>>><<<Can I connect it to my PC and play PC VR content on this like Meta Quest 2?>>><<<No Resident Evil 4 VR and no Iron Man VR (which releases on Quest 2 on Thursday). Also no Beat Saber which is massive.>>><<<I had the Pico 4, then just got the meta quest pro. Meta quest pro is so much better>>><<<The lack of display port Is an issue. You Need a high-end PC and network infrastrutture to play PCVR games wireless.>>><<<We got our Pico 4 two weeks ago here in Shanghai for the rather tasty price of £290. Almost sent it back when I discovered that it&#39;s region locked to the Chinese app store but, being Android and pretty open, it was simple to get the global files and side load them. Glad we got this because I was really not up with giving Meta my money. Plus, I think this is the superior product.>>><<<@Everyone who likes the name Oculus Quest 2 More than Meta Quest 2>>><<<I&#39;d be interested in how the pico 4 stands up to a virtual home office scenario. I know immersed is coming to the pico 4 soon but no idea if there is another alternative to such things as Vive Sync or Horizon workrooms for the pico platform?<br><br>Did you try any productivity use cases for the headset?<br>Does it operate while plugged in and charging?<br>Can it tether over usb-c display port to a PC (like the quest 2 link cable) or is it wireless only?<br>Is the clarity of a desktop environment such as Desktop+ readable at 1080p like resolution or higher?<br>Is it comfortable enough to wear for extended periods 3+ hour sessions?<br>Does it get hot like the Vive cosmos?<br>Does it handle sunlight lit bright rooms ok? I know the Quest 2 used to freak out about it and the Vive cosmos (non elite) just plain didnt work in bright rooms.<br>Do the controllers provide any kind of pass through charging for the batteries?>>><<<TS which is the best or cheapest Sammy to get just for the emojis that look more poppy than my Realme 7 5G one and with super power battery mode cheers>>><<<I think the lack of library compared to the Meta Quest 2 is a little unfair. I have the Quest 2 but only play games from Steam on it. And I do the same if I had this Pico one. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough of a benefit though to change the Quest 2 right now. I am interested to see what the Quest Pro brings to the table though. Hopefully the Elite strap as standard, as the standard Quest 2 standard one is terrible>>><<<I&#39;ve just got a Meta Quest 2, I assume there isn&#39;t much difference tbh, but what we all want to know is how does PronHub VR perform 😂>>><<<I want this so bad it&#39;s perfect for me>>><<<Wireless PCVR is where the Pico shines the most. I even do not understand who play those PS2 lookin standalone &quot;games&quot;.>>><<<@Tech Spurt<br> did you update the OS to 5.2 or ? you have apps that only reviewers with 5.2 OS seem to have (the disney / prime etc)<br>I&#39;m stuck on 5.1 and dont have them 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ also mine draines battery faster than.....was going to put a wife vibrator joke here but it&#39;s a family friendly show right ? :D>>><<<I saw another review of this and it said that there&#39;s an adapter available to plug in headphones>>><<<Looks like good value for the money 🤑>>><<<For Pc Gaming this or the Meta?<br>Cable support seems like a huge advantage regarding quality>>><<<I still will not get a wireless headset at this time.  They sound nice, but I prefer my tethered VR headsets for the best PCVR and connected to my Graphics card.  Too many pre-requirements to run the best speeds from wireless and still not as good as direct connections to the PC.  I mainly do sitting SIM Racing on my gaming PC.<br>I keep watching all the you tube videos on wireless, and will wait till next year to see what is on the plate for updated or new wireless VR.<br>Thanks for the video.  Take care.>>><<<Are the images sharper and is the render resolution better than quest 2??>>><<<Hello , all time you give good Product thank you>>><<<Fresh>>><<<Saw the thumbnail and wondered why Uncle Spurt had his pants on his head! 🤔>>><<<Nice>>><<<Cool 😎>>><<<yo>>><<<2 minutes ago gang>>><<<I have a pico 4 full moded with accus, heatstrap and so on. I testet the Q3 and the Q3 is so much better but not comortable at stok>>><<<Just bought the Pico 4 as it was on sale at a local online store, less the price of a bnew Quest 2 in fact. It is a steal. I only play pcvr mainly. I actually also own and will keep my Quest 2 as a back up>>><<<it&#39;s better at spying on you    . ❤>>><<<Excellent review, thank you.>>><<<Im only getting a vrheadset for Vrchat only so I ask which is better Pico 4 or Quest 3? cause Vrchat now supports Pico 4 and I have been thinking but I cant decide due to my Autism where Im having a bit of trouble deciding things>>><<<I had a Quest 2 and changed to the Pico 4 a year ago and found it to be so much better, I recently sold it and bought a Quest 3, what a mistake I should never have got rid of my Pico 4, luckily although has been expensive I now have a Pico 4 again, it&#39;s far better in every way down even the menu system and UI is far better, the only downside is less games, I also find it so much more comfortable and don&#39;t get any light bleed like you do it could possibly be your head shape? I won&#39;t be changing again that&#39;s for sure!>>><<<Is it possible to use this vr gogle as a monitor for gaming on pc or PS4?>>><<<Do you know if the Pico 4 will work in the U.S? I have a friend in the UK who could ship me one from there, but I want to make sure everything will work all right here.>>><<<all the movies i see with pico 4 it looks like its lagging alot,and quest 3 running smooth,is pico running better now and with more mixed reality?or are pico only good for pcvr?>>><<<Do you think i should buy the quest 2 or the pico4? I really don&#39;t know (can&#39;t buy the quest3 btw)>>><<<really well made review, thank you>>><<<Bought a Pico 4 for my first vr headset for half the price of a brand new one. Around $500 AUD instead of up to 1000$ AUD, Mainly being used for PCVR and Steam games due to the high rez per eye display. People still gota understand that you need a pretty beefy machine to even run 90htz or more for VR.>>><<<I like more pico 4 over quest 3>>><<<Do you have the global or chinese face interface?>>><<<Pico 4 isn’t quite as good as quest 2>>><<<I will gonna to buy Pico 4 over Quest 3 in Half of the price, because I&#39;m PCVR player , there no BIG different between Quest 3 and Pico 4>>><<<just wait until pico 5>>><<<Thanks for review, I&#39;m choosing between Q3 and P4 right now! &lt;3<br>I have questions that I may&#39;ve missed in your review.<br>1) whats with limited pc-link bandwidth of P4? Does it hurt much? Do you notice any lags or compression artifacts?<br>2) I read P4 has noticeable &quot;ghosting&quot; effect (ghost copy of bright object). Do you notice that alot? Does that hurt immersion?>>><<<My Pico 4 is being delivered tomorrow. What game(s) should I download?! 🙏☺️>>><<<Hello! I am a aspiring in this VR World. I always apreciate the VR and ever want to experience this wonderful. Perhaps i am from a poor country and i have a poor salary, so i never used or brought. Soon, I saw this annoucement for quest 3 and i become a mad lol. But, watching this video i don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do. What&#39;s do you recommends for me? Quest 3? This pico4 (or I wait for pico5)? Other model? Again, I don&#39;t know anything like hardware, what is pancake lens or else 😅. I&#39;m just a tecnology apreciate . What&#39;s you recommend for a first experience and the bestest VR? (Sorry by the long text 😅)>>><<<After i learned that pico is owned by the parent company of tiktok i said to myself, i much rather have americans have my data than the chinese.>>><<<You sound like Bruce from Family Guy. 😂>>><<<I don&#39;t see how you could use over the ear headphones with Pico 4 since it covers the tops of your ears.>>><<<Pico 4 in my country Nz goes for $699 . A bare bones 128 gb Quest 3 will cost $929! And 512 gb? $1129.<br><br>Add in a elite strap and that&#39;s $1250 competing against a very  similar pcvr experiance you can get for less than half that?😡<br><br>And Pico 5 is only in April!>>><<<Hello Harry, is worth to buy pico 4 pro ? Im now in china and there pico4 pro already in store, but in torrents, forums I can&#39;t find any guid to change location>>><<<Does Pico 4 censor stuff like words?>>><<<I loved mine, recently I have developed an awkward performance blurp, the face foam is hard on the forehead, the visuals are awesome tho, I run it 250% in Steam VR,  I came from the Q2, and previous to that the Rift S, Rift and DK2.  Never had a single issue with tracking, I spend most of my time in DCS.>>><<<pico的游戏太少，除非你玩steamvr>>><<<I purchased Pico 4 to replace Quest 2 after it lunched mainly due to massive youtube hypetrain. And I was pretty dissapointed, everything felt so &quot;beta&quot; compared to Q2. My main problem was lack of any good PCVR connection at the time,  resulting in worse image than Airlink. So it was actually a downgrade and I got rid of it... I also had a lot of pupil swim, but I can see it even in Q Pro so maybe my eyes dont like pancakes.<br><br>I think Pico missed a big oportunity releasing it unpolished. The price, is great, the specs are great. The passthrough was vomit inducing though 😂>>><<<Purchased mine 6 days ago and was initially impressed, but as time went on I realised there was an issue.<br><br>No matter what adjustment I did to the ipd I could not get a clear focus. Also I was getting a slight heat haze/ shimmering effect on the visuals. Small text was sort of shimmering, although when I angled my head over to right or left shoulder it corrected the issue.<br><br>Bit of a shame but I returned them as defective due to watching many youtube vids with the pico 4 showing none of these issues.<br><br>Reddit has many comments on these visual aberrations on the pico 4. many were saying it is down to known manufacturing issues on sets made in certain batches during 2021 and 2022.<br><br>Shame I was looking forward to using it, but I think I will wait another year or so and see how the vr/ar industry progresses. <br><br>I will watch your channel to see how advancements in the more budget range progress.>>><<<If Pico sold in the USA I would buy it. But they don’t threfore Meta quest 3>>><<<Leaks have the Pico 5 releasing next year with better resolution than the Quest 3. I will wait for more Pico 5 announcements.>>><<<if Q3 had eye tacking they would monopolize the market immeditely. One major problem with commercial vr is that you cant see anything outsite the center of the screen. Like pico 4, if use as a desktop vr browse internet I cannot read anything if dont move my head to center what I want to read...>>><<<I think the Q3 will be similar to the P4 for visuals and if one display, the P4 would be better.  As far as visuals for gaming, Q3 is obviously going to be better with the faster SOC.>>><<<how can you compare an unreleased product to something that is actually available>>><<<i mainly want to use PCVR so should i go for pico 4 or wait for quest 3?>>><<<Have had my P4 for a few days now.  Visuals look better than the Q2 and QP, since way less screen door.  Good set for movies and media!  Added:  The huge 3.1GB update made a big difference.  Better color and contrast to go along with the panel resolution.  The video player has an enhanced video setting that makes it look great and I&#39;m a picky SOB.>>><<<I&#39;m using my Pico4 mainly for PCVR and my Quest2 for fitness. Yesterday I played Skyrim VR with my Quest2 instead of the Pico4. I was curious if all updates of the Quest2 made any change (faster processing and GPU) and after that with my Pico4. Well.... Pico4 was a big winner once again. If you only play PCVR, there is no doubt about it: Pico4.<br>But I will buy the Quest3, since it will have similar lenses and a much better chip. To me the Quest3 will be a Pico4 and Quest2 melted together and will have the benefits of both headsets.<br>I also heard the rumour that there is a Pico5 coming to the market.... I&#39;m curious.>>><<<If the Quest 3 just had 4k microOLEDs per eye, it would be the best headset for the next 5 years.>>><<<disappointing these companies cant include $2 displayport over usb c connection they probably do it on purpose so people are more inclined to use the in headset store. If have they money get bigscreen beyond.>>><<<Need to know if the Q3 has one or two displays.  If one, a lot less resolution than the P4.  Making two displays eats a lot of horizontal resolution and is not accounted for in the specs.  Same for Q2.>>><<<I personally going for meta headsets. Meta has a way better library and better support. Overall, Meta has more experience in vr technology and has a better future in vr industry. I am definitely going for quest 3.>>><<<lol not even close, I think they&#39;re releasing a Pico 5 tho.>>><<<I&#39;d like good quality pcvr but at a budget around $500 I must choose between having display port or pancake lenses. Which would you choose? I&#39;ve heard pancake looks great but I don&#39;t know if that will be offset by the compression of usb vs dp.>>><<<I&#39;m just waiting for a company to have that light bulb moment. Realizing that the real potential in these headsets has everything to do with evolving inside the desktop computing space.>>><<<im sure its a great headset but the fact that all the games ive bought are link to my quest account it only makes sense to stay with meta. now if the pico 5 comes and they offer titles that will not be found any where else that are big tripple A games then that would probably make me migrate if its a better headset and if it has a ton of games>>><<<Pimax crystal is worht the money or should i buy pico 4 ? the Crystal is so much better than Pico 4? What do you think?>>><<<Thanks for the review! Very insightful!>>><<<That would suck if you punched the guard rail for your staircase.....   it would probably shatter however i punch my tv all the time and it still works fine though 😂>>><<<hát ez nagyon gagyi gyerekek!<br>ingyen kellene osztogatniuk>>><<<Literally ps1, ps2 gaming graphics 🤣🤣🤣 waste of money 💀💀💀>>><<<liessss>>><<<meta quest 2 better>>><<<I purchased a local Chinese copy and want to use it in Africa...Is it possible that I will encounter problems while downloading games and updating the system?>>><<<Can you put a SD card into the pico 4?>>><<<Wow 🤩>>><<<❤>>><<<do u still need to use fb?>>><<<I heared those vents are for ventilating your eyes and the lenses, to prevent fog building up.>>><<<it is comfort with glasses user ?>>><<<ay im getting mine in 2 weeks>>><<<I think I have the Chinese version. Excellent hardware. Sharp, good tracking great sound. You didn&#39;t even mention the hand tracking which is in beta.<br><br>Through my WiFi 6e router it plays steam VR games fine including msfs but there is a slight lag that makes beat saber less enjoyable. Even via virtual desktop.<br><br>But my Chinese pico 4 comes with a beat saber rip-off which is actually much better and visually more attractive. It&#39;s called mutrix. Absolutely love it. Except the fact that the game requires the user to login via the internet.

Sometimes it&#39;s okay to mention the good and the bad and still come up with a overwhelmingly positive impression, and an honest one.>>><<<How did you get the Cast to Mobile to work? It doesn&#39;t seem to work on my Samsung Fold 4. My Pico 4 just doesn&#39;t detect my phone.>>><<<Great review, just purchased one from Argos.

The only thing putting me off the Pico 4 is the game library but the specs on this are a lot better and surely any tracking issue or various teething problems will be fixed with software updates and I imagine the game store will keep being updated. Any recommendations or suggestions?>>><<<no Skyrim VR bruh>>><<<Lol, pico 4 is just a crappy mess, don&#39;t believe these paid youtubers amd stick with your quest 2..i&#39;ve earnt it at my own costs.>>><<<Didn&#39;t understand why it never got a US release, it&#39;s definitely a missed opportunity to compete with Oculus, maybe they might change their mind in the future.>>><<<omg imagine if he was naked and pump squatting to that music>>><<<Blimey, are you an employee of Pico?>>><<<Blimey, are you an employee of Pico?>>><<<Stuttering and jittering on tracking headset and controllers.

Do one for the quest and quest pro>>><<<Can you make a video on how to mirror the screen to TV and Mobile?>>><<<On two minds,  it looks a look like the Nintendo wii in vr.>>><<<Got my Pico 4 glasses yesterday and just tested without facemask and eyes as close as possible, the difference is HUGE!<br>Then if you lift little from the strap going over your head to get the weight of your nose.<br><br>That made me think somebody should make similar type facemask for P4 than Quest pro has; that forehead cushion piece and maybe those little pieces on the sides to block light, VOILA. That would make the FOV and experience million times bigger and better.<br><br>Have you tested that?  This would be a huge improvement!>>><<<Nice review Chiqz.>>><<<Technically its better but the SOFTWARE has a long way to go. Plus people apparently are now concerned about their privacy and security when dealing with a ByteDance company... Bit late for that after giving all their lifes data to google/fb/meta/MS  etc...<br><i>Pretty sure they can almost double their battery life if they spend some time on those power profiles. The thing basically runs at full pelt ALL the time, you can tell!</i><br><br><br><br><i>PS. Not trying to be rude but perhaps in future try to not shake head and hands so much as it makes it hard to look at what your showing, from a viewer perspective. I&#39;ve seen other VR YT achieve stable demoing at least in the menus and apps etc...

I have the Quest2 and will keep it, but I bought the Pico4 as well, getting it next week.>>><<<This is very tempting. But I already have invested in the Quest ECO system, can&#39;t switch now!>>><<<Can you play mod maps on contractors with Pico without pcvr>>><<<i like the Pico 4 quite a lot and use it almost every day. Although i have to admit, that the image is not that stable compared to the Quest 2. It just feels a little bit jittery and there is a tiny and strange fisheye effect visible. If you play PCVR this becomes very apparent in my opinion, so you can see the world warping around you depending on what is on screen. I got used to it, but it&#39;s just not as good as on the Quest 2.>>><<<Great video this looks great.😃>>><<<it is no surprise pico 4 is sold out everywhere.  it is amazing.>>><<<That&#39;s one bold statement lol A device is nothing without software support so as good as the Pico 4 is, the Quest 2 is still better because it has better software support. Like why the Raspberry Pi is still the best SBC even though its not as fast as others.>>><<<It will forever be OCULUS. Not meta.>>><<<You forgot the biggest reason for the PROs column of the Pico- It isn&#39;t associated with facebook!!!   :-D>>><<<Awesome walk though mate and I couldn&#39;t agree more I think the pico 4 is amazing>>><<<waht about pcvr?>>><<<If they had added a micro SD slot this would be an immediate purchase.>>><<<Hi Chigz Tech Reviews !<br>I&#39;ve tested now my Pico 4 with Steam VR games, but I have already problems with some games (New Retro Arcade: Neon&quot;, Doom VFR&quot;). The problem is, that always the HTC Vive controllers are shown which prevents the me from being able to control anything. From time to time it happened, that when starting &quot;New Retro Arcade: Neon&quot; the &quot;Quest 2&quot; controllers where shown and I was able to use the game, but still ... pressing one button on the Pico 4 controller lead to pressing 2 Arcade machine buttons.<br>In the settings always the &quot;Oculus Touch&quot; controllers are chosen which should be the best fit since there are non Pico 4 or Quest (2) controllers available.<br>(How) can I solve this problem .... or how do I know that a game works for my Pico before I buy it ?<br>In &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot; no controllers are shown at all and I can&#39;t do anything beside looking around. How do you controll this game ?<br>I would be really pleased if you could help me with this issue or maybe make a video about this issues since for sure more people will have this problem.<br>Thanks in advance !>>><<<Great video but I am sticking with the quest 2!

The Quest exists. As much as I hate Facebook/Meta, they made an affordable headset and brought VR to more consumers than I could ever dream of playing VR.<br>2. PCVR headsets by default are more comfortable than a Quest headset. If you&#39;ve ever put on a default Quest strap versus a default Index strap its a game changer for comfort. There are however, 3rd party straps that you can buy that are more comfortable than the default oculus strap.<br>3. If you have ever tried to use cable management you know that they don&#39;t get tangled if you properly manage them. I have been using almost exclusively PCVR (around 98% PCVR and 2% wireless) over the course of all my time in VR from 2017 till now. Out of that entire time I can count on my hands the amount of times the cable has actually gotten tangled where I needed to stop to fully unrwap it.<br>4. The Quest also has the passthrough camera and this is not new technology.<br>5. I will give credit where credit is due and say that this is the first time I have seen motorized lenses that move automatically to adjust to your eyes.<br><br>Please make sure that you research before you upload. I think this is a great looking headset don&#39;t get me wrong. But it would have been MUCH more effective to talk about the comparison of this to the Quest in terms of resolution, processing, comfort, etc.>>><<<It&#39;s pretty much just an oculus / quest 2>>><<<Just buy a oculus cutest 2>>><<<Oculus:this is racism>>><<<Me, owning an oculus quest 2: Hey I&#39;ve seen this one<br><br>Arun: What do you mean?

I&#39;d also argue that it has the 2nd best audio setup in the industry (right behind the deluxe audio strap for htc headsets,) and the IPD adjustment is fine as a dedicated slider, and with a pulley setup, the cable is completely out of the way. So while I do agree that standalone headsets have some better tech than a simple rift, and the convenience is undeniably good, I still think that the claim of it being lighter and better sounding is a little bs, because the internal components do add heft to an all in one headset, and in strap audio is NEVER as good as over, on, or in ear audio.>>><<<All in one headsets are for people getting into vr just get a pc vr there way better>>><<<almost like there&#39;s something out there that has better stuff>>><<<Man why would I see mu surroundings if I am wearing that headset ...

It supports positional tracking with six degrees of freedom, using internal sensors and an array of cameras in the front of the headset rather than external sensors. The cameras are also used as part of the safety feature &quot;Passthrough&quot;, which shows a view from the cameras when the user exits their designated boundary area. A later software update added &quot;Oculus Link&quot;, a feature that allows the Quest to be connected to a computer via USB, enabling use with Oculus Rift-compatible software and games.[4]<br><br>The Oculus Quest received praise for its price and convenience, and for having improved graphical fidelity and tracking over Oculus Go, but was panned for its front-heavy build and downgraded graphics quality over PC-based VR games. At launch, it also faced criticism for being limited to software available on the Oculus Store, and not having backwards compatibility with Oculus Go software. The later introduction of Oculus Link led to reappraisals of the Quest, with critics praising the device&#39;s increased flexibility, and indicating that devices like the Quest would likely supplant the PC-only Rift headsets moving forward. A successor, the Oculus Quest 2, was released in 2020.<br><br>History:<br>At Oculus Connect 3 in 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Oculus was working on a standalone virtual reality headset codenamed &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;.[5][6] At Oculus Connect 4 the following year, it was announced that Oculus planned to issue software development kits for the new model in 2018. They also revealed the accompanying controllers, which would be similar to the Oculus Rift&#39;s touch controllers.[7]<br><br>In 2018 at Connect 5, it was announced that the new headset would be known as the Oculus Quest and would be priced at US$399. At F8 2019 it was announced that the Quest would ship on May 21, 2019.[8][9] At launch, the device was priced at US$399 for the 64 GB version, and US$499 for the 128 GB version.[10][11]<br><br>A successor model, the Oculus Quest 2, was announced on September 16, 2020. It was released on October 13 starting at $299 for the 64GB version and $399 for the 128 GB version.[12]<br><br>Specifications:<br>The Oculus Quest uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip (SoC) with 4 GB of RAM. Three of the four 2.3 GHz CPU cores of the chip are reserved for software, while the remaining core and its four lower-power cores are reserved for motion tracking and other background functions. [3][13] It runs an Android-based operating system, with modifications to enhance performance in VR applications.[2] A smartphone running the Oculus app is required in order to conduct first-time setup.[14]<br><br>A diamond Pentile OLED display is used for each eye, with an individual resolution of 1440 × 1600 and a refresh rate of 72 Hz.[15] The headset uses the &quot;next generation&quot; lens technology originally introduced in Oculus Go, which helps to enlarge the sweet spot of the lens. Visual artifacts such as God rays are less prominent but still visible in scenes with high contrast.[16][17] It also features physical interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment.[18]<br>Tracking.<br>Unlike the Oculus Go, which used a limited handheld remote that only supported limited motion tracking,[19] the Quest supports positional tracking with six degrees of freedom (compared to the Go&#39;s three).[20]<br><br>Rather than use external sensor cameras in the play area to spatially track the headset and controllers (as was the case with the original Oculus Rift CV1), Oculus Quest utilizes an &quot;inside-out&quot; tracking system known as &quot;Oculus Insight&quot;. Based on the concept of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), infrared diodes on the Oculus Touch controllers are tracked via four wide-angle cameras built into the front of the headset. This is combined with accelerometer input from the controllers and headset, as well as AI algorithms to predict the path of motion when the controllers are outside of the cameras&#39; field of view.[21][22][23]<br><br>The cameras are also used as part of a safety feature known as &quot;Passthrough&quot;, which displays a grayscale view from the cameras when the player exits their defined playing area.[24] At Oculus Connect 6, it was announced that the feature would be upgraded to &quot;Passthrough+&quot; as on the Oculus Rift S (which also uses Insight), making it stereoscopic and stereo-correct.[25] A &quot;Passthrough on Demand&quot; feature was added in Quest system software version 15, allowing the user to quickly access the Passthrough view by double-tapping the left or right side of the headset.[26]<br>Hand tracking.<br>During Oculus Connect 6, it was announced that hand tracking would be added to the Quest in early-2020, utilizing machine learning, Oculus Insight, and &quot;model-based tracking&quot; to recognize the position and gesture of the user&#39;s hands without additional hardware.[27][28][29]<br><br>Hand tracking was initially introduced as an experimental feature in December 2019, as part of Quest system software version 12. It was limited to the main user interface and selected built-in apps, such as the web browser. It was also announced that the Oculus Quest SDK would be updated to add support for the feature.[27][30] In May 2020, hand tracking exited beta, and became available for use in third-party software beginning May 28.[31]<br>Controllers.<br>The Oculus Quest uses second generation Oculus Touch controllers. Their designs were modified to accommodate Oculus Insight, with their tracking rings moved from the back of the controllers to their tops so that they can be tracked by the headset&#39;s cameras.[32]<br>Audio.<br>The Quest has embedded speakers, as well as a pair of 3.5 mm audio jacks on each side for use with external headphones.[33]>>><<<It is like a better oculus>>><<<no ones talking about the self destructive headset 💀>>><<<Off brand oculus>>><<<ever heard of a thing called oculus yeah its 20x better>>><<<Oculus>>><<<Bro rare mrwhostheboss L💀💀>>><<<we got meta crying in the corner>>><<<Onculs left the gc crying and sobbing>>><<<2>>><<<What about the oculus quest 3>>><<<Oculus on a budget>>><<<He just described the oculus>>><<<If anyone is curious about what game he is playing it is called ultimechs vr its basically rocket league but instead of cars its mechs>>><<<Sounds just like the quest 2>>><<<Man missed the quest 2 hype.>>><<<It actually looks cool!>>><<<Me: omg another quest ripoff>>><<<The quest does all of this except the auto eye adjusting thing>>><<<Dang, it’s almost like the meta quest has been out for multiple years and also has pass through, a headband sound system, adjustable lenses, head movement tracking, and is lightweight btw and also is wireless, AND with a active catalog of add-ons a to the headset and also a long battery life and the only wires being the charger.. y’know, just a thought>>><<<I have be 2 and you don’t need Wires>>><<<Quest but more goofy>>><<<that vr is lag>>><<<<b>oculus has left the chat</b>>>><<<Bro this is just oculus>>><<<Found it for $18 dollars on aliexpress>>><<<Bro’s kind stupid look at oculus/meta quest 2 it literally way better>>><<<It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s exactly the same as quest>>><<<Someone said China copied everything<br>PICO: I&#39;m not a copy, I lead>>><<<Mom can we have oculus quest 2<br>No we have it at home<br>Oculus at home>>><<<This tech has been out for years now<br><br>How are you just now learning bruh>>><<<Oculus; are you serious right neoowww bro>>><<<Bro there is a oclus>>><<<Sounds Like a rip off ocolus 🤷‍♂️>>><<<It’s sponsored, he’s trying tell sell us shit>>><<<Cooling system>>><<<Bro just described the ocules>>><<<Those glasses are bull chocolate 🍫>>><<<Oculus quest 2….????

Majority of buyers buy VR for PCVR gaming. There isn&#39;t much content on Pico library &amp; no way you guys can compete with Meta easily. <br>So the only way you guys could get ahead of Meta quest 2 was in PCVR segment. But even in that, Don&#39;t know which fool is taking decisions in your company that you didn&#39;t even consider to put Display Port in Pico 4. One of the main reason why I purchased Quest 2 instead of Pico 4 &amp; compromised myself without pancake lense. Just why the hell can&#39;t you guys put a simple Display Port in Pico 4 when you already used to have it on Pico 3 link. You guys don&#39;t know how much sales you could have ahead of quest 2 with just this one simple thing.>>><<<I’m just confused why you guys removed DisplayPort from the pico 4. I really just don’t understand why you did that, since you had it on the pico 3 link.

I domt pay that much neither to pico nor visionpro>>><<<I am testing P4 vs Q3. I wish P4 could have Q3 lenses. More FOV, more details, more brightness. But Q3 not comfortable, heave on front. Also P4 has horrible reflection from bright vs darker scene!  I guess will return both and will keep P3.

The only good thing I can tell that the quest 3 has is a better processor and a depth sensor, which honestly is not really important as someone with a pico 4. the cpu that the pico uses can run most games, even blade and sorcery, at a smooth 90hz without jittering.>>><<<Quest 3>>><<<pico 4 controllers are better than quest 2 en 3 because pico 4 controllers dont get stick drift>>><<<unfortunately quest 3 is not fully available in the country (Indonesia) therefore the price is much more expensive, and there is also no Indonesian language support.>>><<<just got a pico 4 for 200$, super excited>>><<<I dont know man, i&#39;m not convinved. Pico 4 has better visual/ clarity then meta quest 3. More comfortable. I&#39;m more interested in playing games. how responsive it is and the clarity, the rest is just marketing. So that would make pico 4 a better choice right ?>>><<<Quest 3 is double the price.>>><<<We need an external battery>>><<<You do know that if you have a Meta account, you can download and move those games to Pico4, right?  😂>>><<<As someone who just wants to do pcvr i feel like leaning towards the pico 4 instead of the quest 3>>><<<I had the Pico4 and switched to the Quest 3. But only because I play sports games competitively and I need the 120 hz and always fast updates). The Quest 3 is a bit better everywhere except for the price and the comfort (even with Elitestrap, because it&#39;s lighter and the weight is nicely distributed). <br><br>There are 3 groups I recommend the Pico 4 to<br><br>In PCVR they are almost at eye level (Quest 3 slightly better), but since the comfort and price is significantly better, I would go for the Pico 4 (+Virtual Desktop) for pure PCVR. <br><br>Even pure sports gamers (unless you play competitively) will have more fun with the Pico 4, due to the better wearing comfort and because the graphics are second-rate<br><br>And casual gamers who don&#39;t need a huge game library and have to watch their money when buying. <br><br>Ultimately, the Quest 3 is the better, more sophisticated headset and if money is no object, I would always choose it over the Pico 4. If it does, I would recommend the Pico 4 to the groups mentioned above.>>><<<I love this vid because I’m getting one soon and idk what to get thanks ima get it for my bday>>><<<Been holding back on any meta vr. Think ill wait until they stop the idea of putting adds in the set. Worst of all they want to pause adverts if you close your eyes or take headset off. Not sure how true this is though.>>><<<The Pico 4 is currently 380 euros in Europe and 545 for the Quest 3. For PC VR only the Pico 4 is the best. Of course it is less better than the Quest 3. It came out before. As for the games. On Android you can play anything. I saw a guy playing Asgard&#39;s Wrath on Pico 4. Yeah yeah it&#39;s not legal blablabla>>><<<Quest 3 has lots of quality issues. I see many people on Reddit talking about how they returned 5+ units to get a device without dead/stuck pixels or poorly made lens.>>><<<Nice riview ❤>>><<<At least Meta waited 3 years before releasing the Quest 3 so it didn&#39;t piss off it&#39;s customer base. A year and a half since the Pico 4 was released is too short of a time frame to release an entirely new model. Their customers JUST got the headset and it&#39;s still not polished yet. They have a LOT of work to do on the Pico 4 still. They shouldn&#39;t just jump ship to a brand new headset model like that. <br><br>I knew when the Pico 4 came out it would not be on top for long at all and only the high resolution screens were worth buying the headset, but for everything else, Meta had the better ownership experience overall. <br><br>No matter what Pico comes out with, Meta is just too far ahead right now for it to matter. Quest 3 is DEFINITELY the best VR headset when compared to the Pico 4. No doubt about it.>>><<<Quest 3 is the best pcvr and standallone  headset🎉🎉🎉>>><<<You will get disappointed if you buy quest 3 for mixed reality. The camera looks like old webcam.<br>Rather than buy quest 3,buy pico 4 instead, the camera quality is same and the lens also pancake and I believe pico 4 lens more wide and will not get you nausea.>>><<<Do you belive in reality shifting>>><<<Do you even own some of these headsets?

Made politicians seem honest in comparison.  😮>>><<<Advanced Beat Saber players beware! Considering the Pico4 for playing everything Expert+ on Beat Saber? TLDR: Forget it!<br><br>Long version:<br>- If you use the Pico Streaming assistant either over Wifi or over USBC, and you crank up the video settings to the max, the image quality is still inferior to a Valve Index because it&#39;s blurry. Lower the settings and it becomes more blurry. No matter how, it&#39;s blurry despite the pancake lenses. Personally I prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect (as on the Index), than a blurry image without. Some say the Pico streamer app is compressing the video too much. Who knows. Whatever the limitation is, it sucks.<br>- So if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you&#39;ll need to use Virtual Desktop. Virtual Desktop consists of 2 parts: an app on the Pico and a streamer app on your PC. But, there&#39;s a but. Virtual Desktop&#39;s streamer app wants to go over Wifi only. There used to be workarounds involving &quot;tethering over USB&quot; but after the last firmware update they don&#39;t work anymore. The workaround involved installing an Android app (APK) which allowed you to access all of the Pico&#39;s hidden settings. Besides, it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up, tons of forums to read on Reddit, hard to get right on the first try, and you had to enable the settings on the Pico and on your PC every time before playing. Uggh! <br>If with your previous headset you used to just &quot;start VR&quot; and play, this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker.<br><br>- But now for <i>the</i> major deal breaker: The controllers!!<br>OMG these controllers are SO bad for playing Beat Saber! It&#39;s worse if you have big hands. Their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and <i>secure</i> grip. You end up clicking buttons all the time while playing (and you know what that does). The plastic is super slippery. When playing fast they <i>will</i> slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed. Don&#39;t even think of playing any Camellia map. When you see youtubers play Beat Saber with them they all play very slowly. Clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming. The tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play: it &quot;works&quot; but it&#39;ll ruin your PP.<br><br>For the rest, I found the face mask to be very uncomfortable (compared to a Valve Index), but I guess YMMV and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and don&#39;t let light in from the sides.<br><br>I returned my Pico4 after less than a week of daily use.<br>The poor image quality due to the streaming limitations, and the slippery un-ergonomic inaccurate controllers, made me do so.>>><<<The main thing is that the helmet does not come and is not defective.>>><<<All I want is vrchat standalone and hand tracking for pc>>><<<Are you able to play Oculus games from the Oculus Rift store like you can on the quest or it it just limited to Steam games?>>><<<What do you mean &quot;on&quot; accident???

Guys. I am thinking even neo 3 I dont want it to cost much because I am thinking of meta autumn presentations or save for ps vr2>>><<<In my country the Pico 4 is 200 euros cheaper so I&#39;m really considering buying it>>><<<I wonder why anyone would want a higher res display than quest2, if pico doesnt have display port input as well as quest.  As you know, even on q2 you need to run much higher res than native to account for the lens curvature or something. So, to run pcvr on q2 with native res, you need at least 3080.. i strongly doubt that anyone with a better gpu than that will buy pico or quest instead of a real pcvr headset..>>><<<I have a gaming pc with a rtx 3050 and 16 gigabytes of RAM and I do not own any brown head sets. And I’m wondering should I wait for the quest 3 of buy the Pico 4 🤔<br>If anyone has any recommendations please let me know>>><<<People only use it for pcvr lol. Its clearly not that good>>><<<Had a Pico 4 for less than 2 weeks and ended up returning it and getting a Quest 2 instead. Tons of issues with their Streaming Assistant software (on top of their software asking for Admin rights, yikes...), no solution for these issues, the only &quot;alternative&quot; to their software (if your unit&#39;s wifi works properly) is Virtual Desktop which is for wireless only. Wireless was faulty in my unit, so i was forced to play with a usb-c cable. Wired image quality was just as bad as wireless, Streaming Assistant suffered from broken audio when used through USB and Virtual Desktop doesn&#39;t have an official way to use it through usb, and the &quot;hacky&quot; solution to get it working through USB can and WILL provoke blue screens on your pc.<br><br>Let me add that all the software was up to date, latest versions of both the firmware and the streaming assistant software.<br><br>Slightly superior hardware to the Quest 2 is worth nothing if the package as a whole leaves a bad taste in the user&#39;s mouth thanks to their extremely shoddy and glitchy software and drivers.<br>Avoid Pico until their software matures enough to be a true competitor to Quest.>>><<<meh stand alon content isent what i care about  i want afordability and to play my pc vr games  and not have the isseu that Q2 lenses have>>><<<&#39;&#39;This is of course a standalone DEVICE and this is where my main issue LIES&#39;&#39; - The Mysticle>>><<<Do you know if quest 3 pass through will look better? <br><br>Pico 4 vs quest pro pass through, which is better? <br><br>I heard quest pro has Grey spots.>>><<<Btw., is it normal that in the view is blurry on the sides?

Avoiding the direct competition with meta in the U.S. might be one of their condition must meet if they want to use the Qualcomm chip inside their product. (Just random guessing) So I am expecting Pico never will have any products release in the states.😢>>><<<Did the Pico 4 come with wifi built in?

I&#39;m using Quest 2 from one month for PCVR with USB3 cable. I spent a lot of time to find out the best configuration (FPS and Quality). And now a lot of YT and internet hype for Pico 4 with Virtual Desktop (aka game changer and so on..) It&#39;s a bullshit for me. I&#39;ve bought Pico 4 few days ago for better FOV, resolution and overall &quot;image quality&quot;. Tested everything (WiFi6, USB-C etehernet card, USB3 cable, Streaming Assistant and Virtual Desktop (Godlike on my RTX 4090). Sorry, there is no way to have even close what i have on Quest 2 with OpenXR Toolkit and Open Composite with USB3 cable (I mean FPS and overall image quality not FOV of course). Now I will return my Pico 4, stay with Quest 2 and in the time where I wait for Quest 3 I will try HP Reverb G2 V2 because have also better spec then Q2 but can work same straight way like Q2 (OXRT, OC) without this sh**ty heavy SteamVR which Pico 4 use. Try your configuratiion with Virtual Desktop instead Streaming Assistant and You will see much better quality and performance, yes it&#39;s true. But again, for me even VD it&#39;s not to close what i&#39;ve got from OXRT and OC. I wanted to have the same quality and performance on Pico 4, and even better due to the spec, but it&#39;s not possible until Pico 4 will not fully natively supports/uses Open XR.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=400">6:40</a> sounds like a robot voice?>>><<<To have more games to play.

Does it allow me to play VR while laying down in bed?>>><<<A very well balanced review. I just ordered a Pico 4 yesterday. I wanted a PCVR headset, but also wanted the option to use it stand-alone. I thought the Pico 4 looked like a great option for someone who, like me, will be using it as a hybrid VR headset. And for the price it seems hard to have much buyer&#39;s remorse.<br><br>I would have liked to see 120hz to pair with the increased 8 GB of RAM over the Quest 2, but 90hz should be more than serviceable. <br><br>The real question will be how the Pico storefront and developer support looks over time. If we start seeing apps like VR Chat and Beat Saber come to the system we&#39;ll know it&#39;s a true competitor to the Quest 2.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=578">9:38</a> OR ALVR, which is also free>>><<<Hi, what about the FOV? How does it compare to the Quest 2?>>><<<Why nobody when reviewing pico 4 when saying there is no 3.5mm jack say that you can use usb c to 3.5mmjack or usb to usb c and 3.5mmjack.>>><<<I had the quest 1. Used it about 30 days. Not all days of course. Returned it. How can the pico 4 increase my experience better and let me keep it?<br><br>I can always return the headset back to the store within 50 days.>>><<<I think you did really well on this video! I like scripted content a lot and I didn&#39;t even notice you looking at your screen before you mentioned it. Good job!>>><<<I&#39;m still rocking an old Samsung WindowsMR &amp; would pick up a Pico 4 for an upgrade in a heartbeat if they would start selling it in Canada.>>><<<a great video as always.<br>At the moment i`m using the Quest1 from work, and mostly together with my Desktop or laptop with steamVR.<br><br>i`ve heared several people mention problems with the wireless connection between Pico 4 and pc.<br>Do you have any idea if they will look into this?>>><<<strictly PCVR, have had my quest 2 since launch. pico 4 arrived from across the pond this weekend. side loaded the phone app and got virtual desktop. the headset is fantastic. the weight, resolution, lenses, and FOV improvements coming from the Q2 are immediately apparent. the superior cooling is also a big bonus. I never use 120hz on the Q2 anyway as it gets too hot and smokes batteries, so nothing lost there. but I will say that one of the first things I did was order an aftermarket facial interface. the stock one is *awful*, presses hard on my cheekbones and gives me a headache. so I may still be daily driving my Q2 until the boat arrives with the new one. otherwise I&#39;m happy with it and look forward to raving hard!>>><<<When i play quest 2 my eyes are more or less fine but when i watch 3D movies, my eyes gets tired and I don&#39;t know why>>><<<No VRC and wired headphone/earbud capability on standalone play which is mind boggling because that flushes every other &quot;advantage&quot; Pico 4 had down the drain>>><<<i got an pico 4 for christmas- birthday i have birthday on christmas yea and from my experience i can say the pico 4 is much better than the quest 2>>><<<What&#39;s keeping me from buying the Pico 4 is the fact that they don&#39;t have finger tracking :c  and for some games that&#39;s essential for me xd>>><<<I own the Pico 4 and Quest 2.  I HATE using my quest 2 as it just feels like old tech.  The FOV and pancake lenses along with the lighter design make the Pico 4 a no brainer!  However, I wish we had more accessories available in the US!  Thanks for the honest review.  And BTW with a dedicated router, wireless PCVR is soooo worth it.  I have had no luck with the wired Pico 4 link software though.  It just doesnt connect.  really strange>>><<<Fair video. Have nothing really to add. Beside maybe, that some underrate the feature to install APKs. You can use for example XBox Game Pass Ultimate to stream flat games online to your Pico 4, same with other such services. Of course you can also stream Steam Flat games to the Pico 4 without using VD. Or you use a Shadow Cloud PC for VR and Flat streaming from everywhere you have a good enough Internet connection. You can also use Android Emulators to play retro games inside Pico 4. There are a lot interesting Android apps you can easily use with the Pico 4, all thanks to the nativ support of APKs which is all much more complicated on the Quest 2. Meta blocks a lot of Android features what Pico 4 didn&#39;t block and that makes that headset even more versatile.>>><<<i have a pico 4 since 1 month now and before, SteamVR was very laggy but there has been an update recently and now it works just fine<br>don&#39;t know if it&#39;s only for Pico users or Quest 2 too>>><<<I think the most of the missing older games does not matter since you have either completed the games or will never play them not having beatsaber native sucks unless you use mods/customs songs then you are gonna go pcvr anyway. Waiting a bit longer for the ports it a bummer i agree but i am i mostly using it for pcvr and also for just a media device (watching movies/tv/youtube) is way better than the quest with the improved resolution and clarity. Also using it to simulate a giant monitor for flat screen gaming is actually nice with the improved clarity since text looks so much better and is actually legible now>>><<<Hat hier jemand Germany gesagt>>><<<Dose it have the app <br>big screen>>><<<I might be wrong but I think Nvidia have released an AI module which can the content creators eyes at the camera while they read off a script. 😄>>><<<If you compare two companies Pico 4 is really killer.>>><<<Any thoughts on the enterprise version for PC vr?>>><<<Hey uhhh does it feel like a valve index controller from the straps and the tracking ring?>>><<<I don’t like Meta, but a Chinese mega corp that owns a spyware company (tictok) is definitely worse.<br>I’ll keep my Quest 2 and see what the Quest 3 offers, but won’t be buying from Pico post acquisition.>>><<<As long at is can be used for simple PCVR it&#39;s a shot worth i guess?>>><<<Question: I use an Oculus GO, and I only use it to watch Netflix, Youtube and Prime movies and series.

The both use pancake lenses, and the resolution on the Pico 4 is higher, but reading text, how is that?  I was almost going to buy the quest pro just to use on VR desktop and Immersed but someone on the immersed discord said to look at the pico 4 first.  1/3 the price of the pro seems like it would make it the winner but clarity on computer work is more important to me.  Plus the quest pro has eye and face tracking.  Have no idea what to buy.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=129">2:09</a> what are you playing?>>><<<I hate that all the entry level to mid range VR headsets are made by the scummiest companies I&#39;m not giving Facebook or Bytedance any money nor data.>>><<<Let&#39;s get slightly more serious about PCVR. <br>That excludes the game catalogues. Who wins if I want to use both VR-Headsets with the MSFS 2020? <br>I can&#39;t imagine that the PICO 4 ( without DP/Display Port ! ) still has the edge here. How many FPS are lost when I  just &#39;stream&#39; the simulator? Needless to say, we&#39;re pretty nerdy about counting every single FPS as the demands are already immense. Which VR-Set wins? Honestly, to this day I have NOT received a clear unequivocal answer.>>><<<thak you>>><<<Finally!!!>>><<<If pico had games I&#39;d buy it>>><<<I prefer PN3L over the PN4 for 2 reasons.<br>Displayport (graphics)<br>Brightness<br><br>I prefer the PN4 over the PN3L for 3 reasons<br>Clarity/pancake<br>Motorized IPD (now give us presets pico)<br>Controllers<br><br>A mix of the two above would be INSANE.<br>Im keeping both, for different purposes :)<br><br>PN4, bring to friends for standalone<br>PN3L for graphics PCVR>>><<<Have the pico 4, in Virtual desktop theres an option to connect to your Oculus...now meta... catalogue. I never bothered testing it out, but its there. For oculus/meta users wanting a better headset, that might be a deal breaker is my guess. Test it and make a video? You would be the first :) plus id love a tutorial :)>>><<<I&#39;m thinking that the Quest 2 didn&#39;t came with 120hz so I&#39;m betting that the Pico 4 might unlock it too with future updates.>>><<<5GHz is unstable cause I have my router downstairs ,and my pc upstairs <br>Does wireless only work with 5GHz and doesn’t work with 2.4GHz?>>><<<Really liked how comfortable and self-assured you seemed in this one, not that you didn&#39;t before but I&#39;m noticing more of a subtle confidence to your voice.

Us Europeans need something for ourselves>>><<<had a pico 4, for about a week. for me the most important factor is that the sweetspot and clarity is way bigger. vr usually give me head ache after a while which this also seems to give me. but it´s not that bad compared to others. i believe that it´s because of the sweetspot. where the others had such small spots.  mostly played with the earliest oculus headsett. where i believe that i got right spot on one eye and not the other, making it very straining. If you want to try vr this is just better overall. and primarily if you may have some issues with the eyes. in my case i have classes and my eye are not in perfect line with each other. which makes the sweetspot and clarity more important.>>><<<Nobody ever talks about the fan that the pico 4 has that blows on your face>>><<<how is the battery when doing pcvr?>>><<<PICO did not &quot;decide&quot; not to sell in the US. ByteDance has issues with the US government.>>><<<Good video>>><<<But I read that AR is not stereo wtf>>><<<I&#39;d say the main selling point is AR capability. Everything else is too close to choose the pico over the quest with all the dev support quest gets>>><<<love the pico4 . one of the best headsets on the market for the price. bar none>>><<<Just wondering but isn&#39;t it disturbing when quest 2 has better tracking than this device? I just got the Pico 4 and the hand tracking is slightly better on the quest 2 tbh>>><<<Great review.>>><<<Anyone else noticing glare/internal reflections when looking at bright objects in VR, I read somewhere that it&#39;s normal for these type of pancake lenses? for example, if I hold one of the controllers up to my face (which is white in VR) and slowly move it from right to left, the whole lens shimmers, which I can only describe as the glare you get when a car window hasn&#39;t been cleaned properly.>>><<<if quest 2 still on the price of 299$, quest 2 is the winner, unlike now>>><<<I ordered the Pico 4 the other day and cancel last minute. I have a quest 2 now. My research:<br>Pico game reviews, many people complaining that it’s not as good as the quest 2 version, many saying the quality not as high, or lacking features. Quest 2 has all the same games, plus more. Because Meta bought over gaming companies, giving them exclusive rights to the games. This alone made me choose the quest 2. The Pico 4 is much lighter and better weight distribution, longer battery. But ultimately it comes  down to the games themselves.>>><<<I&#39;m guessing you were lucky enough to get a headset without the len issues? I sent two back because they were useable. Shame as it is an amazing headset.>>><<<I think I’d rather have Facebook spying on me than the Chinese Government.>>><<<My Pico 4 was terrible. Bad LCD mura and very dull colors. Apparently there are real quality control issues...>>><<<This is one of the most honest reviews I&#39;ve seen about the Pico 4. As a Pico 4 owner, I fully agree of what you&#39;ve said. I love my Pico 4, it&#39;s a great device and I have been using it a lot for PCVR and not so much for the standalone titles. <br><br>So for anyone reading this and is looking for a headset to use mainly for PCVR: go for the Pico 4 128GB version. Don&#39;t buy the 256GB model, because I bought it and I have plenty of storage left on the headset because you only need Virtual Desktop from the Pico store to have a great PCVR experience.>>><<<I imagine not selling on the us had a lot to do with the federal government debating a full ban of tik tok in the federation. Why set up a huge distribution and logistics system just to lose it in a few months?>>><<<I noticed that your WiFi network name is the same as mine: Nighthawk. What a coincidence, lol>>><<<I sent mine back and went <a href="http://back.to/">back.to</a> the quest.  Just didn&#39;t like the comfort level and I had my quest 2 pimped out. Plus I found the lenses where constantly somehow getting dirty all the time a problem i never had with the quest.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=71">1:11</a> i see chinese company, i close the video, the only reason im not getting a quest is bcs i value my privacy>>><<<Better wait for the new quest>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=130">2:10</a> yoo what game is he playing on the pico making him do that hand movement damn>>><<<Already?>>><<<BRO PLEASE CLEAN YOUR QUEST 2>>><<<im on my 4th headset with the pico 4, the previous being the quest 2, og vive and rift cv-1. id say for pcvr the pico is better but only for those willing to put in a bit of work. im in na, and imported the headset. a major problem is that apparently some people are not having good experiences due to the lenses or the camera not coming the way it should and not looking how it should, i, fortunately, got lucky with my lenses but not the passthrough with it having a pitch black bar straight through the center of it. aside from this, through VD (virtual desktop) i have found that the pico 4 lasts slightly longer than the quest 2. issue is theres 3rd party addons to fix that and extend it waaay beyond the point of what the pico 4 can provide such as bobovr&#39;s m2 pro/plus. they made an adaptor that i custom rigged to the pico 4 to fix this however. THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR NA BUYERS is that the pico app for me was not available to download on google play, and i instead had to download an apk in order to get the app, after this the setup was fine. (you need the phone app to input a payment method to buy anything on the pico 4 store). another massive issue is the bluetooth audio for the pico 4 is awful. not quality wise, but delay wise. theres around 400ms of delay normally, and you cant plug in a usb-c to usb-c and audio port because for whatever reason, even if your headset that you are plugging in doesnt have a mic, it will try to use it, meaning in VD you have no microphone if you do it this way. this leaves you with one option pretty much, and thats bluetooth headphones to a pc. overall if you are willing to go through the pain of the setup for all of this the pico is much much better, from microphone to lenses, but definately not in comfort suprisingly as it presses too hard on the average persons middle of their forehead.>>><<<I need to mention an extra little detail, and that&#39;s the sound, I think this is a pretty big upgrade to 😊 But spot on with this video 👍>>><<<glad i came across this review, currently have a Rift S, was thinking of getting a Quest 2 or going triple screens as i solely play iRacing with Beat Saber now and again, so seeing you say the Pico4 would be the better option for PC gaming has made up my decision>>><<<nice video,  question if I install elite dangerous on my pc will the pico 4 run that game , I know very little about this stuff this ol` man needs your guidance,  thanks phil.>>><<<quick question if anyone responds: could i buy the $160 5 leg things and assign two for my arms and the rest for my legs?<br><br><br><br><br>Edit: would i still be able to play with my vr chat friends that don&#39;t have beta?<br>also i asked this in the slime video but no-one responded>>><<<This was an extremely well put together Review.>>><<<My IPD is at 61mm and Pico recommends  62-72mm otherwise it might hurt your nose.

I have an ear worm now!>>><<<Regards PCVR . Anyone know how does this compare using Virtual Desktop to the 3 Link with the data cable ? I have a GeForce 1080 TI.>>><<<I went with a Pico 4 mainly for PC VR. As much as I want a proper RE4 in VR (not talking about the upcoming remake that will get mods for sure), the extra comfort of the Pico 4 along with an IPD that&#39;s actually wide enough for me (along with the pancake lenses) were a more important factor for me. It&#39;s a shame we&#39;ll probably never see the original RE4 in VR outside of the Quest. I guess maybe if the Quest 3 is a jump big enough I might get it and actually get to play it, but... that&#39;s not happening until at least late this year either at the earliest.>>><<<Chinese Spybot 2000 no thanks, I prefer Zuckers form of spying over the CCP>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=208">3:28</a> This is how Cineese collects your fingerprints!>>><<<Or pico is not sold in us becaus of the curent legal problems where US was giving them crap for gathering user data through tik-tok and this would be another way they can do this, funy though how when US gather user data its ok but when someon else does it now we have a problem...>>><<<Seems like a very fair review.  I have heard it&#39;s better as a PCVR device from other YouTubers as well.>>><<<I have the Pico 4 and many of my Quest games were also available on the PC&#39;s Oculus app for free as part of cross buy/play. So I did not lose too many of my games. Biggest thing for me is the fact of being unable to join an oculus party, to join friends on their Quest headsets. TRhat is why I kept my Quest 2!>>><<<I share mostly the same opinion after using both the pico 4 and quest 2 for a while!<br>All the games I need except beat saber I own on the pico 4 right now as well>>><<<Bro still playing in 2021 look at the calendar lol>>><<<At the moment the image quality in Streaming Assistant is just terrible. It&#39;s like buying a 4K TV and watching 360p videos on it. No matter which settings you put in RVRPlugin.ini it&#39;s still bad.

Interesting.<br>How does the battery hold up tho? You didn&#39;t talk about that aspect in the video.>>><<<Great fair review. It&#39;s possible to force Virtual Desktop to connect over USB using USB tethering, the performance is extremely good 😉Worth doing for anyone who doesn&#39;t have a WiFi 6 router>>><<<I can&#39;t wait for another year to buy Quest 3 so ima buy a Pico..

I love my Pico 4. After having the Meta quest for 2 years now, its refreshing to have a change. From day 1 of owning the Quest, I have struggled with the display, from god rays to binocular effect and not to forgot the uncomfortable factory issued head strap. Yes over the years Meta has had  update after update making the device improve in performance and display. However, the Pico 4 hasn&#39;t had much updates yet, and I believe in time the Pico 4 will just get better and better. Straight out of the box the Pico 4 immediately impressed me, from the weight of the device and its compact design, to the beautiful lenses that has completely eliminated all the display flaws that I have with the Meta quest 2.>>><<<So if I do yet own a VR headset and I plan to use it for both standalone gaming and PCVR I should get Pico 4?>>><<<play boundry creatied :skull:>>><<<Ayo what was happening at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=85">1:25</a>>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=85">1:25</a> what are you doing there bud?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;I have fought much bigger and worse than you&quot;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=131">2:11</a> &quot;how could you fall to the horney side, those girls are not worth it!&quot;>>><<<how did u play Eco without make a hole on your walls ?>>><<<If I have a Quest 2 and only use PC VR, but I’m waiting for the Quest 3… I shouldn’t get the Pico 4 yet right?>>><<<after going back and fourth a month ago i am SO glad i made the right decision and buy the quest 2. <br>like that my family can play all normal standalone games perfectly fine in their home while i can grab that thing occasionally and crank up settings on 3090 PC here. i love it and for the first time after my rift S i really enjoy VR again. <br>the small advantage in clarity is not enough to buy a pico while quest 3 is around the corner. i will keep the quest 2 for now and when the 3 is out i get that and give the 2 to family forever.>>><<<186th comment>>><<<the problem I have with this headset (and the reason why I didn’t buy it despite being available in my country) is due to the lack of an audio-out port like the quest 2 and even if i were to use it for pcvr, id have to plug my headphones into an adapter for the usb c port, which only leaves me with wireless pcvr which i dont trust to be that smooth at all>>><<<Throw your quest 2 in the bin, the lenses on those absolutely suck and people should stop buying quests until pancake lenses are  released.>>><<<I still can&#39;t get a confirmation on whether the pico 4 can run Bigscreen??    or is it fixed to their version of it??>>><<<So it’s an aftermarket quest pro. Which is cool cause it has the features, but it lacks functionality, the OS is a ripoff and the pc vr pretends it’s a quest. <br><br>I would stick with the quest 2 over the pico 4 for gaming, maybe pico 4 for productivity in that case because of clarity but when gaming the pancake level of clarity is unnecessary. Coming from someone who says the same thing and has a quest pro<br><br>It lacks the finger tracking capabilities, it lacks the 120hz refresh rate which, sure so does the quest pro, but the quest pro is a productivity device, the resolution is higher, however the pixel density is the same.

I made a video about that on my channel.>>><<<Low, very low quality pancake lenses, rhythm games out of sync, occasional stuttering during games....stay away.>>><<<Pico is Chinese. That&#39;s all I need to know. Thx.>>><<<no DP do be cringe tho>>><<<Great info man.  Was wondering about p4 but is it better than the o2 plus?  Ignoring price obviously 😆>>><<<I have to say I like this video more then others as far as comparisons to other videos I’ve watched. I feel it has a more objective view. Other videos focus on the hardware comparison to the quest 2 as far as standalone. New user might find that useful as far standalone but someone who’s already in the quest eco system I doubt will switch due to having to invested in games. As Focus point for a pcvr gaming is spot on in my opinion.>>><<<Nice>>><<<I have an IPD of 72 mm, on the CV1 &amp; the Quest 2 with the prescription lenses installed I can barely play 30min before starting getting headaches and eyes pain..<br>On the Pico 4 I can easily play over 1 hour without prescription lenses installed, this is a game changer for me..>>><<<Pico is a Quest ripoff>>><<<I bought it Walmart online in U.S and im blown away and much better than Quest 2>>><<<Why my passthrough in open brush doesn&#39;t work? It is all black.>>><<<Man you have grown up. I actually liked this video. I subscribed again.....  About the Pico, you didn&#39;t mention it, but the sound from the speakers of the Pico is much better than on the Quest. I play mainly PCVR with it and though I have to turn up the sound to its highest level, it is then loud enough to enjoy playing and I don&#39;t miss a headphone. I have the Quest as my fitness machine and there I like it a little louder and use my earplugs to get that loudness. I like both my headsets. The Quest really riped since its start (just like you did lol), but the Pico has so much potential and I hope they continue improving it.>>><<<I like the scripted video!  Only thing i felt was missing is FOV comparison.>>><<<Does anyone play Rec Room from Pico 4?  I’m curious if it can play the Crescendo quest that has been excluded from the Quest 2>>><<<owning a Quest 2 and Pico 3+4, i actually use the Pico 4 almost every day for PCVR only. But i am also aware of the flaws and downsides of this headset. You can see more screendoor effect on the Pico 4. The controllers need 2 instead of 1 battery and do not have a resting place for the thumb, which makes games like (table) tennis almost unplayable. The image stability of native games is not as good as on the Quest 2. Games like RESIST do stutter in horizontal movement, whereas on the Quest 2 it&#39;s butter smooth. There is some warping visible when you move your head, that can cause motion sickness, although you can get used to it if you are an experience VR gamer. The headstrap is better than the Quest 2, but you cannot mod this one to fit perfectly (yet), since it&#39;s not replacable. You cannot easily plug in a headphone due to the missing 3,5mm jack. Although the image is noticeably clearer the overall image is not very well calibrated, so you can see more light/dark areas and also the image is darker than on Quest 2. But again, you can get used to it. Nevertheles, for PCVR, especially if you can run at maximum resolution, the visuals are clearer compared to the Quest 2 and if you use Virtual Desktop with a good RTX GPU, which can handle fast and high quality HEVC Encoding you can really have a lot of fun with the Pico 4, especially for the low price.>>><<<Black and White stereo passtrough &gt; Colored flat passtrough anytime.>>><<<Thank you so much for this video. It helped me understand the main and most important differences of the Pico 4 and the Meta Quest 2.<br>I will now make an informed purchase in the future (probably the pico 4) :)>>><<<wait, if it can install apks, cant you just download quest 2 game apk and install it on pico? (like gorilla tag apk)>>><<<At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=399">6:39</a> he turns into an ai>>><<<Excuse me what &quot;the vr goblin&quot;>>><<<What happened to the Pimax Crystal coverage that you mentioned like 3 weeks ago.>>><<<<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=131">2:11</a> It wasn&#39;t their decision the US doesn&#39;t want anything sold or something the American people is using to easily be accessed by china to spy and collect data which they already have been caught doing with Tiktok.>>><<<I might pick up a pico4 from eBay cuz I’m in the us>>><<<Major problem for me. Is that pico 4 is my first standalone VR headset. And I found out that games aren&#39;t cross platform.>>><<<Do you have any lens distortion/warping?<br><br>It’s something like this when you move your head.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtxmYRwDaQ0">https://youtu.be/dtxmYRwDaQ0</a><br><br>It’s visible on home environment when you look at the planet and move your head left and right.>>><<<🤔🤔>>><<<So the same company who owns TikTok which is proven to be a ccp spy Trojan horse is the same company who made Pico? Hope it fails.>>><<<my anxiety at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=130">2:10</a> when he was hitting close to that wall is  immeasurable>>><<<The Pico4 was the 1 VR headset i bought (only played PSVR once) i have to say that im more dissapointed than expected, not only because of the headset but also VR in general.<br><br>Regarding the Headset:<br>Lenses are Great (but they seem to catch light or the display is to bright-they glow).Traking seems to be fine. <br>The Display is probabbly fine compared to the rest but the resolution and the Fov is still to low in my opinion.<br>I dont like the shape of the controlers they seem to wanto drop out of your hand, i also miss fingertracking, and those straps so you can let go of them.<br>When i use the rubber nose piece to block out all the light the lenses start to fog up ... ventilation is missing without it its fine.<br>I like the quality of the speakers i think they are ok.<br>Wireless is great i see a lot of potential especially when you use the PC (which i did with a seperate wifi6 router)<br><br>Issues Regarding Games/VR etc. in General:<br>The Home world is a low resulution/quality world, nothing that impresses when you put on the headset (other Homeworlds dont seem to be much better)<br>Standalone Games are on a verry low resolution aswell, even Halflife Alyx streamed from PC with the onboard pico software looks disappointing, aswell as VRChat (maybe thats normal i dont know), ...<br>I think right now standalone is not a good idea and they should focus on pc streaming until the hardware is much stronger<br><br>I feel like you really need some body-Hip Tracking so you can move with that while turning your head somewhere else. (Moving while looking in the direction i want to go seems to me to be the best option right now) I see a lot of problems with the moving in VR i dont feel like the right solution has ben found jet.....<br><br><br>I guess im keeping it for a while to play around but i guess ill have to sell it later because i really have to force myself to use it, there is nothing in VR that really captures me. Everything just seems to be overhiped, i see where it could be but its just not where it has to be i guess in a few Years it might be good enough.<br><br>Sorry for the long rant have a nice new Year>>><<<f no to all  Pico device, dam cheap china knock off>>><<<@TheMysticle i know this is a question completely off topic from the video, but i need help from someone who is big in the vr community, do you know anyone who can help with fbt? i want to purchase slime vr fbt but i dont know anyone who can build them and send them to me internationaly, ive looked and looked and asked but i have not gotten any results, do you know anyone who is able to do that kind of job? 🙏>>><<<Sorry guys. No description, driving 4 hours right now to a light show meetup. I will see you later!>>><<<PICO4 is the best wireless PCVR hands down. Pancake lenses with the higher resolution make it a game changer ... Seeing 75% of your image in focus instead of like 30% with regular lenses is so understated.>>><<<i dont know if this is the right place to ask but people here will know. so i adore my headset it is like my child lmao so im careful with it but ive noticed recently that the side parts with the speaker seem to be warped and cracked in towards the speaker has anyone else noticed this or is it the headstrap im using/am i putting it on wrong. it hasnt affected anything its just a bit aaaaah since no warranty lol<br><br>EDIT: its a quest 2 i forgot to mention this>>><<<Great review! Nicely done 🔥>>><<<Bytedance.Thanks no.>>><<<ill still take quest bc im scared of chinesse cingciangciung>>><<<The Quest is not banned in germany, Meta just doesn&#39;t sell it there. What Facebook did was illegal in Germany, but now they fixed their account bs so have actually no reason not to sell it>>><<<i wish this was available when i got my quest 2, it looks great and i only play PCVR. my only concern was you didn&#39;t like the controllers so much. UPDATE, i sold my quest 2 and bought this and its awesome. I only run PCVR and it looks way better than quest. its not super comfortable facial interface but i think after market upgrades will come to fix that. controllers are just as good as quest IMHO.>>><<<I am continually amazed at your editing skill!  Actually, I&#39;d love to learn how you do some of your production.  Thanks for the review!>>><<<It&#39;s really hard to get used to if you come from a quest The passthrough is a little jank, software is a bit Engrish, and sometimes it&#39;s just buggy. But, on top of all that, pancake lenses. Enough said>>><<<This vid is nice, but I am a cat person so...>>><<<I actually imported this to the US so I could do a Review on it.  Something to keep aware of for US based people who may want to import this,  getting a payment method on file requires the VR assistant which can be found on &quot;other&quot; app stores but not the US ones (at least I wasn&#39;t able to get it) so to get VR assistant on the Pico requires that APK file approach you mentioned.  Not a big deal but something to be aware of.  Also, I was able to screen cast to a browser but not to a phone or smart TV as it says I need that VR assistant for that and like I said, not able to get that off the app stores around here.  May be a work around I&#39;m not aware of.  I don&#39;t know.  Also,  I never bought rechargeable batteries for my quest controllers as those things last AGES in the quest but the Pico 4 burns through controller batteries like nobodies business and I actually got rechargeable for it.  Something to be aware of for those old folk like me who are late to the recharge world lol :)  final thing, I&#39;m pretty sure the Pico wasn&#39;t released in the US because that company owns Tic Toc and there&#39;s a strong push here in the US to ban Tic Toc from the US.  Legislation was passed making it so you couldn&#39;t have tic toc on official devices and there&#39;s a lot of shady things happening with tic toc.  Also, the CCP/China connection and US/CCP relations and all that.  I&#39;m sure ALL that played a role in it NOT coming to the US lol :)>>><<<As someone who typically uses PCVR through a USB-C instead of wireless, I would like the Pico4 a lot more if there was a &quot;OculusDevTools&quot; type thing to edit and raise the encoding bit rate. The good thing about the Quest2 is being able to put encode bit rate to 400~500mbps and it looks a LOT better.>>><<<As much as I despise facebook, I definitely trust them more than bytedance for privacy lmao>>><<<😆 while I am glad you got a free headset, the short answer Pico is no. But I am happy there are more people getting into VR.>>><<<Well, I have a Quest 2 but I think It&#39;s not too much of a difference to switch for a Pico Neo 4 because for me Quest 2 is still better because the most important for me is to see and move well on VR when I use it.<br><br>I still do not have FBT but I would like to buy one that works well and is the most cheaper price possible because I am not going to use it all the time,  just if I needed it.>>><<<hmm, would i be able to use a game apk i pulled off the quest 2 with the adb pull command on the pico 4? maybe you can investigate since you have both headsets available?>>><<<Better hardware means nothing if you can&#39;t run 120hz.<br>You forgot to mention that Eleven Tennis feels like a slideshow compared to Quest.<br>Many reviewers chose to ignore that fact, I wonder why.>>><<<Good video>>><<<Forgot to mention that with Virtual Desktop you can literally play your quest catalogue games!>>><<<best reviee of 2022>>><<<I switched to the Pico 4 from the Quest 2 and the bigger resolution, better lenses and better comfort really makes a huge difference. It brought back my will to use VR. I don&#39;t miss 120Hz at all since my PC can&#39;t even get to that frame rate at decent graphics. You have to take into account that more pixels do hit performance, but for me it&#39;s totally worth it. PCVR works just fine (with or without VirtualDesktop). The standalone catalog does suck by a great margin, and I direly miss having VRchat in a portable device but it&#39;s about it. Apart from that I say it&#39;s worth the switch.>>><<<the part at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVqMq40W-8&amp;t=410">6:50</a> sounds off.<br>is it AI generated, or just a shit mic?>>><<<looking at the pico 4 vs Quest 2, it almost feels like Linux vs Windows.<br><br>One has better performance, and is more &#39;open&#39; in that you can install whatever you want, as long as it&#39;s an APK.<br>One is more locked-down, but better supported, with more features, and is kinda dumbed-down for the general market.>>><<<Weird to say, but i agree on literally everything you said.<br><br>I personally use mine primarily for PCVR, but a little standalone too. Not a single bit of regret getting this instead of quest 2. But some friends who are edging towards getting a VR headset, i have recommended quest 2 instead. Just for the game catalog. You really need a somewhat powerful PC for PCVR, mine is on the edge of not being enough.>>><<<After watching this video, i decided that i will probably get the Pico 4 to mainly play PCVR and do standalone every once in a while. Very useful &quot;reviee&quot;>>><<<👍>>><<<PICO FIX the controller stuttering, it is crazy there are a lot of people with this problem>>><<<If AR improves to the point we can get 1080p recordings without glaring issues or visual artifacts then it would become a great tool for those who enjoy filming! That AR style presentation with text irl was awesome XD We can already do it easily with motion tracking on editing software but it&#39;s always nice to have more options particularly if they become very intuitive. Imagine being able to play with our 3D models or presenting them in our hands through AR as if they were a doll we could move and pose around. We do already have one VR style avatar animator/posing tool which is quite nice.>>><<<Can you play them team beef ports on it yet? Tia>>><<<I think unscripted videos are better cause at some points in the video it sounded like you were a robot>>><<<i am at the moment of typing this, watching on the pico 4, in the USA. I&#39;m upgrading from the quest 1 and I love it. I have PC so I don&#39;t care about the smaller library. I found an APK for the phone app. I think the pico 4 is a great option if you have a PC because it works great with wireless PCVR.>>><<<just got off vr and this was waiting for me>>><<<This is an excellent review, loved the video editing you did throughout and I am a fan of the scripted / professional look!>>><<<Mystical the mythical I am early for once...maybe a pin>>><<<my pico 4 reviee>>><<<I always thought that if i owned a pico 4 i would hit my arm against the tracking ring frequently. i still think that.>>><<<I&#39;ve owned CV1, Rift s, Quest 1 and 2 and I&#39;ve ended up taking long breaks from vr so I end up getting rid of my stuff or upgrading I took a year break so i sold my vr to my friend decided to come back and try the Pico 4 compared the Quest 2 I think it&#39;s a lot better as I play through PCVR and I have a gaming router I have no issues with VirtualDesktop and this is one of best Headsets I&#39;ve ever owned in my opinion only issue for me is the lenses on top are a bit blurry but I dont look up often so it doesn&#39;t bother me that much but i&#39;m really enjoying this headset so far owned it for couple weeks but will give regular updates about headset and how I&#39;m getting on with it also downfall is I cant see anywhere to buy replacement controllers incase I break one but if I do break one and can get one through support i&#39;ll update on that!<br><br>I also much prefer the Pico headgasket compared to the Oculus it doesn&#39;t leave marks or hurt my face.>>><<<Thank you!>>><<<Leg Tracking For Quest 2.

You can know today by judging yourself by God’s standards (The Ten Commandments). Ever lied? Ever stolen? If that’s not enough, Jesus said in Matthew 5:22 that if you hate someone (without cause) you are subject to judgment. And James 2:10 says that if you break the law only at one point , you are as guilty as a person who has broken it all. <br><br>So be honest with yourself. If God judges you on the day of judgement by the ten commandments, would you be innocent or guilty? Heaven or hell? Well, Revelation 21:8 says that all liars will have their part in the lake of fire. <br><br>So how can anyone escape the fires of hell?<br>Well, imagine this: You have a bunch of speeding fines worth 500.000$. You don’t even have a single cent to pay it. Just as you are about to get life in prison without parole, somebody comes in and sells everything he has to pay for your fines so you can go free.<br><br>Similarly, you and I have broken God’s moral law, but Jesus(who is God manifested in the flesh) lived a sinless life, took our punishment on the cross, paying for our sins. Then 3 days later he resurrected and defeated death.

Beside that, i know is a new feature, but also they were working on it for more then a year. For example on December 2021 they told us that would be avaiable in the Pico 3  but then they took really lot lot of time. Also now if you try to work with their library in Unity, most of features are not working.>>><<<The only time I used hand tracking on my quest was so I could flip of my friend 🦆>>><<<Quest 2>>><<<Pico 4 come from China <br>China had copy project from original Meta>>><<<META QUEST! :~))🔥🔥🔥>>><<<Meta quest 2 is better for sure>>><<<Xddd pico 4&#39;s hand tracking is very bad>>><<<Meta>>><<<Meta quest 2>>><<<I think the pico 4 has better finger tracking (you can see its a bit laggy but the fingers are fine) while the quest 2 has better movement of the hand.

About the performance, it was very accurate following my hands, gestures, the movement of each finger... so... I think we&#39;re embarking into an very cool era for Gamers &amp; Developers. <br><br>Nice Short 🎮👏🏻👍🏻>>><<<Pico seems like the better choice honestly>>><<<the hand tracking in your pico is more accurate than the ones in my pico :&#39;(>>><<<people dump on Meta/RealityLabs but these guys are spending big dollars to OUR benefit.

I can excuse the spon because I think you deserve it.  Be objective though.>>><<<For pc gaming you need a wired headset, so for ps5 there is psvr2 and visuals in game are great. <br>But for vr video or flat video pico 4 is the best. <br>Mobile apu for vr are not powerful enough to deliver good visuals at 4k in games. ❤>>><<<There will come a day, when I will be able to rent movies via a headset on day one of their theatrical release. Film studios will still be fairly compensated with my individual purchase. And I won&#39;t have to travel far to my nearest cinema, nor miss minutes of the story when I need to pee. I look forward to this day.>>><<<Had mine a few months now, its an awesome standalone VR unit and even better if you have a powerful pc to hook it up to. <br>Pancake lenses make this very easy on the eyes for me, i also own PSVR2 which is also great but the sweet spot is a bit harder to find with those lenses. <br>Also the little bit of fan cooling on the Pico4 around the eyes makes a big difference but if you wear contact lenses like me they may dry your eyes out a bit. <br>I&#39;ll be looking into prescription lenses for all my heasets soon.>>><<<Welcome to VR my guy>>><<<👎👎👎>>><<<This is the first I’ve heard of this company.

I have both Quest 2 and PICO 4. For now, I&#39;m interested in the color pass-through mode of P4. It feels more &#39;real&#39; than Q2. However, Pancake lenes looks thinner and lighter.>>><<<No vrchat in store no headphones jack you can&#39;t download cracked games for that i will not buy it waiting for oculus 3>>><<<I need my VR device to be light weight! Wanna get one for my virtual world too❤>>><<<If you don&#39;t have pure HW issues with your Pico 4 then it can probably be solved/improved with SW updates in the future. Of course, it is bad and you want to return it. But please give Pico a chance to improve, we definitely need competition in this VR sector. This is the first standalone headset that can actually challenge Meta. I&#39;m neither camp Meta nor camp Pico (have Quest 1 and ordered Pico 4) but if Pico doesn&#39;t get a good feedback then we might never see a Pico 5. And without a Pico 5 Meta can relax again after Quest 3.>>><<<Unlike the Quest 2, without a multi billion dollar company backing it, I dont think this will be a game changer. So for those Quest 2 owners, nothing to worry about, just wait for the Quest 3, not the overpriced Quest Pro.>>><<<I received mine yesterday. I don’t know, I’m not glad of the quality of the view when I move: Quest 2 is less clear, but the image is much more stable.<br>The wifi 6 doesn’t reach the 800mbps and its software looks like a beta. The only reality great thing is the balance.>>><<<hey there!...i am new to Vr industry and i want to buy a Vr headset for myself!...I will only play standalone games but i need good graphics and resolution, standalone games...moreover i dont need a screen door effect and I need a full comfortable headset...so which one should I buy..Pico 4 or Quest 2 with elite strap...I will easily buy an elite strap for me if the option goes for Quest 2..Np for me.<br>.but I need opinions from experts which one should I buy?...Plz reply>>><<<Maybe a strange question, but where did you get the apple &amp; youtube movie apps.... i can&#39;t find them on my &#39;pico&#39;  &amp; also not in the store ?>>><<<This will be my first VR headset. Appreciated your demo of youtube, I hadn&#39;t seen anyone demo this yet.>>><<<Had mine since the 18th. Its a mess. Great optics. Great comford. Headset tracking noticeably &quot;slacker&quot; than quest 2. Comes installed with web apps that make you think various video services are supported but they are not. Getting returned.>>><<<Can you play seated down?>>><<<is it better choice than the cheap hp reverb g2?>>><<<If you have Q2 and gaming PC. There’s literally no need for this headset>>><<<How is it compared to Quest 2?>>><<<your mic is hearting my ear sir might fix it!>>><<<I&#39;m watching 1 review of the PICO4 every day until I get mine :D <br>Congratulations you receive +1 view!>>><<<Except mine has awful mura and needs to be returned :(>>><<<Today I received my Pico 4, but so far it&#39;s a huge disappointment...<br>The most annoying bug is regarding head tracking: if I shake my head quickly, the screen content shakes with my head, it doesn&#39;t stay in one place like on the Quest 2. It seems that the Pico 4&#39;s head tracking can&#39;t keep up with quick movements. Could you please test it for me? Just shake your head quickly left-right, like you were nodding &quot;NO&quot;, and the screen will also shake like an earthquake. Then try it with the Quest 2 - the screen stays in place.<br><br>Here is the complete list of my disappointments:<br>- the face cushion is really hard and stiff, and hurts my head (it also left an ugly mark)<br>- the face cushion lets in light on the sides (it doesn&#39;t follow the shape of my head)<br>- if I attach the extra rubber piece around the nose, the lenses get humid quickly<br>- during the initial setup there was no head tracking until I set up the boundary<br>- head tracking gets lost during quick head movements<br>- wireless PCVR streaming had a decent audio delay (also with Virtual Desktop) - maybe I could correct the delay somehow, I&#39;m not sure yet<br>- the color pass-through is very bad, objects are distorted, some tall objects appear as they were flat on the floor>>><<<Its like Old Nintendo Graphics from Year 2010.....>>><<<I&#39;m completely blind what headset do you recommend and I want one with a good Fov.>>><<<did you notice the wrong world scaling of the Pico 4 in both native and also PCVR mode ? You can see the image warping if you turn your head left/right or up/down. There is a serious error how the image is being processed for the lenses which can damage your eyes. If you monitor horizontal lines when looking up and down you can see bending of these. This should not happen on a headset in 2022.>>><<<I&#39;m importing mine to Australia from Europe in the morning. I already got fully pimped out Quest 2 but I like to own Pico 4 as well. Will get PSVR 2 and Quest 3 when they launch as well :)>>><<<Does it have finger tracking?>>><<<Lovely headset, at 1699 I personally feel it&#39;s reasonably priced too. Good job pico>>><<<Does the vr come with games or we need to buy each of the game?>>><<<Where to get this here in kl?>>><<<i just sell my quest 1 , but i&#39;m not sure if take pico 4 or wait for  quest 3. Sideloading how well work in pico 4 and how many contents can i run on it? I would like see a video on this>>><<<How to connect Pico 4 to TV?>>><<<Very good review.  This standalone vr console is a pretty neat concept but unless it has many new upcoming games then I&#39;m not sure if it would be all that interesting. Looks great for watching movies but the constant head movement would definitely becoming annoying as your screen would shake and turn. In addition it could also cause motion sickness due to the constant movement.<br><br>I guess vr headset is not for everyone.>>><<<Oh my, so fun! Any physical store to try it before purchasing?>>><<<Wow, first vr in malaysia finally>>><<<Finally they enter Malaysia I saw a shop in Sunway pyramid but I think not yet open>>><<<Looks really fun how much is it>>><<<Soooooo another quick question! Have you actually tried VR before? Answer YES/No below! <br>PS: If YES, do share your experience!>>><<<first one 😀>>><<<🔥>>><<<The quest 3 has all of these and is less expensive>>><<<Er so what is the difference after PICO 1, 2 and 3 have flopped?>>><<<just delete this video>>><<<I have a pico 4 vr>>><<<I have the pico 4 since september 2023 and this device has a good price/performance balance if you need a device for steamvr to play your pc vr games. I played many games like jurassic world aftermath, peaky blinders, etc. as stand alone games. Next step is quest 3, but it is not recommended if you need just a device for steam vr. In this case the pico 4 is the better choice.>>><<<Meta 3 be like Im standing right here>>><<<Heh how does it &quot;stack&quot; up against the quest 2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Lens joke>>><<<Quest 3:😒>>><<<I got one for 99 pound>>><<<Quest 3: <b>SUPRISE MOTHERFU-</b>>>><<<Good evening.Awesome,thank you very much.Extremly healthy,forever young,very beautiful,the best of luck,a lot of money,gold,diamonds,prosperity,wealthy,abundance,harmony, happiness and success in your life!🍀🏆💓 *>>><<<someone needs to make a lie counter>>><<<Quest 3 is better lol>>><<<Meta quest 3: <b>*did someone forget me?*</b>>>><<<quest 3: IM BETTER IM STRONGER...
