<<<This is the first affordable Pancake headset and according to reviewers it features bigger FoV than the Quest 2, too bad it's a bytedance product though...>>><<<I'm pretty new to the world of VR, what is the issue with bytedance?>>><<<It's basically Chinese Facebook>>><<<no no no...  its much much worse.   FB at least has US scrutiny now and is being sued up the ass for past mistakes.  Bytedance has no accountability and privacy policy is meaningless.>>><<<Not true, the device is being distributed in Europe and so has to comply with our strict regulations, additionally this headset doesn't require any login.

Edit: it does need a login....

Listen. To be fair, "Requires no social media account" would entail no login to most people, right? Am I crazy for thinking that?

Regardless they were one step ahead of me on this one so it turns out "Pico accounts technically aren't social media accounts"!!!! Sick of this bollucks.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<"here" as in? Gonna be interesting to see how this turns out.>>><<<Chinese companies are famous for obeying regulations!>>><<<EU is famous for bullying companies which ignore the law and has the biggest expertise on this subject. US dgaf.>>><<<Well we are trying to stop Tiktok. Is EU doing that?>>><<<Chinese bots be downvoting you.>>><<<Says the person who's hopelessly pretending that a software update will never come with such a new requirement...>>><<<he lied, it does require login now.>>><<<Not really. EU doesn't dictate what goes on with data on servers in other countries just like nobody really dictates that besides the company itself.>>><<<Which only happens after you log in, Germany in particular ceased q2 sales after the mandatory login was created.>>><<<Companies absolutely build profiles of you without you needing to log in. That’s why stuff like tracking cookies exist. And with that study that demonstrated you only need 5 ~~seconds~~ minutes of head and hand motion data to be able to uniquely identify a person, it’s pretty scary tbh.>>><<<That sounds a bit insane...5 secs of head and hand motion to identify person...can you please point me to that study?>>><<<My mistake, it's [5 minutes](https://www.roadtovr.com/stanford-vr-motion-identity-research/), not 5 seconds. But still pretty insane. Although the possibility for gait biometrics has been known for decades now, and the Chinese government has reportedly already been implementing it since 2018. I think a lot of earlier technologies kind of oversold their accuracy, but they were almost exclusively based on optical analysis. Having direct motion tracker data, not to mention the machine learning explosion that's occurred in recent years, makes the Stanford study totally believable to me (even though their sample size was only 500).>>><<<Ah so the PICO 4 has no login? Didn't know that. That's at least somewhat better. Not sure if that means no online gaming because that would be a problem.>>><<<that little shit is lying.  he must have no idea what he's talking about.>>><<<I should point out that I learned this may be useless, as pcvr seems to require virtual desktop, which needs to be downloaded with an account... So unless you can download with a computer and Usb without an account (which you really should!), this may be meaningless.. apologies for confusion I'm equally confused

Would appreciate if someone could definitively figure out whether Pico 4 allows for external APK downloads>>><<<The reason for quest 2 not being sold in germany was the facebook login.

It was changed from oculus to facebook.

Now that its back to meta account it will be sold again soon.

And of cause you need some sort of account to link purchases and avatar to etc. If you dont want to play alone you need to be able to find friends. So an account is needed at makes sense.

Only suspicion rises due to the fact that pico is a bytedance company.

And there maybe a point to it.

In the end if i buy it i will still surely not be kidnapped, robbed, hacked, or anything else.

Also if I ever visit china they wont greet me by my name and say ahhhh you finaly come over.

They will be able to see my name, birthday, address, and what games i play for how long and so on.

Should I ever need to go to china (likely as i travel a lot for work, but so far not china) they have everything personal anyways.

 
Whats a bit nagging though is that any device with a microphone or camera can give a lot more information if programmed to do so. I guess thats what most ppl are concerned about.

 But im not too sure one is better than the other.

If you are against data collection and want to be safe dont buy any smart things... Smartphone, Smartwatch, Smarthome, Alexa etc.

But having a quest 2, Alexa, Smart Tv,s plus using google without vpn and then fearing the pico doesnt make sense.

I am not that strong when it comes to resisting new tech so im a data bitch... Its ok... 🤣>>><<<They are releasing their product in the most strict privacy law region on this planet, a region where Meta/Facebook can't even sell their devices legally because it already breaks three laws in Germany. Pico on the hand can sell and obligate to EU law.

That makes it a lot more trustworthy than Meta/Facebook products in regards to privacy and other legal questions.>>><<<Please do some research on Bytedance...  you're just making an ass of yourself here claiming they are "trustworthy".   Then come back and make your argument.  I'll wait.>>><<<Dude just spoke to what they knew about the situation and you were plainly rude as a response. Get over yourself.>>><<<They are already more trustworthy than facebook/meta. Don't worry EU will fuck them up should they try something, it's not the US where you can do what you want and just get away with it as a company.>>><<<Woah woah woah chinese paid bot here. The Chinese government told me to tell you that privacy is number 1 priority.  That's why we need your personal information,  it's to keep you safe, safe from our enemies like orange man and randy marsh. Bytedance is simply just a big security network working to keep you safe. Now Have a good day.>>><<<ah, ok. well that sucks>>><<<Yea it’s either Meta sells your data or China sells



Really any other country I wouldn’t care about, but China? Fuck that.>>><<<They own TikTok.>>><<<You could've just said Tik Tok lol>>><<<it's the parent company of TikTok and a chinese tech giant company, and like most tech giants has been involved with questionable practices plus it has close ties with the chinese gov afaik.>>><<<maybe one day we will get a decent budget headset from a not-awful company. probably not though since to release a headset at that price point you kind of have to be a tech giant and as you said most tech giants are at least a bit dodgy>>><<<You don't have to be a tech giant to release at a low price point. You just have to make collecting and selling user data a priority to cover loses on hardware>>><<<Or you have to sell enough software to offset the loss on hardware just like nearly every console in history. It’s not that complicated.>>><<<Nah at the price point the Quest 2 was selling, software sales still wouldn't be enough make up for it. It was estimated the Quest 2 was selling basically at the price of its components so not accounting for labor and logistics costs or the massive amount of r&amp;d Meta has been conducting. Doesn't seem to be much different with the Pico. 

The VR space has way more potential to creep into everyday parts of your life aside from just gaming and we should all be more weary of letting companies like Meta and Bytedance take control>>><<<yeah, they're likely releasing this headset with a subsidized price and planning to gain back profits through their sales on their store.>>><<<Lets not be foolish. They may also sell data or at least use it to advertise something to you.

Question is if this bothers you or not.

Chances that 3 chineese guys come to your house to build a humancentipad are close to 0. But never say never if you agreed to TOS.>>><<<The lynx looks promising

You have to have a Pico account. Also, no login doesn’t mean no data collection. Like, at all. Any marketer will tell you there’s a thousand ways to build a profile on you without an account.>>><<<My personal bias 

Friend of mine is a programmer and was doing a job repurposing drones - they had decided on a certain manufacturer and got a bunch of parts. 

I was at his place and he was showing me all this junk code that was taking gps/pic data and sending it *somewhere* - he was going through and just deleting all of it. 

Also the fact that TikTok is known to take image data and compile it - as well as North American (not just US) ban on Chinese internet infrastructure (and ongoing removal process of any of this existing hardware)

I’m sure at the end of the day there isn’t much I can do. 
Google, Facebook, or PRC - somebody gonna get that data. 

So it’s bias>>><<<Logging in is not a prerequisite for having your data taken.>>><<<yeah between Facebook and TikTok headsets I choose... neither>>><<<I'm just over here waiting for Index 2>>><<<And then we can wait 3 extra years for it to be released in Australia>>><<<yeah it really sucks that it's made by them, it's a good thing the quest 2 isn't made by a social media monopoly-in-progress who will collect every piece of information about you for profit

that'd be crazy>>><<<pick your poison!>>><<<Too bad quest is a Facebook product though...>>><<<What's the difference between bytedance having your info or facebook having it?>>><<<Ones a murderous regime who engages in genocide and oppression of its own people and seeks to dominate as much of the world as it can.

Choose your posion.>>><<<Based on your descriptions, I don't know which one is which.

But I live in the US and not China. So what can China do to me? Nothing. What can the US do to me? Everything.>>><<<But AFAIK, unlike scummy Facebook did in past, this company doesn't require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset.>>><<<Bytedance has no accountability and private information has already been shown to be accessed from China.  This violates most countries privacy laws but unlike FB being evil in the past,  BD is evil in past and now.  Look it up.>>><<<"FB being evil in the past" dude what you say that like it's over with.>>><<<Well now they are paying the piper both  in brand loyalty (see stock decline) and massive lawsuit losses.  So being better now is basically about money and survival in this level of scrutiny.  So if you are suggesting Meta is doing any worse than BD now, i'd like to know what that is...  (honest curiosity)>>><<<Bytedance willingly gives full access to user data to the Communist Party of China.>>><<<&gt; But AFAIK, unlike scummy Facebook did in past, this company doesn't require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset.
 
 
To use Meta headsets, you still need to create a social media account for Horizon with followers/following, etc.  It's just not the Facebook social media, but another new one made by the same company for VR.  You can't have a Meta account without a Horizon social profile.
 
 
Meta are even opening up the Horizon app soon, to allow smartphone users to join this new social networking app and use it without needing a VR device.>>><<<Neither did oculus. Facebook just waited til they got their numbers up then pulled the trigger on data collection. It's very likely bytedance will do the same thing. Considering how much data they get from TikTok it would make sense for them to pull the same thing oculus did.>>><<<Do we know if this has the same power xr2 as quest ? As far as I know it's somewhat heavily underclocked in quest so I'm wondering if pico 4 should have the same performance.>>><<<The Pico 4 should be the same or even better because it has more RAM than the Quest 2. (8Gb compare to 6Gb)>>><<<Better.  The Quest 2 is underclocked because of insufficient cooling.  The Pico 4 runs the XR2 at full clock rate.>>><<<Wow, really ? That should mean good 20-30% perfesnce improvement at same resolution right ? And combined with more RAM, this could be nice performance upgrade over quest2 by the sounds of it.>>><<<Better performance, but it's being consumed by the higher resolution displays.  Which is exactly where I'd like it to be used.  :)>>><<<Not pre ordering anything, I'll just wait till people got actual time on it; I don't trust the wireless vr>>><<<You ever tried a Quest 2 with a proper router set up for it?

Wireless VR works just as well as wired for me but is 100% better IMO, so freeing not having a wire in the way or pulling on the headset as I move/crouch when ceiling mounted.

Plus if I'm just going on beat sabre or something that doesn't need a load of room, I can play in my kitchen without having to move all my settee from living room where I play when I need room.>>><<<I went back to the Index. The delay hurts in multiplayer competitive games.>>><<<I've played on it yes, decent router in the same room still felt a bit of delay in faster songs but it's livable yea

But I'm mostly just not sure about Pico's implementation.>>><<<I found using virtual desktop helped me and you need to make sure (if you didn't already) that the quest 2 is the only device on the 5GHz band. Make sure there's no traffic management on the router as well and you should be good.

I wouldn't say it's 100% perfect all the time, but then cable never was either, at least with my rift. I've never really played quest 2 wired other than quick testing because wireless has always worked so well for me.

I'd be cautious of the pico 4 too though, may turn out to be great and I really hope it does as we need more quest 2 competitors, especially around the same price range.>>><<<&gt;I'm mostly just not sure about Pico's implementation.

For $10 you don't have to worry about Pico's crap software.  Virtual Desktop is in the Pico store and is bulletproof.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if they had some custom low-level software to send data to their servers even without an account, 

The EU has far stricter privacy laws than the US, and they're launching there first.  I wouldn't worry about that.>>><<<When you say wired do you mean Quest wired or a native wired HMD? Just for clarification as Quest wired is far from ideal as well.>>><<<I had a rift originally, quest 2 wireless works as well as my rift did wired. I’ve also tried quest 2 wired for a short time when I got a new router from ISP and wireless started lagging>>><<<Ok I would have to say in that case that, due to the Rifts very aged hardware that your comparison of Wireless VR working just as well as wired isn't completely true.

I can definitely believe it works just as well as wired Quest(I experience the same to the point my link cable is unused for a year) however compared to an Index or any other native wired HMD of comparable quality there is a significant visual difference.>>><<<Not sure which Rift you mean. But I have both and tested Q2 for a couple of weeks. Over Airlink Q2 looks a lot worse than Rift S and maybe a little better than CV1. The res of course is massively bigger than CV1 but compression is brutal. Over USB it looks a little bit better than Rift S but still wasn't worth upgrading.

Now people are saying it's massively better with Virtual Desktop using HEVC compression but unfortunately I haven't tried that.>>><<<I hadn't played PCVR for a while when Bonelab came out and I was really impressed at how good Airlink has gotten. I upgraded to a wifi 6 router last year and it was already good when the network wasn't busy, but now I can play while my partner is streaming TV in the same room and it works great.>>><<<Yeah, that’s mainly because of the optimization and coding work done by meta. Just because it works with airlink and your quest like that does NOT mean it will on Pico.>>><<<it supports cables for link>>><<<I find it amusing that people are buying a headset from a Chinese company because they're concerned about privacy with the Facebook / Meta headsets.>>><<<Quite. Instead of buying a headset where your data is held and sold by a Private Company that has at least a semblance of a responsibility with it, it'll be sent to a Communist Government thats known to spy on its citizens lmao.>>><<<Semblance of responsibility? Jesus Christ, everyone already forgot Cambridge Analytica?>>><<<Well I assume he means that they are one of the most highly scrutinized companies in US now.  They are being sued up the ass for those mistakes.  I think Bytedance simply cannot have the same checks and balances.  US gov pretty much flat out said  stop using their apps due to access violations.>>><<<Exactly this. When stuff goes wrong, both people and the government typically come into play. In China, the court systems are not fair, so you don't need to worry about people, and your basically a direct arm of the government when they want you to be. If your doing something its in their interest, especially if it's something you shouldn't be doing.>>><<<The breach of data caused by a third party app not associated with Facebook, that harvested data participants willingly gave despite it being illegally sold to political campaigns under false pretenses? 

Facebook was fined by the FTC for not doing enough to vet the app in the first place, however they purportedly shut them down when the 'breach' was discovered. There's a lot we can blame Facebook for but this one wasn't primarily on them.>>><<<Cambridge Analytica didn't abuse some obscure security bug. What they did is what they were technically but not legally allowed to do. They violated the terms of service when information was transferred from Kogan's "ThisIsYourLife" app to CA. Kogan's app was however allowed to gather all of this data, just not transfer it to others. According to Facebook's chief security officer at the time, Alex Stamos, “Kogan did not break into any systems, bypass any technical controls, our use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed. He did, however, misuse that data after he gathered it, but that does not retroactively make it a ‘breach.’”   Also not everyone or indeed most of the people willing gave their data to ThisIsYourLife, much less CA.  Their "friends" gave their data to ThisIsYourLife, and it is unlikely their friends understood the extent of the data being given to ThisIsYourLife.  Facebook was exceptionally sloppy with user data and actually advertised that sloppiness to other companies.  It's not like ThisIsYourLife was the only one hovering up user data like this.  It was an advertised feature of the platform for crying out loud!  We can completely blame Facebook for companies using features of Facebook's platform that Facebook openly advertised.>>><<<Cambridge Analytica was not a Meta company>>><<<Did CA actually break any laws? I thought part of what made that whole thing horrifying was that it was all legal. That's the semblance of responsibility. 

Only illegal thing I recall is providing services for free so as to avoid going over campaign spending limits, and even that's a grey area. Immoral for sure but, not illegal. 

I could be totally wrong and would happily be corrected on this, it's been a while since I thought about this stuff.>>><<<Nobody said anything about legality. It's irresponsible to leak all that data.>>><<<That’s the thing. It wasn’t really leaked. It was legally given.>>><<<"semblance of responsibility" that's a good one.>>><<<The US government has access to the data of US companies. So your comparison is wrong. Either compare company to company or government to government. Don't mix apples with oranges.>>><<<Don't be naive Bytedance is selling your data to advertisers too.>>><<<I guess I could see the logic in saying that it’s less likely to be a problem for you personally to have your data controlled by a foreign government than the one of the country you live in, because that foreign government doesn’t have any jurisdiction over you.>>><<<Not sure I follow your logic. You don't think they'll sell your data to anyone who wants it like US companies do?>>><<<Not to be a contrarian, but what does this realistically mean for the average Joe? My life is not that interesting.>>><<<Absolutely nothing except you might get a scary negative number next to your reddit comment>>><<<Nothing at all. I don’t really bother about this stuff either. 

For some people it’s just a matter of privacy though. It wouldn’t ruin your life if someone took a video of you taking a shit and put it on the internet for all to see, that doesn’t mean you’d be happy for people to film you in the bathroom though.>>><<<I’d buy it if it was in the US. I have a Quest 2 and a Valve Index. I’m just going to use it with Virtual Desktop on Steam anyway. The hardware is better than anything Meta has out right now at the price point.>>><<<Absolutely understandable to be weary of fb and/or bytedance, however I don't like the gatekeeping that goes on in this sub. If people don't share your concern about it, then that's totally fine and you shouldn't be looking down upon them. 

Let people enjoy what they want.>>><<<It’s quite the thing to behold, really. As if a login changes the data collected or prevents them from knowing everything about you and everything you do.>>><<<As someone else pointed out, though, and I have to agree on this point... EU privacy regulations are *quite* strict and the PICO has to comply with them to be sold. So you're actually safer with any headset in Europe as opposed to any headset in the US. They do it right over there.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Username checks out>>><<<You dropped the r/>>><<<The only thing that stops me from ordering it is the lack of DP connection.>>><<<Double penetration?>>><<<Hope you have your DP cable at hand for the session. 🤣>>><<<It when you need to connect both displayport and USB cables, not All in one cable.>>><<<Youre into some freaky stuff bro>>><<<Cool, Instead of letting Meta spy on me, I'll let the CCP spy on  me.>>><<<Eh, I already have TikTok gathering all that info on me anyway>>><<<That sucks.>>><<<When I said I wanted more affordable VR competition from other companies,  I did NOT mean Bytedance!!!!  lol>>><<<i mean, who else could do it?

Google barely put any effort into it and failed

Apple is still working on it, and the first generation will probably be expensive and who knows if they’ll even have traditional controllers or let Virtual Desktop into the App Store?>>><<<I know right :P but this headset would cost around £800-£1200 without data collection>>><<<It's bad enough letting Fuckbook into my home, no way will I let the CCP in.>>><<<Is it possible to play games from the Oculus store on this headset?>>><<<Only Oculus PCVR games and only through 3rd party software

This is the correct answer on all gen 1 hardware, all the time.>>><<<I wish we could just discuss the hardware. Everything I've read/watched points to this being an awesome headset. 
The only thing stopping me is I want more MR features which this doesn't appear to have due to the lack of 3d pass through and depth sensor.
Otherwise the weight and balance of it is so enticing. I'm sick of cumbersome bricks on my face and the rumours of the next Quests still having the battery in the front with the soft strap is so annoying.>>><<<This is exactly why I'm giving it a try :D and I'm coming from Quest 1 which is particularly brick-like XD>>><<<Ah, sweet. Another device that is cheap only because of data that will pay for it all on its own.   


Even if you don't need to make an account, if it requires internet access, then it can begin to start profiling you instantly. That's pretty crazy when it comes to a device that can track your movement &amp; got multiple cameras that detect the local area nearly all around it. Also, it's apparently by a Chinese company. So sheesh. Facebook ain't no saint, but the US govt is pretty upset with them. Meanwhile, China would praise this company for taking data from its consumers and not give a shit what happens to said data afterwards.   


And for anyone who says "But they can't do that!" They don't care. They will also attempt to hide its activities by detecting when it's being monitored, and shut off the collection processes. This behavior has been observed in a Chinese app before. So I wouldn't be surprised.>>><<<If you only intend on using this for PCVR you don't need internet access other than upon first use when installing updates. After that you can completely disconnect it from the internet and only connect to a router hooked up to your pc for VD or air link streaming. This doesn't give the headset any internet access AFAIK.>>><<<Or with some routers you can use parental control and whitelist a random website entirely unrelated with Bytedance,
or outright block the internet.

At least TP-link routers still allow you to connect locally even with both of those being used.>>><<<Why are half the posts here taking about data collection XD

People were mad at Meta because they combined their VR device accounts with their social media accounts (which is stupid for many reasons) not because of data collection

Almost every electronic device you own is collecting your data and most of them are made/assembled in china XD>>><<<Most of them are made and assembled there but not owned by a company there that reports its data back to the Chinese government. And if you think the data coming from a tied social media account wasn’t the concern, then, well, I have a Chinese government to sell you.>>><<<The tied social media account WAS the concern?

Data collection IS a privacy problem, The point I'm making is you cant get away from it unless you do not buy most modern technology>>><<<Not just any Chinese company. ByteDance. The company behind TikTok…>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I swear society is getting paranoid.>>><<<For good reason. The data they collect is what feeds the AI learning algorithms which will ultimately decide the fate of nations in the coming century.

Sounds crazy, but that’s the era we’re living in.>>><<<Oh no! They're going to make advertisements that work better! All of you have reddit accounts. You think this isn't scrutinized? You think every single Google search you do isn't scrutinized? None of you have ever in your lives read the terms of service.>>><<<Go ahead and give China more ammo against us. Chinese oppression is a bit different than the useful products Google uses our data for.>>><<<Quest 2 to undo recent price increase?>>><<<bro people here are way too paranoid lmao y’all gotta chill out with ya tinfoil hats>>><<<I don't get what's the big deal with them taking my data

Unless it comes back to me in the form of ads I don't really care if they use my data to feed any sort of ai like wtf are they even gonna do with it yall making it seem like I'm contributing to the construction of a doomsday machine>>><<<For real. Like, I may be wrong but what the hell is a chinese company gonna do with a US citizens data that isnt ad/marketing purposes?>>><<<Nice price but I can’t spend another 370 euros after 2 years with so little quality vr content around.>>><<<The trick is to buy a better headset then replay every game you ever liked to see all the texture detail you missed out on the first time XD>>><<<I did exactly this with half life 2 for a decade between 2004 and 2014. Now let’s do the same with alyx!>>><<<I'll keep an eye out then. I'm hoping for a standalone Valve headset at some point so I have an easier time with Steam.>>><<<Fucking hell that's cheap>>><<<the competition has arrived!>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I will be exclusively using this for PCVR over WiFi with Virtual Desktop ;D>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yeah man! That's literally it :)

  
Once you load into Virtual Desktop there's even a button in the system that says 'Launch Steam VR' and it does it for you :P>>><<<Honestly I dont know either but im hearing good things from news and reviews

The headset is cheap enough for me to take a chance on it ;)>>><<<Fairly seamless, open vd on pc, open vd on headset, hit "launch steamvr".>>><<<Yep, it's that easy. Virtual Desktop has a streaming app you launch on your PC and it gives your headset full access to your desktop.>>><<<I have the quest 1, how is this an upgrade and is it a lot better? Also does it connect to my pc?>>><<<Ah another Quest 1 connoisseur XD

\- XR2 chip (same as quest 2, should feel a lot more snappy)

\- Pancake lenses (significantly smaller size and weight, bigger sweet spot, fewer god rays)

\- Greater than 2160x2160 LCD displays (so much more than quest 1, will see a lot of detail you couldn't see before)

\- WiFi 6 support (should be better for pc connectivity)

I understand that wired PCVR will be an option but wireless through Virtual Desktop will be preferable (especially because it will allow you to play Oculus PCVR games without REvive)

One negative is that the headset is LCD not OLED so black levels are a bit of an unknown for me but I'm willing to take a gamble on it for the other benefits ;D

EDIT - I forgot the 90hz XD Quest 1 can only do 72hz, games should feel more fluid and "real">>><<<If you own a quest one it will be a night and day difference.

2160x2160 resolution is noticably better.

Connection to PC only via virtual desktop. Or a dongle that will be released next year.There will be NO cable connection. (think I heard somewhere USB-C may follow bbut not sure)

First reviews say streaming with virtual desktop works very well.

However if you are into racing sims or flight sim you should wait for further reviews on latency. For games like alyx I think there will be no issues. Except if you cannot accept some compression for the signal. If you NEED cable this HMD is not for you unfortunately.>>><<<Better tech that quest 1, better visuals.

You just gotta hand over your data to the Chinese Communist Party.>>><<<Anyone wanna tell me what’s the reason people are afraid of it?
Are people scared of it like they are scared of Facebook and tik tok or am I missing something?
Cause I ligit wanna get it because it lighter than the quest two wich means I don’t have to buy a head strap on top of buying the headsetXD>>><<<Funny how oblivious these comments are, most seem to think Europe doesn't have the data protection act... And also they think any useful data is extracted when you don't even have to login 😂😂..>>><<<Funny how ignorant people are when it comes to how data collection works, it's even funnier if you think the CCP follows or cares about EU rules.>>><<<Dude. Location data. App data. Playtime. Times of use. Everything you click on and how long you stay there. Not having a log in means jack shit to having a user profile full of data about you.>>><<<Exactly, the device could have an unique hardware id like a Mac address and that's more than enough for data collection and grouping>>><<<People really out here thinking you can't build a user profile without a login. Sweet summer children, research 'device fingerprinting' to get an idea>>><<<The day after I pre-order via SystemActive... DOH!>>><<<I also pre-ordered through Bestware. Amazon seems nicer due to 30 days return and maybe better handling of shipping.

However I believe it will arrive same day +- 1.  


So no reason to cancle and reorder over amazon.>>><<<I won't be canceling. Given the choice I'd have ordered Amazon tho to make use of my Prime sub, their logistics and avoid the risk of delay due to postal strikes or Evri's incompetence. And I have more confidence of Amazon's return and replace being quick should I need it. I'm sure SystemActive will be fine, I've just no personal experience of their service.

Amazon weren't listed as resellers on Pico's website yesterday.>>><<<Same here, Im sure Bestware is cool but would also have liked to stick with what I know.  


I thought Amazon orders would only be up after release.  


Ill have a sleep about it and maybe cancle at bestware lol :)>>><<<Nothing in the vr gaming world right now that could make me buy this.  I'm wait for the next gen. I have my rift cv1 , quest1 and (2) quest 2s still. Good enough for a bit>>><<<Is this the one with no headphone jack?>>><<<Headphones can be connected to the USB port via adapter, not great, but better than nothing.>>><<<XD yeah it is>>><<<Pico 4??? What happened to Pico 1??

I've been really out of the loop.>>><<<Sucked, sucked, ok, and now the big jump>>><<<Thank you, ordered, and now to cancel it on Bestware. Cheers.>>><<<Everyone complaining in the comments about owning byte dance products as if they don’t use tik tok>>><<<I don't use tiktok, reddit is enough, on tiktok I saw only a constant flow of stupidity.>>><<<As someone who recently got one I can tell you why: it's the cheapest headset for third world countries. I had to import one from China and I live in Brazil; for the price of one single Quest 2 you can get two Pico 4 and you'll still be left with some money to buy some games. To give you some idea, the Quest 2 costs around 4 months of minimal salary, the Valve Index costs more than a year.>>><<<Honestly this is pretty interesting. Was pretty much the same in south Africa. Quest use to be about 3 times msrp. No support for quest in South Africa. So had to do via 3rd party. Bit the bullet and have had my quest for almost 2 years.>>><<<That's really sad. The whole metaverse thing Meta is trying to do will never happen if people can't put their hands on a headset. I see a bright future for virtual reality but for that to happen it HAS to become more accessible. I live in Brazil and this kind of technology is reserved only for the riches, at least for now. I was lucky enough to buy the Pico 4 from China without taxes (which can be 60% or more of the declared value). I bought it so I can expand the kind of experiences I can develop at work.>>><<<and, it's also much better hardware>>><<<As someone who recently got one I can tell you why: it's the best i troduction to VR HMDs. Coming from the index, it's just so much less work to make the setup run, to position the hmd correctly, to show other people, to get no nausea, to set the ipd, to get into the sweet spot and you don't have a cable and access to 4 stores, the pico, the sidequest, steam and android apps in general (not sure if cardboard games run).

It just delivers. The store needs some polish only a couple native games that use the resolution but when they do it looks great.>>><<<🙋🏽>>><<<I live in a third world country as well but Pico 4 is roughly the same price as Quest 2 if not slightly cheaper, the price difference I can find is just as much as \~US$30 cheaper with limited availability and to import something like that isn't an option here.>>><<<in germany the quest 2 is actually 25€ cheaper then the pico>>><<<for real?!  Bruhhh I wasted 3 mil reales in my Quest 2 through Amazon Brazil>>><<<Wow dude your country sucks>>><<<Prolly cause nothing else of note released? Based on the reviews I've seen of the product, its not because its outstanding or anything. 

Its because its new?>>><<<PCVR is starved for a new headset.  If Sony made PSVR2 SteamVR compatible I think we'd see pretty high adoption rates on PC.>>><<<Sony is probably selling the PSVR2 at a loss (Standard for consoles, they nearly always sell at a loss and make profit off games.)

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I'm not sure how much there selling it at a loss for, I'd be fine paying $850 for a headset similar to the PSVR2 on PC>>><<<Yea I'd pay that for an oled 4k headset with eye tracking without even second guessing it.>>><<<&gt; Sony is probably selling the PSVR2 at a loss (Standard for consoles, they nearly always sell at a loss and make profit off games.)

Sony doesn't do that. They don't have to. Sony has been selling every PS4 at a profit for years. They sell ever PS5 for a profit now.

The PS5 sold for a loss at the start, but once the sales/production chain smooths out they don't. They've been selling the PS5 for a profit for over a year now.>>><<<They always sell for a loss at the start. PSVR2 isn't out yet. It will probably be selling for a loss in February, so of course Sony does that. They don't aim to ALWAYS sell it for a loss. If you're selling for a loss it's hard to make it up in volume. Even Facebook seems to have given up selling the Quest 2 for a loss. I'm sure it's much cheaper to make AND they jacked up the price by $100.>>><<<&gt; They always sell for a loss at the start.

Read my post you replied to and I went through all that.

Also if you bothered to read the post I responded to, that poster was just parroting the standard line that console makers sell consoles at a loss period. Not just at the start. And make profit by selling games. For example Microsoft has to do that.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/shopping/xbox-series-x-consoles-sold-at-a-200-loss-says-phil-spencer/ar-AA13vRnA

Sony doesn't need to do that. Sony makes money on the consoles, the games and the accessories.>>><<<Yeah, I noticed you completely contradicted yourself. You said Sony doesn't do that. Full stop. The truth is they totally start every generation like that.>>><<<Yeah, I noticed that you don't know how to read. Full stop.>>><<<It's inevitable that we will get a new Valve headset. I mean they only run the only damn PCVR service besides what Oculus?>>><<<For Germany specifically, it's the *only* low-cost VR headset on the market. WMRs, RiftS and Quest1 went away some years ago, G2 never got cheap and Quest2 was never released.

In terms of price/performance, it's also the best headset on the market right now, being both cheaper and better than the Quest2, at least in terms of hardware, software still needs a bit to catch up, but that's not an issue when used for SteamVR.>>><<<so people are basically using the pico 4 as an airlink type headset, using it exclusively for PCVR where the software problems dont exist?

gotta say, that doesnt seem like a terrible idea, if the headset is good and light.>>><<<Yes, I use it like that>>><<<Would you say it’s a noticeable improvement in experience over other headsets like the quest 2 or rifts or whatever?>>><<<I was an early adopter in VR with DK2, Rift and Quest 1, but the pico is by far the most comfortable one in terms of balance, weight and it has a great visual clarity. The facial cover was a little stiff at the beginning and the blacks could be way darker, but all in all it was a big step up for me and for the price a no-brainer.>>><<<That's how I use the Q2. and vrdesktop is on pico as well!>>><<<Wait, what? The Quest 2 was never released *in Germany*?

Wow, that explains why it's cheaper in brick and mortar stores than on amazon here (Austria).

Do you know the reason? And the reason 3rd party sellers didn't take the opportunity to fill the lack in supply?>>><<<Its because it is an upgrade in resolution, and most importantly, lens clarity at the edges, form factor, ergonomics, at a cheap price.

PCVR owners looking for the next cheap upgrade are buying it.

It is below average in other areas, compared to Meta headsets, like screen brightness, software features, store library.

That, and there is nothing else. Lol.>>><<<You could call anything new the 'fastest growing' that's a really loose wording that could mean so many different things. "My new headset sales are up 300% since last week when I only sold 1" it could just be numbers of new purchases which just really means it's the only new cheaper thing selling now like you were saying.>>><<<Pico 4 is an amazing PCVR headset, easy to talk down something you’ve “prolly” never tried>>><<<It has better visuals than reverb g2 and costs 450€ so it's a quite nice headset. I only use my rift s for sim racing anymore, for everything else pico 4 over vd. And the freedom of movement is a big plus there>>><<<&gt;It has better visuals than reverb g2

lol no>>><<<I just picked up the the Quest 2 Resident Evil Bundle + elite strap for £330 new.  If the Pico 4 was cheaper I'd have got that for sure.

Only bought one as all the reviews kept telling me there was very little difference between the two headsets, there are exclusives on the Meta platform, I wanted a PCVR headset that could be used totally free and with Steam so I could play Alyx and I kept being told the next big leap in Steam compatible separate headset is over a year away at least (and will cost more and with scalpers be stupidly hard to get)

Also I've never tried VR before so if it's going to make me nauseous I want to find out  before I pay a lot of cash.  I just wanted the cheapest way to play Half Life Alyx and some stuff on Steam I got from a humble bundle.

When Valve bring out the next headset I'll get one for sure but I want it to be PC and non PC.>>><<<The reviews are mixed because its hardware is brilliant, 4k while still fast but it’s hardware also brings it down. Games are unlikely to be optimised for the pico 4 because it’s a lot of work, this makes a lot of textures stretched and off>>><<<All the way up to 0.67%!>>><<<yeah but it's not counting anyone using virtual desktop yet>>><<<Now sure what the analysis is here. The Quest 2 achieved 41% market share in 12 months. It's fair to assume that it has reached a plateau, and that any new headset that is not a complete flop *should* grow faster.

But there is fast and fast, and those numbers actually look quite bad for the pico. The pico took 0.5% of the steam userbase in November, the quest 2 lost 0.4%. At that rate, it will take more than 40 months before the pico overtakes the quest 2. That's more than 3 years, and meta has time to launch 1 or 2 new entry-level headsets in that time.

On the other hand November is not usually a very fast month for purchasing toys, and the US market is missing. The figures for December and January will be more interesting.

(The bit about virtual desktop is also interesting, but it means that the numbers are basically useless, so I'm choosing to ignore it. Again, future data will be more usable.)>>><<<Also wanted to note that the way I understand it. Guy Godin developer of virtual desktop. Said that virtual desktop shows up under quest2. So people running the pico 4 with VD will show up under quest 2. In steam vr. Essentially giving it wrong statistics. I might be wrong here. I read something along that line.>>><<<Yes that's what I understood too. So until that's fixed, the statistics are virtually useless.>>><<<I think it's really hard to make a clear analysis when the HMD isn't even available in the US market. But it's nice to see competitors are trying and got some success even in a limited range. The Pico 4 is a great product for it's price, better value than Quest 2 for sure in terms of hardware.>>><<<Hardware good but I head everything but display port is dog shit. Connection wise>>><<<I’ve had no problems once I got past APK region locks. In fact, using the Virtual Desktop app (not native yet rofl) the connection is more stable than Oculus Link. The controllers recently got better tracking from a firmware update also, now matching Meta in reliability. The headset is half the weight with a better fan, and the lenses have .5mm intervals for PID adjustment further than even their published range, meaning I no longer get motion sickness. Absolute game changer for me.>>><<<I’m just talking visual quality. As well as less nits>>><<<Not quite sure what you’re referring to with visual quality, unless comparing air link vs displayport. Same compression as the other air link. And with nits, man even 20% brightness is plenty for me personally, the Quest I have lower than even that usually lol>>><<<The nits have to do with how much light teachers the eyes. And it’s even lower than quest 2 and quest 2 can be low. Overall it’s an ok product for what it is. Leaves a lot to be desired though. Good competition for meta is why I hope it does well.>>><<<He means that the Pico 4 isn't as bright as the Quest 2>>><<<Sounds like a paper spec, low number bad. My experience has been dramatically better in every way regarding the display, and brightness has never been a thought. Maybe I need to compare side to side again>>><<<Side by side it's pretty clear that the Quest is brighter, the Pico image kind of looks desaturated>>><<<I think it is just a marketing campaign by pico. Dont forget who owns it lol>>><<<Accurate IPD adjustment by .5mm + no fresnel distortion + better fan + half the weight + less chromatic aberration 

Cured my motion sickness and more than tripled my VR legs overnight. Vr gaming is now actually possible for me, which legitimately couldn’t happen on Quest 2 limitations for longer than 30min.>>><<<Well deserved, currently the best value for PCVR it seems :)

And so good to see some real alternatives in the market to prevent us all from getting locked into walled gardens...>>><<<I don't really see how Pico is less of a walled garden than Meta. When connecting to a PC they both have no walls. And when standalone they both have their store and they both support side-loading.>>><<<Yeah I never got this concept.the quest and every oculus/meta headset has always allowed you to connect to PC and use steamVR. If you don't want to use Oculus's store, you don't have too. That's why I've always thought the "Apple" comparison was silly, because meta actually allows you to download third party apps and use third party stores. Apple doesn't.


People want to complain about meta's data handling and privacy practices, that's fine.

But also it's not like Pico isn't owned by a large Chinese corporation that owns Tik Tok, which has been known to share data to the Chinese gov.

That's what's wild to me. Pico and Meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults, but people have embraced Pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same.>>><<<I agree that it's stupid to go with the Pico 4 if the reason you choose not to go quest is because of data and privacy issues.  They both equally suck ass in that department.  I think what got people going Pico was that it's the closest quest competitor and doesn't require an account just to use PCVR.  Now I still wouldn't allow that device on my wifi network without seriously locking it down lol.>>><<<&gt;I think what got people going Pico was that it's the closest quest competitor and doesn't require an account just to use PCVR.

That's the part that nearly got me to buy one.>>><<<Yeh never gotten this issue. I use native quest cable link and air link to play PC VR Steam games via the official link program amazingly well with no issues on my Quest Pro. Additionally I can use Virtual Desktop if I wish to. The oculus store is 100% optional for tethered use where as every other pure tethered headset you require a PC. The Meta Quest and Pico are just better giving flexibility for solo and standalone options along with giving the same or better actual performance. Vive tracking is wank, Valve Index res is bad every setup has downsides and upsides. It all just seems like a big patch of sour grapes from people not wanting to pony up money for new headsets.>>><<<Nevermind that the board of that company has many Chinese govt officials on it so they can do whatever they want with our data if they chose to.>>><<<&gt; But also it's not like Pico isn't owned by a large Chinese corporation that owns Tik Tok, which has been known to share data to the Chinese gov.

And US companies share data with the US government. Which is why Europe ruled against Meta on data privacy. Which is why the Quest 2 isn't sold in Germany. The Pico is though.

&gt; That's what's wild to me. Pico and Meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults, but people have embraced Pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same.

&gt; That's what's wild to me. Pico and Meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults, but people have embraced Pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same.

Yes they are the same. Both US and Chinese companies share data with their respective governments. Until Meta accounts though, Pico had an advantage in that in doesn't know who you are. They don't even ask for your name. Anonymity is generally good for privacy. But with Meta accounts, you can now give them a fake name. Since positive ID is not a requirement for a Meta account. Well unless something goes wrong with your Meta account and you need to recover. Then it'll be tricky if you gave them a fake name. With Pico, they never had your name to begin with.>>><<<&gt; Yeah I never got this concept.the quest and every oculus/meta headset has always allowed you to connect to PC and use steamVR.

That's because you're not remembering it correctly. Oculus never made their headsets work with Steam VR. Valve instead made SteamVR work with Oculus headsets. Just like Virtual Desktop made it possible for the Quest headsets to stream PCVR and, due to demand, Oculus/Meta eventually released Airlink. 

Oculus has been attempting a closed ecosystem since day 1 of the Oculus store. But the community has been 1 step ahead of them every time.>>><<<I am remembering correctly because I have owned every Oculus Headset since the DK1(except the pro) and worked in my colleges VRLab around the time that the vive was released for 2 years.

Valve made the SteamVR api compatible with Oculus **before** the vive was even released. Literally like the week before. The reason Oculus had not done that yet at the time, was because they were one of the only Consumer VR options up until the Vive, outside of a couple open source headsets that were basically just copies of the DK2.

That's not even taking into account the fact that up until the Vive and then the oculus touch controllers, no headset really offered motion controls outside of either modding PSEye wands to work(which I did in my colleges VRLab and it wasn't pretty) or using the Razer motion controllers(I forget the specific name).

So yes, Valve made the highest selling consumer grade Headset at the time compatible with their newer ecosystem. It's not like that wasn't beneficial to valve at all 🙄.

Also airlink had already been in development for awhile, and it's not like Oculus sent them a cease and desist and made them take down their application. You can still use it, oculus just made their own protocol after seeing people clamoring for it.

The ONLY time that oculus really went the "closed ecosystem route" was by shutting down vive port which allowed SteamVR headsets to use the oculus store.>>><<<&gt; So yes, Valve made the highest selling consumer grade Headset at the time compatible with their newer ecosystem. It's not like that wasn't beneficial to valve at all 🙄.

The highest selling consumer headset at that time was the HTC Vive. Rift launched with an Xbox controller and as forward-facing-only experience, it was essentially a joke until they introduced Touch, added support for more cameras and cut the price in half. The whole Rift launch was a complete rushed mess trying to play catch up with Valve's new headset.

&gt; The ONLY time that oculus really went the "closed ecosystem route"

The issue is that Oculus never had an official way to get third party headset into their ecosystem. Not back then, not now, you have to use hacks.  Worse yet, they can't even manage to support their very own headsets properly. Rift has always been locked out of Venues. Quest1 got locked out of Horizon. Go was abandoned and forgotten. Horizon is also still region locked to hell. 

I recommend reading [Zuckerberg's leaked 2015 email](https://www.scribd.com/document/399594551/2015-06-22-MARK-S-VISION), Oculus/Facebook/Meta being a bit more locked down than the competition is no accident, *it's the whole point of them being into AR/VR*. Zuckerberg sees AR/VR as the next big computing platform and he wants to control it, which is something he failed to do in the smartphone space where Google and Apple control everything. The only way he can fix that is by controlling whatever technology comes after smartphones.>>><<<I was referencing pre vive. Before the Vive even launched they made the CV1 and previous Oculus headsets compatible with SteamVR. At the time the CV1 was the highest selling consumer grade Headset.

And yes they do not allow other headsets onto their platform. They are taking the apple approach of closing off their own ecosystem, which has it's benefits and detriments (by turning people off to the platform). The difference between them and apple is they do allow third party apps and allow their system to work in other ecosystems.>>><<<they are basically the same in that respect ... I actually think that Facebook is doing a very good job for us all atm ... what I mean though is that attractive alternatives will prevent a platform to get too dominant and e.g. be able to limit usability of Steam, Sidequest or other 3rd party platforms>>><<<I agree, I think accessible prices will allow for a better insertion into the market and exponentially motivate a larger amount of developers willing to contribute to the growth. It seems to be a controversial opinion at the moment, but personally I think Meta is correct in regards of VR/AR being the next step for gaming, enterprises and social gathering. It is a technology that has several different branches and that usually helps sedimentation.  
  
30 years ago no medium-small company had a website and saw no need for it, nowadays even my florist has a website - I think metaverses are ought to go somewhere in some shape or form>>><<<You said it right. 

Everyone likes to look back on the internet in the early 90s with rose colored glasses. Of course there were some good things about it, but the majority thought it was useless and a waste of time. “Why should I use ‘email’ when we have a perfectly good postal service?” 
Not a direct quote, but you get the idea. 

Wall Street also downplayed its significance before and after the dot-com bubble (denial, hype, cynicism). We can see parallels between the present and back then. There was the initial denial period of the tech even being possible.  We just went through the AR/VR/“Metaverse” hype and bust, and we are now in the cynical phase. 

People always expect instant results on technological advancement. It feels like the “metaverse” is what the internet was in ‘95. These things take time.  Before we know it, this tech will be everywhere and people will wonder what life was like before XR.>>><<<As a similar analogy to yours, just 20-25 years ago when the first consoles were coming out, you had to be either rich or lucky to have one, the choice of hardware and software was very limited and having someone to play online was a pipe-dream.
Only a few years later, consoles evolved into playstations, xboxes, nintendos, etc the market was flooded with choice, the prices were stable enough for mass adoption - and of course, it was fun - nowadays everyone has some sort of a console in their homes.  
  
The ball is rolling, and like it or not Meta is a billion dollar company who seems to be going all in into it, so I'm expecting at least a small impact on the medium-long run. I wouldn't say they are jumping too early into it, I think they are just paving and enlarging the path using their own corpses in hopes of reaping some dividends down the line.   
But overall I think Meta does know that this future is going to be shared with many other giants, they are trying to sediment their layer as early as possible>>><<<Good point>>><<<I think it's more about variety and not being at a mercy of a single company>>><<<&gt; mercy of a single company

Valve is a single company.>>><<<Just because you like the company, doesn't change the fact that monopoly is still bad.

Of course its not a binary case, it depends on what we're talking about and in case of something like steam it may be quite different.

And yes I know that there are multiple companies making VR, but in terms of cheap, decent, standalone VR, until Pico it was pretty much only ~~oculus~~ meta

EDIT: grammar>>><<<&gt; I don't really see how Pico is less of a walled garden than Meta.

You can install APKs straight from the main menu along with access to Windows Network Shares. Basically, they open the door for you to do your own stuff without their store. 

You can do the same on Quest, but it's all well hidden. They won't even allow you to use your headset without installing some spyware on your phone. And until not too long ago Facebook accounts used to be mandatory. On Pico you can just logout and forget about their online stuff. Remote management of Pico devices also is better than Quest, which matters in business settings.

It's not like Pico is some Beacon of Freedom, but as far as Android stuff goes, it's reasonably open for now. With Meta you always have to worry about how they'll fuck you over the next time, as complete control of the platform is their main motivation for doing VR.>>><<<I cannot use my fucking oculus if i dont have a meta account, how is that not less of a walled garden? They are forcing me to make one or else my device that i paid for will be bricked..................>>><<<You cannot use the Pico 4 without creating a Pico account... Bricked doesn't mean "I didn't log into the headset" it means literally "the headset is unusable".>>><<<I bought the headset there was none of that bullshit, If i buy a BMW now and in 2 years they force me to make a BMW account to use my car will my car be bricked? YES>>><<<No, it's not. Because you can create an account and it functions. That is within the normal functioning of the device.

If something stopped all usage of the device (i.e phones that get bricked cannot start or go into a boot loop) and this is not intended, then it is bricked. Once again, if the device or equipment stops functioning as intended, it is bricked. 

If you have to log into a free account, it is not bricked, you're just refusing to use the device. Which is your prerogative, but saying it's bricked because you don't want to create an account is idiotic.

You need an account for steam, for windows, for your email. Hell, you DO need an account for new car features... Are these services bricked if I don't use them? Lmao... or am I just refusing to use them and agree to their terms of service?>>><<<You have to make an account for practically every headset, I don't see how that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Want to use the Index, need a steam account. Want to use a Pico, have to make a Pico account. Just making an account isn't that big of a deal anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Most things require you to make an account to use them now, including phones. Even Windows heavily pushes you to make one>>><<<It is a good value compared to the Quest Pro, since it also has pancake lenses and higher PPD for significantly less $. Regardless, the Pico 4 like the Quest Pro is not true a PCVR headset.>>><<<Quest and Pico are currently the best ways into wireless PCVR>>><<<I’ve done tons of tests comparing quest (don’t have a pico yet) to a Vive + wigig wireless adapter. 

The Vive beats out the quest ten fold when it comes to latency, compression and gaming performance.

It is a cheap way to use wireless pcvr for sure.. but it is not the best. That’s not saying I recommend most people get a Vive.. there’s a lot of negatives with it.. but the Wigig adapter is significantly better than wifi for short range data transfer>>><<<Seconded. Plus, it's native SteamVR. I get to use any lighthouse-tracked device I want 👌>>><<<Tbh I think its time for Valve to ditch lighthouse-tracking, because tracking without external accessories is already a thing that even PSVR2 has adopted. It saves hardware manufacturing cost, and performance has met the standard for average consumers.>>><<<Inside out tracking doesn't meet that standards need to build future VR games in every situation though. Touch pads are also good enough for "average consumers" but PC gamers use gaming mice. PC games are built on top of a foundation of solid, high performance hardware and PC VR games of the future need the same foundation of high performance hardware. 

Even if you personally chose to use inside out tracking you should be happy that Steam VR lighthouse tracking exists and sets the bar high. You really aren't helping anyone other than companies who want to make low end hardware by arguing against lighthouse tracking. What's wrong with having options?>>><<<yeah I meant the whole package. I am not sure Quest or Pico even excel in a single individual performance subcategory, it's how they bring it all together in a usable way at an attractive price.>>><<<What's your router setup?

Because that is what makes a world's of difference. A proper high bandwidth wifi 6 AX router will work almost identically to a vive+adapter.

A lot of people who have issues with latency and compression on airlink have an outdated router, not having the host PC hardwired into the router, or the router isn't in the same room as the HMD>>><<<It’s.. not.. I have a high end wifi6 router.

I’ve done numerous performance tests with recorded footage… I hate to break it to you.. but quest/pico over WiFi (including the D-link airbridge.. which I tested as well and own) is not anywhere close to the Wigig adapter 

Wigig can seamlessly transfer 7gbs of uplink.. this virtually means 0 latency, 0 compression and performance is the *exact* same as a wired connection (e.g index level of visuals and performance but wireless) 

WiFi had a *max uplink speed* of 100mbs but even that’s not stable and majority is 20-50 even on a high end wifi setup.

What this means is compression.. latency and performance issues. You can see in practical use by playing apps with tons of moving parts or stuff on the screen.

Test it out in a game like tales of glory on steamvr and crank the units on screen to 200-400… your quest will be a blurry mess… a Vive running wireless over Wigig with have a clear picture and be identical to a wired setup.

I mean **no hate towards the quest** for the price it it’s pretty decent… but a Vive+wireless costs 3x more.. and you will get a 10x better pcvr wireless experience.


It’s not just an opinion..it’s in indisputable fact and I can provide the video footage with the performance and latency benchmarks to back this up


There ARE downsides though…which is why this is really only good for people who are into high end VR.. or streamers

You need to be ok with some technical hiccups, the Vive is lower rez (although I used the pro eye with OLED which had better colors imho) and sometimes the Wigig runs into some glitches and it’ll black out and get a grey screen.. adapter also needs to be able to see the receiver.. which means you’re semi limited in a room you can use it in.

And it’s also.. really expensive.. you could probably buy an entire PC+quest just for the price of the headset and adapter 

When it does work.. it is fantastic though>>><<<Virtual desktop streaming is not true PCVR.>>><<<That's some elitist BS.. So when I'm playing Alyx on VD with my quest2 it is not VR. Got it. 🙄>>><<<Laughs in my 4090 VD Pico Setup.

It's the best PCVR Experience I've had thanks to Wireless+ Comfort.>>><<<How hard to run steam pc on the pico? Do I need to buy anything else?>>><<<A good router that supports WiFi 6. And ofc a decent GPU.>>><<<Pretty silly gatekeeping, it's a balance of Pros and Cons honestly. Does a Pico 4 or Quest 2 over VD have the same fidelity as an Index or G2? No of course not, but the tradeoff is you get a full untethered experience and can getup and go playing something with far less preparation and delay. I can go from putting my Quest 2 on to playing something within a minute or so. As long as your wireless router or Hotspot is in the same room the latency should be good enough to never be distracting.>>><<<I'd define PCVR as running PC VR apps and not limit that to a particular way of translating information into an image that doesn't have a future anyways given the popularity of wireless VR>>><<<What other headset do you own other than your Quest.>>><<<None.>>><<<it's not "Native PCVR" but still PCVR nonetheless.>>><<<Just because it doesn't have a displayport connection doesn't mean that it's not a "true PCVR headset"

&amp;#x200B;

Despite them not having displayport they are still better than a lot of "true PCVR" headsets out there for PCVR>>><<<&gt; Despite them not having displayport they are still better than a lot of "true PCVR" headsets out there for PCVR

The O+ with an OLED display is better than the Q2. For some dark games, I literally can't see a thing through the muddy grey mess of the Q2. I can with a O+.

Also, there's latency. Which should be self explanatory. The lag doing wireless PCVR is noticeable.>>><<<It isn’t sold here in Turkey:(>>><<<Owning a Pico 4 for some time now…
It really is a great product. Great price. Best value. Sure it’s bitedance, but u don’t have to have an account to run it. 
I am not into standalone features, for me pcvr is the holy grail and the Pico 4 is on the job like a Maxo 5.>>><<<Easily the best overall PCVR headset today.

A moderator in Skyrim VR sub-Reddit, author of the popular Wabbajack, who had an Index and Pro 2, called it the best image quality for modded Skyrim he ever seen.  And it is wireless.

I hope Quest 3 will at least match it.  Oculus market share dominance still means far better support from developers.>>><<<No, really? A new headset that did not exist before has its Steam number grow quickly? AMAZING! /s


And it "grew" all the way to 0.46%? DOUBLE-AMAZING! /s

Can't wait until they update the data to propely show the Quest Pro... I assume it is part of the 1.38% Other category.>>><<<That is great, the more VR users the better.>>><<<Never heard of it until now but I’m glad more alternatives are becoming available as I’ve already had my quest 2 for a year and I doubt this thing is going to last more than more than 2 years or so before I need something new.>>><<<Would this be a good upgrade from the Vive 1st Gen?>>><<<Absolutely.>>><<<Can it play everything my Vive can? I know the Quest can't handle like half of my games.>>><<<The Quest can handle all your games, you just need to connect it to PCVR, same with the Pico.

&amp;#x200B;

If you use it in stand-alone mode then it can't, because your games are on Steam and standalone can't run steam, but if you connect it to your PC (either through WiFi or USB) then you can play the PC games you own>>><<<Although the title is correct, the market is dominated by Oculus by a wide wide margin.>>><<<2160x2160, pancake lenses, color passthrought, standalone and pcvr (also wireless), cheaper than others, cool controllers.

With a powerbank I can get 12-15h of battery life while playing so more than enough 😁>>><<<This is still just Steam VR, and not standalone.  Curious how they are doing overall.>>><<<Didn't they say a few weeks ago that they are having disappointing sales because they expected to sell 1M units in a stupid timespan?>>><<<They sold less than they expected in China as far as I can remember. 

The customers are probably out protesting instead of buying VR Headsets.>>><<<There's also a ton of choice in China.>>><<<This is what most people in this sub don't get. In China there are a lot more options than in the US.>>><<<If they are referring to western sales then it is no surprise since there was fuck all stock available and very few retailers stocking them. Oh and also a late release date because of that.>>><<<A large portion of the VR community probably lives in the US, and you can't actually buy a Pico officially in North America which probably has a pretty big negative impact on sales>>><<<Maybe this is the first headset ever to properly register on steam apart from their own?  The survey always comes up for me, it's never even once detected my Rift S or HP Reverb.>>><<<It's because the hardware survey that runs for normal hardware collection isn't what is used to gather data on VR headsets. Due to it being very unreliable, they use a metric added in SteamVR that shows the headsets used in the last 30 days. If you use an Index and a Vive Pro, both will show up in the survey. If you don't use any headset for 30 days, it will drop off of the survey. Even if you leave it plugged in. 

They've been doing it that way for a few years now. 

https://www.roadtovr.com/valve-tweaks-steam-survey-accurately-count-vr-headsets-pimax/>>><<<That’s very interesting tbh>>><<<I've always wondered how it works with wireless headsets like the Quest and Pico, since those aren't always connected and afaik it just picks a single "random" time to do the sample>>><<<Can't be surprised - i sold my Quest 2 a day after i bought the Pico 4 - great headset.>>><<<Does the Pico 4 fix the weight/comfort issues with the Quest 2?  That's the biggest issue for me so bad that it affects immersion (yes I bought an aftermarket strap for my Quest 2.  I have like 4 of them).>>><<<The comfort of P4 is a lot better even when my Q2 had the elite strap.>>><<<Too bad it kind of sucks and we’re just so eager to replace Meta we’d rather go with the CCP. Crazy to me. Meta sucks, I know, but it’s a great product and I’d rather have it than Pico. There’s swim issues, the CPU/GPU are constantly running at max level, their streaming performance is atrocious compared to airlink, etc.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<People just really hate Facebook/Meta for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree that collecting data is a bad thing overall, and it can be a reason to buy one headset over the other.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you are someone who uses Amazon, Google , or other social medias on a regular basis then it's cherry-picking to complain about Meta's data considering that same data is already being collected and sold.>>><<<Quite literally any website that warns you about the type of cookies they collect is collecting more data than they need. And that's why the Meta hate is overblown. If you hate Meta for that reason you hate most other tech companies out there.

Btw most of is collected for Big data analysis rather than having specific info on a person.>>><<<&gt; Meta's data considering that same data is already being collected and sold.

It's not the same. When has Amazon gathered people's tax return financial data? Meta has.

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/popular-tax-prep-software-sent-financial-information-to-meta-report.html>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<You’d rather the Chinese government have that information to further target and sow dissent in groups?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<... Meta has, yes, had some pretty serious scandals in the past but by and large seem to be taking privacy and security pretty seriously on the VR side of things (I mean, they even removed a depth sensor over concerns in the Pro). Can you name a privacy violation or security leak that's occurred from Meta's VR products? Any evidence they're selling or handing over data? Because you can be damn sure Pico/ByteDance, as a CCP owned company, is doing exactly that.>>><<<I don't live in China. What can they do to me? Nothing. I live in the US. What can the US government do to me? Everything.

Also, Pico doesn't know who you are. They don't even ask for your name. It's hard to target anonymous people. That's why VPNs work.>>><<<Most western companies do not kill people that disagree with them and make whole families disapear.>>><<<lol, are you sure about that? Besides, China has a lot of stuff that can be fairly criticized but there’s also a lot of anti-China propaganda being spewed around in our beloved western countries. And assassinating political dissidents is one of those>>><<<I know what's bad and that's both of them. I don't want either on my system unless they can run independently as hardware.

QQ though, with sidequest, does that mean that you no longer need anything meta? Drivers, Oculus login etc to use the hardware to play games or pcvr?>>><<<People aren’t stupid. They’re just easily swayed into stupid combative groups, just like politics.>>><<<People buy Chinese handheld devices all the time.  Now it's "jumping in bed with the CCP?"

Or is that just the official Meta company line you're quoting?>>><<<Or maybe that we are pointing out the ignorant hypocrisy.>>><<<There's no hypocrisy.  People like Tik Tok and they don't like Facebook it's really that simple.>>><<<Yeah, I am just going to pick up a Quest 3 whenever it comes out. Interested in what Valve comes up with, but if it is priced like the Index, not sure I'll be able to financially justify it.>>><<<Yah, spending $1k on a VR headset is just a lot for most people, especially considering when a headset half the price is nearly as good. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people don't seem to understand value, whenever someone asks if they should get a Quest 2 there's always someone jumping in telling them to buy a Vive Pro or wait for the Pimax Crystal instead>>><<<You’re being downvoted and you shouldn’t be.>>><<<Tbh With lack of US availability, I’m betting resell value will remain relatively stable (where I am) til we know a release for the Quest 3. I’ll flip it to an enthusiast and swap out.>>><<<Your info is out-of-date, there's been updates to optimise CPU/GPU power usage.  See the release notes from Pico 4's updates.


It's worth noting that going for the third party streaming Virtual Desktop on Pico 4 version offers better streaming quality than on Quest 2.>>><<<Still doesn’t deal with swim and image wobble issues.>>><<<I’ve had zero swim or wobble, perhaps check if your router is truly optimal for the purpose with zero other devices on the 5G frequency band. Same issue with Quest Link>>><<<I don’t mean streaming. Just the image in general in standalone. It has weird issues.>>><<<Sounds like your headset has defects, which is the main reason I believe people shouldn't buy it if they live in the US (since it makes it a pain to return and there quality control kind of sucks)>>><<<I agree. But to be fair this issue was mentioned in the UploadVR articles too.>>><<<Pico has pretty bad quality control and a lot of people ended up getting lenses with defects>>><<<PCVR using Virtual Desktop is amazing! No vendor lock-in and stream whatever your desktop/laptop can render!>>><<<Yea, no vendor lock in, except, you know for Valve.>>><<<What system has a vendor lock-in?>>><<<Playstation VR>>><<<We are talking about PCVR systems here. Not console VR. Since you bring up PlayStation VR you should know that PC drivers exist for it to be used in Steam VR as well.>>><<<To be fair, every App Store tries to lock/contain you within their ecosystem, **including Steam**. But I prefer Steam Store VS Pico or Oculus stores.>>><<<You can use Steam on any of the currently available headsets including those from Pico and Meta.>>><<<I love mine. Well deserved in my book>>><<<Good to see>>><<<Having used the pico 3 eye an really disappointing by pico seems like a really prototype product>>><<<The software is a bit prototype feeling (issues). And the face cover was not designed for western face shapes it seems.

Those are the two obvious issues IMO.Oh and no DP over USB-C but I hear that was done deliberately to make PCVR less interesting for customers since they don't make money selling Steam games.....

(I wish we'd get a VR HMD co that doesn't think in such anti-consumer ways!)>>><<<&gt;make PCVR less interesting for customers since they don't make money selling Steam games.....

They failed atleast partially, would probably be more popular if it did have DP over USB-C.>>><<<I don't think they care about how popular their headset is if they can't make more money off of it and I'm confident most of the people who bought the pico 4 aren't interested in standalone games>>><<<&gt;I'm confident most of the people who bought the pico 4 aren't interested in standalone games

I can only speak for myself but I would be interested in them if they all had a unified store so I dont have to lock myself in a one echo system. I would assume Sidequest allows for this but there aren't much games for Pico there yet.>>><<<If they supported DP, they would probably need to sell the headset at a higher price. From what I've read, they're losing 140$ per headset, in the hope of making that money back from games sales. However, I'm sure there's a good number of people who would be willing to shell out a little bit more for a "Pico 4 Link" with DisplayPort.>>><<<(look up the Pimax Crystal, it will offer wireless VR but also has displayport connection)>>><<<And that´s a good thing.

Oculus with it´s walled garden is waaay to dangerous.>>><<<This is SteamVR, what walls are you talking about?>>><<<Indeed with Virtual Desktop and the Pico Assistant we can jump it´s limitations>>><<<And you can't do that with a Quest...?>>><<<&gt;\[...\] and the Pico Assistant \[...\]

Good luck with that lol>>><<<And Bytedance isn't? O.o?>>><<<Seriously so many ignorant posts here. Pico ecosystem is barely different from Quest, yet you get people acting like the product coming from Bytedance is the most open one lol>>><<<Compared to Oculus ? No !>>><<<How? What does a walled garden mean anymore? It’s not just a word you use to describe a company you’re conditioned to hate…>>><<<Bytedance owns Tik Tok and has been known to share data with the Chinese government.

How is that any better than meta?>>><<<Yeah, the CCP is way better>>><<<This link has been shared 1 time.

It was almost like they were helping me craft an argument for my spouse that this wasn't in fact a ridiculous purchase>>><<<I also use my TV to play PS5 and Switch, that's not even possible with the headset.>>><<<Sell the family and then you don’t need a tv?>>><<<Yea I’m definitely not going to be able to get it lol. $3k was the limit for me sadly.>>><<<Even if you COULD afford it  - why? What can this thing do that is worth 3k?>>><<<At this point it is a developer device. They need to build up their ecosystem first to compete with meta.

Wait for a year or two and they should have a cheaper mass consumer version out.>>><<<I agree, I think they want to iron out the gesture controls, and see how early adopters feel in general and what needs tuning.>>><<<It’s like the first iPad. Devs and apple enthusiasts get to run the public beta. Two years after, they launch Vision Pro 2 and Vision SE, hopefully having a handful of actual game titles to sell.>>><<<As a developer, let me explain why this isn't that bad of a deal, but yes it's not a product for VR gamers.  

1. They mentioned using Xcode and 3D creation/drafting/rendering. But they didn't mention it needing to be tethered to a MacBook. 
2. It has 3D cameras and LiDAR. Basically it has not just a high quality camera built in, but one that can scan 3D objects.  

Xcode is the IDE for developing iOS and Mac apps. As of now, it can **NOT** be used on an iPad (not even the Pro). It's a very heavy application. It also has the ability to run an iOS simulator for testing applications.  

This headset has the computational and rendering power of an entire M2 MacBook built into it.  

The M2 MacBook is already a $1500 device. And that device doesn't come with 3D scanning cameras. So the AR headset aspect of this is really about $2000.>>><<<Xcode could easily run on the IPad Pro, this is just a design decision by apple.>>><<<&gt; It has 3D cameras and LiDAR. Basically it has not just a high quality camera built in, but one that can scan 3D objects.

Will that scanning work better than what LiDAR does on iPad Pro? Because frankly the one on iPad does a terrible job, and people get better results with just series of photos alone, that I get with LiDAR.>>><<<It's a spatial computer as they say. it's not a side thing. it's the main thing. and it can also serve as a pseudo pro screen for your devices.>>><<<Starts at $3499. STARTS AT!>>><<<Want another 8gb of ram and another 256gb of storage? That price will be closer to 5k.>>><<<Turns out 4K per eye was the PRICE>>><<<This is too good. Lol.>>><<<They clearly believe in it but 3499$ is a LOT.>>><<<Yeah, given how well 1.5k QuestPro did, it is a tough price tag to swallow. Granted, apple has a different level of consumers, but still, they paint it as an everyday device for students and normal folks, so they must count on at least _some_ units being moved.>>><<<If they sell this, they will sell it to rich people who were not interested in VR until this moment. It will be for the wow factor at the beginning (and it has a really strong wow factor). At least for this first wave of these devices I don't think it will be bought with the utility in mind because let's be honest it doesn't do anything that you cannot do in a less cool, much more affordable, way at the moment.   


However, if they can get it in enough influencers hands and establish a feeling of exclusivity for the experiences that you can only have with it (e.g. 3D facetime or what do they call it) and lower the price for the second wave maybe they can break into the larger market. We will see I suppose. Personally I don't have that kind of money laying around but I want it to succeed because I want more—less expensive—devices like this that cater also to my gamer's needs.>>><<<&gt; and lower the price for the second wave

that's what I was thinking, given that they opened with Pro version, probbly because like you said they wanted to max out on wowness of it, there maybe will be a regular version later, not as fancy but also not as pricey.>>><<<There have been rumors for the last few years that they will come out with a lower cost, more casual set of AR glasses more akin to Google glass. They could easily be setting up for an “Apple Vision Pro”, “Apple Vision” and “Apple &lt;Glass?&gt;” lineup for their new spatial computing platform.

I think you’re right that they are starting here for wow factor so that they have people’s attention as the lineup moves down market.>>><<<Spatial computing is such an apple term>>><<<Agreed. This isn't a consumer product. This is like when Honda builds a racecar so they can attract innovative engineers and use lessons learned in the year's Civic.>>><<<&gt; If they sell this, they will sell it to rich people who were not interested in VR until this moment. It will be for the wow factor at the beginning (and it has a really strong wow factor).

Which is essentially what Apple did with the original Mac.

It too was expensive - $2500, but that was in 1984 dollars, which is about $7000 in 2022 dollars.>>><<<They really said “we ain’t losing a dime on this” when I was thinking they would sell it at least $2.5k>>><<<OMG. That external screen is "3D" like how autostereoscopic devices work. With a lenticular lens. Someone looking at you sees the correct perspective depending on what angle they are looking at you from.>>><<<I feel like a lot of the engineering must have gone into this thing alone. And I am not so sure people will actually use it.>>><<<This feels like the first feature to get dropped once generation 2 comes out. It looks impressive, but it'll be dead weight 99% of the time. I don't expect people to walk around with this thing in public.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<It’s also SUPER distinctive, like the iPhone “notch” (now dynamic island), the shape of AirPods in your ear, and the shape of an Apple Watch

It gives it its distinctive look and I’d be utterly shocked if it doesn’t stay around for a very long time>>><<<Have been using and owning VR headsets since the Oculus DK1 and I reckon this makes a lot of sense. You might as well be on another planet with most headsets and it's just not practical for a lot of people a lot of the time. Nerds (like me) might be happy with pass through but hey.. using your own eyes is much much better.

EDIT: I'm an idiot people, it doesn't work like that!>>><<<It's not your own eyes, it's passthrough cameras, and it projects a 3D image of your face on the other side>>><<<It won’t get dropped from the flagship, but it will for vision SE, which will be $1500 and seem like a deal.>>><<<I don't think it will even get dropped from the SE. This is the secret sauce at this point. I fully agree with charlie\_nosuf above. this is the only way people will stop looking at VR as an anti-social experience. This is truly great for the future of VR/MR/XR.>>><<<It's essential to making it an augmented reality device, in the sense that people may actually want to be around you while you're wearing it.>>><<<&gt;people may actually want to be around you 

Let's not ask the impossible here....>>><<<For just 3500$, people might actually want to be around you!>>><<<if i had $3500 to blow itd be on making people want to be around me in other ways, like therapy or cocaine.>>><<<I'm kinda curious how this will actually look. Lenticular lenses are cool because they allow passive, glasses-less 3D, but there's a massive tradeoff with resolution since you need to provide a separate set of pixels for each perspective. If they took an normal iPhone display and used a lens with 10 different perspectives the effective resolution would only be somewhere around 360p.

I also found it a bit weird how dim it looked in all their shots. Probably just to preserve battery life, but still wouldn't have expected that in marketing material>>><<<Low resolution might be exactly why the lenticular display looks dim.  My other thought was maybe the effect was a little creepy and looked "off" enough that making it dimmer hid some of the uncanny valley-ness to it.>>><<<Yep, definitely this. Plus makes it more like sunglasses, which people used to. Too clear would be pretty obvious display, but this gives subtle ques to outside viewer where your looking. Plus low resolution not issue, because your going to be looking at it from a distance.>>><<<Yeah this was rumored to be how it would work, and I actually love it a lot. My hot take is that this feature is worth the “wasted” power/weight in order to make this headset the kind of product Apple wants to position it as.>>><<<Given how antisocial VR feels and how careful Apple is with design, I wouldn’t be surprised if it actually really helps>>><<<Right, for vr I am not positive of how useful it will be but for AR, this will make it way less weird because you will actually be able to know if someone can see you or not

I thought it was pretty clever>>><<<That and that it can “mix in” a person that comes into the room.  
Verge writer “gasped” when he started to talk to someone while wearing it and they appeared in the space he was watching a movie in.>>><<<Agreed, I've seen a lot of criticism of it, but I thought it was awesome.  A very Apple touch to put so much work into something that is kind of useless, but they know will make the product a lot more palatable.  It will make me feel a lot more comfortable wearing it with people around if they can see my eyes.>>><<<It’s a ready player one inspired headset>>><<<"My bad girl I wasn't actually looking at your tits, I was just simply looking for a way to get rid of this candy crush notification">>><<<*touches tits* sorry ma’am I thought you were virtual>>><<<Awkwardly, itll show your eyes when people are present, so if she sees your eyes she is gonna know>>><<<Just wear sunglasses under the headset 🗿>>><<<From the comments here I dont know why people expected Apple to make a VR gaming headset. Apple Product are Lifestyle and Productivity. 

And this thing, a least Tech wise, looks like the next generation for that categories.

The price tho is pretty immense. 3499$ is alot, costs way more that MacBooks. Does the Vision Pro have justifications over just buying a MacBook and work with a external second Monitor? Guess its up for the developers If this thing finds its way to main stream.>>><<<From the demo, it appears that it will work as a 2nd monitor for your Mac. Or at least a projection of your Mac's screen.

From my POV this isn't a huge selling point given the battery limitations and the true resolution would fall beneath what you get IRL from a ~5k display.>>><<<I've been using the Varjo Aero to watch movies and surf YouTube/websites for awhile now, and after experiencing a 200 ft virtual screen for my desktop, I willingly trade the bulky HMD over traditional 5K monitors. Not to mention, Apple is claiming they're able to project virtual desktops all around you. That is the one feature I'm most excited about. And if they're able to integrate hand tracking gestures seamlessly with voice commands, I'm more than ready to reenact Minority Report from the comfort of my couch; wearing nothing but my birthday suit.>>><<<23 mio pixels is a square resolution of 3400x3400 per eye which is much higher than the very next best headset at 2880x2880. That custom lenses also look HQ. I am sure this will be finally enough to read text sharp and clearly. Sure its not like a retina LCD but close>>><<<Micro oled. Edge to edge clarity lenses.>>><<<Wonder what the FOV is though.>>><<<[removed]>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I'm just happy they actually used real terminology for the displays instead of calling them something stupid like "micro retina displays".>>><<<I was waiting for the slideshow to reveal the "More Field of View than other things">>><<<[deleted]>>><<<There is nothing for Apple to compare their device to anyway as if you saw the reveal, they invented everything!>>><<<Bro, they had to explain what AR is in the video so normies understand what the device even does. They're not going to talk about FOV.>>><<<[removed]>>><<<Apple has dropped plenty of techie specs in the past. Remember the introduction of "Retina"?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Live update on specs here: https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/141nloe/apples\_vrar\_headset\_vision\_pro\_specs/>>><<<STARTING at $3499. Yikes.

Really great demo, though. I want one.>>><<<Sigh... *sells car**>>><<<Funny name for a kidney :D>>><<<Good that they mentioned that Apple Stores will allow Demos. I wont ever buy one, but I certainly want to try one>>><<<same>>><<<Well, other companies are bound to make their own versions soon enough, so I can't wait to get something like it in the next 5-10 years.>>><<<It has a MacBook built into it, basically. The cheapest Xcode capable device you can buy is $1000-$1400 but since it's an M2, you'd have to start from M2 capable MacBooks. Add in the AR capabilities, 3d camera capabilities... The price isn't bad, but you get a lot of stuff you might not need if all you wanted was VR experiences.>>><<<I'm surprised no one has mentioned the tether. It looks like it goes into a puck in a pocket.>>><<<It's an external battery pack that goes in your pocket, lasts up to 2 hours.>>><<<Ah nice. Now Apple can burn a hole in my pocket... twice.>>><<<They gave it an external battery that can't even power it long enough to watch a movie on the apps they presented? For this price? Yikes.>>><<<I mean, you could buy a swap batter for the low low price of $999, or $1999 should you want that battery on fancy wheels ;D xD>>><<<Good point, I remember reading something confirming that their battery has a proprietary connector.>>><<<You can also plug it in when you're not walking around.>>><<<like the wall?>>><<<It's clearly a compromise they needed to do but are **not** happy about.

Also notice how Tim Cook announced it as AR headset. He's not a fan of VR, he doesn't even want to mention it. Not even "Mixed Reality".>>><<<Yeah the entire thing has been very AR focused. The only mention of VR is environments and even then they didn't want to really emphasize it can be all encompassing.>>><<<And yet they continuously do, with "environments." It's all pretty clearly trying to get people not to ask about Quest store or Steam VR. They've also never used the word "game".>>><<<They did at the end.

You can play games on your augmented flat screen with your ps5 controller.>>><<<They also name-dropped "unity games and software". They're avoiding talking about any competition in the VR space very intentionally. They want their developers to make games, but they don't want laypeople to start looking at what they can get with a Quest or PCVR for far less money if they don't already know.>>><<<They absolutely [did same game](https://youtu.be/GYkq9Rgoj8E?t=6082). But they never said Virtual Reality or 3D games. It was play existing "Apple Arcade Games" and they even showed the person using a game controller. I THINK it was a PS5 controller but I'm not 100% sure. 

Later in the presentation they did specifically [announce Unity support/partnership](https://youtu.be/GYkq9Rgoj8E?t=7259) for games. But they never said VR gaming...>>><<<I mean even just attempting to reinvent AR as "spacial computing" is absolutely ridiculous. But it's apple, so.>>><<<Maybe that explains why they didn’t demonstrate anything that was really VR - they showed gaming on a giant virtual screen but no VR games at all. Which for an incredible looking bit of hardware was really odd.>>><<<Pinch to zoom, but without a controller! So cool! This headset seems SO GOOD at making you feel like you're not wearing a headset, but doesn't seem to do much to make you feel like you're in virtual reality and that saddens me greatly.>>><<<Video for anyone that missed the keynote https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg>>><<<That pixel count reveal was very interesting… if it truly looks crystal clear in the headset, then this will be the future. That said, at that price, I suspect it will be V2 or V3 before true mainstream support>>><<<I suspect apple knows this as well.>>><<<They named it Pro for that reason IMO>>><<<Very impressive tech but I wonder who the customer segment actually is... I have some thoughts that I haven't seen others talk about.

GOOD

* A technical marvel that from a 'technical' perspective will blow its mainstream competition away - more powerful than any other standalone headset, very high resolution and display quality, excellent build quality, excellent hand &amp; eye tracking, knowing Apple the audio will be good, iris-scanning, etc.
* User interface looks very polished.
* Access to Apple's iOS and Mac ecosystem from day one is a huge advantage over the Quest Pro (add onto that Apple's experience in the prosumer space).
* External battery pack, I expect many will disagree with me here but I think having the battery be external allows you to not front-load the devices weighting, switch out batteries when one dies, and connect to power directly without still carrying that battery weight.
* Works with BT keyboard and mice - absolute win for productivity. Will depend on how good the passthrough quality is but given how much of a focus Apple has had on this being for MR it should be great... right.
* The focus on 2D &amp; traditional applications gives me hope that they will be the first one to get the 'productivity' side of VR/MR right.

MIXED

* Hand tracking - Don't get me wrong if any company can nail the hand tracking UX it is Apple, but that fact that this isn't out till next year and we didn't get any live demo of the hand tracking is concerning.
* The Strap - A simple front-loaded mount with a strap that compresses it to your face... given this is a 'productivity' device surely a more ergonomic halo strap would have been better for long-session comfortability. I hope this isn't a case of Apple choosing form over function. Moving the battery external should help but its competitors use plastic not glass and metal so... we will  see.
* Battery Life - Seems short, but given external battery probably not that big of a deal.
* Voice Control - Reliance on voice control (especially for typing text) has me worried how this device will perform for non-english speakers or those with a thick accent but keyboard connectivity and hand-tracking exist so probably fine either way.
* The Price - The price is absurd. I can see an argument for "its replacing your computer, tablet, TV, monitor, etc. all in one device so it is actually cheaper" or "its a dev-kit for developers and early adopters, a cheaper device is coming in a year or two". Though it is Apple and they are marketing masters so they can probably still ship it.

CONCERNS

* No **optional** controllers? Seems like a lost opportunity, in the VR/MR industry - gaming is the biggest sector by far right now. Now hardcore gaming is not Apple's expertise but still most of the successful VR games right now are arcade-y style games that would gel with Apple's vibe very well. Had a quick peek at the limited information on the SDK and the unity support and it looks to me that the tools to build great games will exist. If optional controllers existed then you could also let Valve/PCVR developers do the heavy lifting porting more hardcore VR games to MacOS.
* No mention of Fitness applications? Probably the second biggest VR software market right now... and one that is right up Apple's alley (Apple Watch, mindfulness VR app, etc). I was a bit surprised - I really expected Apple to double down after the mindfulness reveal, sell the Apple Vision Pro as a lifestyle.  Some of the current VR workout apps are great so it is kind of a weird exclusion although I expect third-party developers will cook something up. Got me a worried that the strap isn't that tight and won't stay on during activity.

SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

* I would not be surprised if Apple has a limit on how close to your eyes objects are allowed to get. Vergence-accommodation conflict is very immersion breaking and I could see Apple hyper focusing the UX. Could explain their focus on 2D applications.
* I wonder if each of the mainstream players will stake out a different section of the VR market. Sony in the medium-high end gaming market, Quest at the low-end mass-market approach, Apple in the high-end productivity space, etc. All with a different approach till either VR/MR dies out or it becomes more mainstream.>>><<<If this can replace my laptop, two additional monitors, mic, speakers, webcam, quest 2, mouse, and keyboard, while also giving me more displays, AR integration, and let me continue to work from home, it could be worth that price tag. But it would require all my current tech to no longer work just justify the replacement, AND it would have to be as powerful as my laptop.

I will watch Vision Pro’s career with great interest.>>><<<That scene of the dude watching his kids play with the headset on was so dystopian looking. Straight out of black mirror. Like play with your kid! Take off the headset!>>><<<Literally exactly the same as that scene in Minority Report where Tom Cruise watches a 3D video of his dead son. Life imitates Art>>><<<I mean that is the point, no? He can still see and interact with people with the headset on?

No different than him watching them with the TV on, or with a phone in hand, or both.>>><<<I think it would be great to relive memories from many years ago>>><<<Only €3499,99>>><<<Yep, the device is amazing, but the price is meh. Although they say the quality and experience blows out of the water any high end tv and sound system. Let's see.>>><<<No way the tiny speakers even come close to a proper AV system, especially in the low-end of the frequency range.>>><<<Yes if you live alone. What about your SO or family members?>>><<<They can look at your awesome representation of a face on the headset.

-dad, where is all of our money, and what is on your head? 

-_dials the crown all the way for immersion_ I can't see you honey, not right now. 

;D 


Speaking of family, lol, that scene where they presented taking 3D video and pictures was funny as hell, they didn't show it, but there was a dad in a f**ing gogles at his doughters birthday, imagine his wife being like:

-not this shit again steven, you were supposed to return them 


xD xD xD>>><<<So if this is Spatial computing, why is everything on 2D surfaces? Feel they could have built a lot more genuine volumetric  3D apps with avatars etc.>>><<<Finally someone's noticing. All these headsets still have 2D interfaces. X and Y. Maybe it'll take a while to evolve design with depth in mind.>>><<<Because that would require developing new apps.  And considering the size of the usebase at that pricepoint, nobody is going to be developing new apps specifically for this device.

It has the same issues as current VR gamedev (low install base = low profits = lack of development) but even worse.  I think Apple have realised that and wisely (and very honestly) focussed on projecting existing apps on 2D surfaces.>>><<<I'm honestly really surprised by the negative reaction on this subreddit. The attention to detail and hardware innovations that were shown in the presentation are astonishing. 

We should be trying to support the adoption of VR here. Even if it doesn't deliver on the hype, this headset has achieved huge milestones that I've been waiting to hear about for years. 

Regardless of cost, at least Apple used all of its resources at its disposal to make the strongest push in the history of this industry to make a headset. That alone is commendable.>>><<<The price is my only negative reaction.  The lack of good VR gaming was expected. The displays, sensors, audio, and overall hardware design are very impressive to me.>>><<<Agreed>>><<<I'm a pretty Apple'y person and am turned off by the Vision Pro after mulling it over for a bit. It's clear they are positioning it as a springboard for VisionOS and a world where the tight control they exert over the App Store remains intact.

That's fine for a mobile device. But for a $3500 'pro' device is unacceptable, and really eliminates all the attractive edge cases that make expensive VR setups worth the effort.

My gut tells me Apple won't win this generation of devices, in the near term anyways — because they can't see beyond their own business case to create something that advocates for the platform itself.

Or put it another way… iOS and the App Store unlocked the potential of Smartphones and made things easier for most consumers. The same doesn't appear to be true of VisionOS.

Apple is essentially entering the VR headset market, where it will eventually be outpriced by hungrier competitors who are not shackled by the need to service a App Store model.>>><<<I'm not an apple user so I'm curious for your opinion:

Do you think apple may be seeing this as complementary/a straight up portable replacement to the Mac ecosystem?

I'm not sure how much of a tight control apple has over the mac ecosystem (especially vs iOS) but with recent trends being to merge the two (correct me if I'm wrong) it seems like VisionOS may eventually go the same way.

If they can snag developers into the VisionOS ecosystem and get industry-favoured apps for specific workflows, a final cut-esque thing, then I can see apple gaining a lot of ground in the XR space just by being the thing companies need to buy into again.>>><<<This is a gigantic 'what if' scenario, because strapping goggles to your head for extended periods of time remains a huge physical barrier that goes way beyond wearing something on your wrist.

I think Apple sees this as another way to interact with what is becoming a platform agnostic blob of applications that are able to function across different surfaces.

This surface happens to be the experimental, bleeding edge, with the potential to be a dud or take over the world.

I could see an outcome where Apple does this right and we're all editing videos in a minority-report like environment. But for this type of workflow to be truly productive it requires Apple to allow VisionOS software to do things that it's not wholly comfortable with iOS accomplishing.

The jury is way way out. I think Apple would love it if we ignored most of the complex, heady stuff completely and were content with simply consuming media, simple VisionOS-exclusive apps and simple things like iMessage, Hangouts, etc.>>><<<I think Apple definitely sees this as the future of consumer desktop computing

The Mac laptops will basically just be terminals for the AR ecosystem, and I personally think this is the killer use case

When Microsoft announced HoloLens, despite all its flaws, I thought this was the direction they were going. 

Apple showed basically what I’ve always envisioned for VR 

Early reviews by people demoing them, including apple skeptics like MKBHD, are pretty stellar

Imagine two moores law cycles when the devices are 1/4 as small or 1/4 the price and Apple has a winner IMO>>><<<As a small time filmmaker I’m interested in the camera technology involved. Apple makes great cameras as seen in how easy it is to have great photo and video with the thing in your pocket. I like the idea of a first person perspective to be used for documentaries or for specialized shots in short films.>>><<<This is a gaming sub that doesn’t want to spend 3500 on a device that doesn’t really game.>>><<<This isn’t r/VRGaming though, it’s a sub for all things virtual reality.>>><<<It does a better job presenting itself as a multi-faceted device for professionals than the Quest Pro did. The differences between the presentation and marketing of those devices are just so stark. Quest Pro had a lot of "potential" labeled with it. Apple is taking a grounded approach and telling you straight up that hey. All these feature sets are available day one. At the $3499 price point, I imagine that for professionals this is the audience they'll be appealing to with this. 

For your average consumer, this is way outside their price range. Mind you, what they showed off was neat but $3499 neat? Nah. I'll wait for that Vision SE. 

I won't get one because I don't think I'm part of the audience they're targeting and $3499 is too much. Just happy to see another big company enter the mixed reality space.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<How people can't see this astounds me>>><<<Vision Pro, Vision SE, Vision...

Yeah the naming system is pretty good>>><<<It has LiDAR for hand tracking, not camera based.  

The cable is to a battery pack, not tethered to a phone or computer.  

I feel like a lot of you need to wait until the keynote is over before throwing out criticism because most of the negative things you're pointing out get addressed literally 5 minutes after you write those comments.>>><<<&gt; It has LiDAR for hand tracking, not camera based.

rip elon fanboys>>><<<Tesla's own engineers told him not to completely remove radar. They said we weren't there yet for camera technology.>>><<<There are a lot of kids and gamers here who are just looking for any opportunity to shit on it.>>><<<From a technical standpoint, this looks amazing if it works the way it says it does. My criticism is more on its use case and intended audience. I'm pretty sure that even the most hardcore of Apple fans are not used to dishing out $3500 for even a personal device. They played hard toward the non-business crowd, so it has me confused as I could never seen any regular person buying this for such a price. Like, it looks really great from a technical standpoint and maybe even worth that money, but it's like the Varjo aero. So good, but totally out of the hands of any average person, even enthusiasts maybe. For such a price, I think VR enthusiasts would at least like to, you know, play VR games or use Steam, and for anyone not convinced that AR should even be a thing, this is going to look cool but totally unattainable. I only hope it just gives people at least a somewhat better idea of what AR is actually capable of as it's a real device now.  


Not to mention, also stuck to Apple's ecosystem.>>><<<&gt; I'm pretty sure that even the most hardcore of Apple fans are not used to dishing out $3500 for even a personal device.

There's a reason all the people they showed demoing the device lived in mansions and wore designer clothes lol.  

I think they made the right choice, go all out on tech regardless of cost.  It's not going to sell a lot but it's a start.  They positioned it as a replacement for a computer/screen/speakers, which is smart.  Like, a MacBook could easily set you back $2-3k.  Now, will people be replacing their laptops with this gen 1?  Probably not, but a few years from now who knows.>>><<<I agree, it seems super odd they put so much tech into this for what they are advertising as a desktop/movie viewer.

That is not a use case that people enjoy using AR/VR for.>>><<<I mean, it is *a* use case and is definitely nice to have. Sitting around with some friends I made in Big screen to watch a movie and throw popcorn around is good times too. It's just not what I would expect to be the main use case for a headset that is *2 to 3* times more expensive than even the Quest Pro, a headset many people did not buy, and that had similar features like color passthrough, eye and face tracking, good lenses, but with standalone VR and PCVR content. It's not a bad headset by any means from what I see. In fact, it's a technical marvel possibly with its own built from the ground up OS. I just have to ask who in the world is going to buy such an expensive device to bring on aboard a plane to watch movies?>>><<<That is definitely the main stickler.

It will do what it does very well, better than any of the competition, but a Quest Pro does it almost as well for less than a 1/3rd of the cost while being capable of far more. Honestly even that seems optimistic because a 2-hour battery life isn't even enough for most movies.

The vision Pro is an incredibly niche device, that is trying to create a market that doesn't yet exist, at a price point far too high for even VR enthusiasts. It shows the potential for the next decade far more than it offers anything today.>>><<<&gt; That is not a use case that people enjoy using AR/VR for.

Well, not yet. Because we didn't have any device that even function for that use case. Apple seems pretty confident that this thing can be used for movies and reading text without feeling like a downgrade over a regular monitor or TV.>>><<<It is what it is. It’s expensive but they did not hold back on technology or innovation. I’d rather it be that way. As years progress it’ll get cheaper. 

If you want cheap, there’s Quest>>><<<That was my thought. If they are gonna price this at Mac level prices, they better throw everything they got at it in terms of technology.>>><<<It's pretty... ideal positioning. It's essentially doing the things it needs to be usable as a primary compute device that let's you do the things that you'd normally do on your normal computing devices... but spatially.

that's very different from a vr headset that can show you a preview of the experience of spatial computing... but for the low resolution, spotty accuracy, questionable controls, lack of comfort, and jank ar.

People are complaining about the price because they've been anchored by subsidized vr consoles.

they'll get annoyed when they realize apple has just skipped making toys and dove straight into the eventual end game of computing interfaces... and thus the price relates to high end computing devices like Mac books pros, and not gaming first devices like consoles.>>><<<Yeah this is the thing I don’t think people are appreciating. This is by far the most “complete” device we’re getting in the VR/AR space. 

It’s not supposed to complement anything, it’s supposed to be its own all-encompassing device.>>><<<For now you'll still need a Mac though unless you want to limit yourself to iPad apps.>>><<<While no technical specs were mentioned, they did say 12 ms per frame, which translates to 90 Hz. Also the displays will have „more pixels than a 4K TV“ per eye.>>><<<The 12ms was referring to the passthrough latency though>>><<<Oh was it? I didn’t catch that, thanks!>>><<<Longtime (since 2015) VR user here. This is absolutely phenomenal and needs more praise instead of putting Apple down and chewing on the pricesticker.

This is not a Quest competitor! You can have your VR-gamingconsole made by several parties. This is a first of its kind spatial computing device with focus on working first, me time and entertainment second,>>><<<Understandably, it’s just the beginning. What’s important is that Apple took the plunge. They introduced a completely new experience. The tech will only evolve. Bye bye screens.>>><<<A completely new experience for what?>>><<<For working harder and watching TV. Except it's not new. At all.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Exactly! But some people are just too shortsighted to see what this means. As for the price tag, the first iPhone also cost way more than how much people were used to paying for a phone back then.>>><<<Look back to the iPod. The iPhone was conceptualized as an iPod that could make phone calls.  Before iPod there was just cassette tape Walkman and CD-RW disc players.  Maybe a few primitive mp3 players around the same time but nothing with a customer facing design or OS built in.>>><<<It looks cool. I would pay $1000 for it.>>><<<Looks lovely, but my immediate thought is that that big concave single piece of glass on the front is going to get scratched to hell the first time you put it face-down on the counter by accident. Don’t think that’s going to be cheap to replace, some clip-on plastic cover is going to be an essential 3rd party purchase and that will kinda hurt the fancy look it has going.>>><<<Very first thoughts / reactions -

- it's gigantic. I thought it would be much more sleek and more natural looking. I'm cautious because I also thought apple watch and AirPods looked ridiculous initially but the general public got over it. But this might as well be a Quest Pro on your face. Even worse with the puck dangling off it.
- quite surprised how little emphasis on AR. Very little overlays on real world, no real mention of shared space interactions. 
- really long time focusing on pretty well established / almost boring uses of VR/AR. Watching movies, viewing photos, etc
- codec avatars! really cool and probably super annoying for Meta to see Apple introducing this to the world
- literally saying they "invented" so many things that had nothing to do with them (micro OLED screens invented by Apple, really?)
- way more consumer emphasis than I expected. Priced as it is, I feel like it really needs a strong professional use case to sell. But literally no discussion of professional apps. Where are the architecture, engineering, biology etc apps that even the Quest Pro has? Very surprised not to see some mention of this type of use case.

All up - it definitely sets the bar but I think it gives plenty of room for others to pitch cheaper but only slightly worse devices into the midrange ($1k-2k) where Quest Pro sits. I need to see someone wearing it in real life to understand how gawky it really looks. It looks very weird in the pictures and photos I've seen and I think it totally undoes all the work they've done to overcome the isolation etc with the EyeSight etc.>>><<<Was a FOV mentioned? At work and missing small bits of the presentation.>>><<<3499.99 .. wow.>>><<<I’m curious now - they mentioned using it to watch 3D movies, but no mention of how you get the content. Will Disney+ start streaming certain movies in 3D?  AFAIK the only way to get 3D content right now are the handful of 3D Blu-ray releases. And new 3D TVs aren’t even a thing anymore.>>><<<obviously talking about porn>>><<<All of a sudden the Q3 is looking pretty damn good. 

This vision thing better be cheap for what I’m seeing. I expect these limitations from AR glasses, not a vr headset with a tethered puck.>>><<<The price of 7 Quest 3's.>>><<<$3500 lol>>><<<Apple and cheap don't usually go together>>><<<The eyes are hilarious. Honestly seems like cool tech, but not really gonna change anything for VR gaming unless you can connect other VR controllers and integrate it with Steam.>>><<<This thing isnt made for gaming tho. Its, like every Apple product, primariy a Lifestyle and Productivity tool. And I think it looks pretty promising, tech wise, to evaluate this onto the next level.

The price tho is the thing that will hinder the mainstream spread. 3499$ is ALOT, even for Apple Hardcore fans>>><<<It's clearly not even made for VR.

It very quickly established itself as AR and I don't see this competing with any VR headsets for VR space in the same way that VR headsetes don't compete in AR(even if they are trying to).

This thing is a cousin to VR headsets but not a sibling.>>><<<I honestly didn't expect Apple to make such a large HMD, this is the aspect that disappoints me the most. I believe this will turn a lot of people off from buying it and adopting this platform, despite the specs being really amazing

Seems like a mistake to make the form factor so large>>><<<This thing looks amazing, and it is too bad that pcvr is almost definitely off the table, at least at first.>>><<<starting at 3499$ :D that's without taxes and battery lol>>><<<Oh the positive side - if it proves to be good enough, we will see proper implementation of VR desktops that are not hacked up $10 solutions that barely work.

On the realistic side - lmao. Price, battery life and everything else. You're not gonna sit with your loved one wearing this meme thing on your head to watch a romcom. You're not gonna wear it if you have a small kid that needs your attention. You're not gonna wear it in any situation that's not "I live alone" or "I'm in my home office working work".>>><<<&gt; Oh the positive side - if it proves to be good enough, we will see proper implementation of VR desktops that are not hacked up $10 solutions that barely work.

Time for Microsoft to reanimate the decaying corpse of WMR Portal, since that was doing exactly the same thing that Apple is doing now. Microsoft just kind of gave up on it for no reason and never even bothered to port it to OpenXR so it can be accessed from other headsets. Also Microsoft building a "Mixed Reality" brand of headsets, but kind of forgetting to enable any actual mixed reality functions, not a great idea. Still, if they hurry up they still have a chance to not be another Zune or Windows Phone, but they just fired almost everybody from the WMR teams, so probably not.>>><<<Even though I'll never own one because of the price, I hope it's successful. If it is then it'll mean more companies jumping on the bandwagon and could lead to an AR/VR arms race to do things better and cheaper.>>><<<If anyone remembers the first iPhone, it was basically a really slick iPod that made phone calls. It was nothing radically new until it got the App Store, and 3G internet capability. 

This may underwhelm a bit, right now, but I expect version 2 to knock it the rest of the way out of the park.>>><<<The price tag is ridiculously steep, but some of these features look great. A seemingly very well developed product with some impressive specs and tech. I imagine in a few years and with a few generations of refinement, this could be something special. First gen iPhone kind of sucked. First gen Apple Watch sucked. But they proved a concept and a few years later they had improved drastically in every aspect from software and features to processing and battery power, and changed their respective industries. First gen products always stink a bit and are never worth it for your average consumer, that’s just common knowledge in the tech world. 

I hope this kickstarts consumer interest in VR from OUTSIDE the enthusiast space it currently occupies. I think that’s kind of their goal. This specific model won’t be the device to bring AR/VR to the mainstream, but after a couple of generations of tweaking and the inevitable price drop, it just could be. I’m not overly excited about this headset as it stands, but I’m very excited about what they’re doing and what it will be like 3-4 years down the line.

Still, holy fuck… Too expensive.>>><<<Most people are butthurt by the price, which is understandable. But the technology and functionality is unprecedented. Should be amazing to use.

As a recap: 4k+ per eye, multiple virtual monitors for working in AR, eye tracking, pancake lens, video calls, 3d video recording and viewing.

Full integration with Apple ecosystem so you can use answer calls, text messages, or use any 3rd-party iPhone app in AR.

There isn't any other system that can do all this.>>><<<I did that in the Paris subway in 2015, with the first samsung Gear VR.

People called the cops on me.>>><<<Imagine becoming the biggest threat in a Paris subway by wearing a VR headset.>>><<<Especially in 2015>>><<<What were you doing with a headset in the subway?>>><<<maybe humping something in the air>>><<<relax, let the guy buy a sandwich>>><<<Well. What was he doing in 2015 with a headset, lmao
 That's an early adopter for sure>>><<<Gear VR released in 2015. I know a lot of people who had it.>>><<<You should have told them it was performance art.>>><<<Why did they call the cops on you??>>><<<The furious masturbation was a wee bit too much for the poor, poor French.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Are sunglasses also banned? Doesn't seem like a VR headset covers much more than that.>>><<<It also blocks the nose and sung glasses are somewhat see through aswell as you can look around>>><<<The fact that you wore that in public in Paris without having it stolen is astonishing>>><<<why the hell would anyone call the cops on you for that? weird ass people>>><<<A way to get mugged for sure.>>><<<Who's dumb enough to rob someone that everyone has their eyes trained on>>><<<A meth addict.>>><<<a crackhead>>><<<Nobody in London would give a fuck. They watch or film people getting mugged every day.>>><<<Same in brazil, once i was clearly getting robbed going back from school, people ignored

Thank god my phone was so shit the guy gave it back lmao>>><<<Muggers hate this one weird trick!! 😯>>><<<You underestimate the general public's desire to "not get involved">>><<<Everyone having their eyes trained on you would suggest it hasn't been normalized.>>><<<Once they hit the subway, it's just a matter of time.>>><<<They snatch it and run right before the train doors close. If they knew its price and knew they could sell it then they would snatch it for sure.>>><<<You haven't been to the bay area recently I see...>>><<<I’ve been out with my Vision Pro a few times. A couple people came up to ask me questions. I also got a ton of stares. I wasn’t mugged.>>><<<lol if you think the public would do anything>>><<<You have never been to London.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<After the mugging, For sale on EBAY later that week.>>><<<They couldn’t sell it because it’s locked.>>><<<Sorry to hear u live in such a shitty place>>><<<I’ve been to NYC countless times and I’ve never be robbed. There’s a certain group of Americans that like to pretend big cities are crime-ridden hellscapes.>>><<<They need to be able to sell this to people that live in shitty places in order to make a profit.

Believe it or not, you live in the minority of a safe area.>>><<<Not that I want to, but if I'd wear one in public here it would get ripped off my face>>><<<It would be worthless to whoever stole it, unless they just want to look at it.>>><<<Nope. They will sell it, someone will buy it, even if they know they need to attempt to break the activation lock.>>><<<&gt;normalize wearing a VR headset in public

I wouldn't go that far>>><<<What they're trying to normalize is spending $4000 on what amounts to a really heavy phone that you strap to your face. Can't use it like a VR headset while you're walking around anyway, it's just a big, awkward, and insanely priced smart phone.>>><<<I'm hella surprised they released the headset without their Maps app being turned into AR>>><<<Because they neither want nor expect people to be walking around outside wearing them. Maybe, at a stretch, in a park or public area in which you stand still.

Has any of their marketing at all been outside?>>><<<I have the Vision Pro and that’s honestly ridiculous to me. AR maps integrated into the headset would be amazing.>>><<<They're literally wearing them in public as a very pathetic way to show people that they own it.>>><<<Yeah, a few people wearing them in public isn't the same thing as this being normalized. Remember "Glassholes?" Here's a little secret, those people weren't assholes, they were just people wearing tech-glasses in public. And it freaked some morons the fuck out, and spawned an undeserved nickname for anyone wearing one just because some people are paranoid about being recorded in public / can't live with the fact that some dorks are willing to wear something that they themselves would never wear in public.

I know FOR SURE AVP will cause some people to get into fights soon. 

Moron: "Why do you keep staring at me, asshole?"

AVP Wearer: "Oh, no, I'm not staring at you I'm watching a video."

Moron: "No, asshole, you've been mad-dogging me for the past 5 minutes. Knock if off or I'm going to shove those ski-goggles up your ass!"

AVP Wearer: "No, you don't understand. I'm watching a video on a floating screen, I didn't even see you there at all."

Moron: \*Punches AVP Wearer\*>>><<<Life in 90 fov>>><<<That’s the main reason everyone should skip this gen.>>><<<You can't actually use it while walking, I guess you could use it on a treadmill but WHY, just listen to music and don't sweat on a 3k headset>>><<<Treadmill is one time it does make sense. Simulate walking through a nice environment. Throw in a fan and an air freshener, and you might forget you're in a basement or spare room for a few minutes. Same for exercycles and rowing machines.>>><<<Thing is way too big and heavy. You would’ve sweat all over the thing. I don’t believe for a second that it’s comfortable to actually workout with it. 

This is coming from a beatsaber fanatic. I would never take it to the gym.>>><<<I can't even wear over ear headphones without sweating up a storm all over them, no way I'm risking my expensive vr set at the gym.

I guess if you're so rich you don't care, but then you wouldn't be working out at a public gym.>>><<<It would be a flex of wealth using these while sweating in them. I'd be okay doing so on a 500 dollar device, but for a 3.5k device?>>><<<I work out with a Quest 1/2 and its not bad as long as you fit it properly and have good airflow in the room.>>><<<It’s fine with a rowing machine with Quest 3>>><<<My issue is the sweat + pressing against your face which could cause bad acne. I’m sure there are solutions for this though>>><<<I do this with my exercise bike and the GTA V vr mod. It's pretty incredible>>><<<I tried my quest 2 on a treadmill and it really doesn't work. The lenses immediately become foggy from the excess body heat, and your sweat makes it feel way too gross. Plus at all times you feel a certain discomfort from not directly seeing where you're walking, even if I was using that safety thing you clip to your clothes, and holding the handle of the treadmill.

Using a tablet is infinitely more convenient, and I'd even prefer using a laptop to watch videos over using a VR headset on a treadmill again.>>><<<I hear the bikes that connect to the software work well, the equipment tells the software how fast to move the scene so it feels immersive. I don't know, haven't tried it myself.>>><<<Liked using my q3 that way, no foggibg but I used a kiwi pro strap with battery and want to get a bobo with a fan, but for me it worked good no fogging, use my silicone strap from the q2 and might have to wipe it off a little after but ^^ idk if I am lucky with my face shape lol, the kiwi pro strap is better for working out I read so I got it because of that tho>>><<<If you don't want to be in a basement, just go have a walk outdoors? Unless there's severe weather I guess. 

I could see the headset being used to watch a show or something while on the treadmill. But I could just use a phone, seems better than to wear that thing during exercise.>>><<<A lot of people live in cities with no nice walking places around.>>><<<A lot of people live in suburban sprawl with no sidewalks.>>><<<That's a crime against humanity.>>><<<Welcome to Texas, pardner.>>><<<I use VZfit on Quest 2 quite a bit. Apart from the weather issue it enables you to walk/run/cycle anywhere in the world by converting Streetview data in to 3d. More interesting than walking past the same place for the 100th time and you can just pick up and play without worrying about making yourself presentable.>>><<<This is my dream. Walk through a canyon or stuff like a famous riverwalk or even just city streets or a beach. Could familiarize yourself with the area around your hotel for an upcoming vacation or just pretend like you have money to go on vacation 😂
Or walk/run the route of an upcoming or famous race course>>><<<It's pretty great but it's not without it's flaws. It's a subscription app, the 3d isn't always perfect (though it seems to have improved a lot) and you have to select your route in advance, you can't just randomly decide to change direction. Apart from that it's great. Google Earth VR is also incredible if you haven't tried that yet and it's free.>>><<<I know you can connect a bike trainer to gta 5 and ride around liberty city, that would be fun probably>>><<<Can you imagine the smell. Sweating on the headband. Yuck.>>><<<Or just people flexing that they bought a $3,500 toy.>>><<<Yep, this. Social status is the #1 selling point>>><<<Apple in a nutshell>>><<<This shows the opposite of high social status. It’s lame af.>>><<<"How will people know I own it if I don't wear it?!?"

Fucking losers>>><<<This. This needs to be higher. This is exactly what I came here to say.>>><<<Nailed it on the first try.>>><<<It’s all part of a viral marketing campaign and you are helping spread it>>><<<I live in NYC, I doubt it. I have actually seen about a dozen people wearing this thing who have not been being recorded.>>><<<The goal in a campaign like this is to get the public recording and reposting videos. An ebike company sent me a free ebike of I promised to ride it around in public a bunch and leave some reddit comments. I'm not saying all of them are plants but it's very likely at least some of them were if not most>>><<<Just seems weird to pay for that when there is people like me doing that for free…>>><<<Why would they need to be recorded for it to be marketing? The marketing is go out and normalize this product. The pictures and videos from random people are the icing in the cake>>><<<We should all want Apple to succeed here. Maybe we'll get Samsung/Sony/LG/Microsoft/Google/Panasonic/Philips/etc. in on the "spatial computing" action if this thing takes off. I'm all for it.>>><<<And do you have any proof of this?>>><<<Is that bad?>>><<<No.>>><<<3 different photos of people using the headset should not be considered “normalizing” behavior. Especially since the 3rd image is a snapshot from a video that gone viral, and the 1st image is some fan taking a picture of a YouTuber named Canoopsy making one of those "I &lt;VERB&gt; &lt;PRODUCT&gt; for 24 hours" videos but for the APV.

Seriously, how does anybody know if the people in these images are genuine end-users or are paid actors? All the people commenting on that Youtube short that the 3rd image came from was either ridiculing the stupidity of bringing such an expensive device onto the NYC subway of all places or mentioning that they’ll never risk bringing it outside if they ever owned one.>>><<<I scrolled past half a dozen of these on the reddit front page with people mostly mocking them

Not sure if its a viral campaign, but there is an idiot driving a tesla with one on, and that cant be good for marketing>>><<<I'm sure that he at least had the headset on driving mode.>>><<<There is no “driving mode”. That’s a leftover from the focus feature on their other devices, which sync to the headset. It’s meant for your phone to silence notifications and such.>>><<<they are engagement farmers. but I don't think this will stop>>><<<Right... people go out with their Quest headsets on and get called Questholes and ridiculed online, people do the same thing with AVP and it's suddenly visionary and great and should be normalised 🤔

The Cult of Apple really is a powerful thing 🙃>>><<<People using it in real life are being ridiculed online just not here>>><<<Nobody thinks anything about the people in those photos is cool or visionary.>>><<<Yeah exactly, its fucking weird.>>><<<It looks dumb but I want an AR world so I'm glad that Apple's reputation lets them blaze this trail.>>><<<Everywhere I’ve seen images of these, people have ridiculed them online too. 

I don’t even like Apple but Apple haters are something else.>>><<<This is just marketing>>><<<not  really...

he shows how he is using it  while walking through NYC. It's fucking interesting  tbh.>>><<<I cringed out half way through that>>><<<sure... but  imagine having this in 5-10 years.

mobile phones were cringe too in the 90s. now everyone and their goldfish do have at least one mobile phone.

This thing could be interesting in so many fields... esp. when other companies follow and the prices  dropp to 300-500$>>><<<&gt;mobile phones were cringe too in the 90s. now everyone and their goldfish do have at least one mobile phone.

I don't remember that ever being the case. I do remember people (me included) not seeing the point of them. But thats something completely different of course.>>><<<Define "normalize", please. There is nothing normal about this.>>><<<"From $US3499 or $US291.58/per month for 12 months Buy Apple Vision Pro" yeh i think if i had one I'd probably forgo using it while eating at a restaurant or travelling on train and leave it at home.>>><<<Normalize? Did you even read the comments under these outside of VR subreddits or on the YT vids? Unless its a vid that a tech youtuber posted the comments are mostly negative / commenting about utopia and this being super weird.

&amp;#x200B;

The best bet is on normal looking AR glasses, like Virtue or XReal - i can wear the latter in the gym and no one even notices if i hide the cable under the shirt. If there would be a set that would be clear and still be able to cast image (i would imagine it would need to be a really bright one, as with XReals etc you need to have a cover or be in a dark room for it to really work well), then you can call it normalizing. On top of some way of using it without weirdly tapping your hands in the air.>>><<<Google in 2013: "I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.">>><<<This and every other post on other subs is definitely an ad plant>>><<<Remembering life before the headsets is going to define the zoomer generation>>><<<"haha we used to watch videos on 5in screen lmfao?! ikr im be so old fr no cap">>><<<Honestly, I'm really excited to see what the future holds for us>>><<<I'd put money on all these just being marketing. You'd be surprised how many low key campaigns consist of paying someone to walk into a busy part of town and 'consume product'.>>><<<Let's see how many people are wearing them three months to three years out.>>><<<It's definitely a flex to casually do this at a restaurant. 

Practically though:

Depending on the material, those pristine white cloth head straps will absorb and feature dirt, sweat, oil, and whatever succulent cuisine / environment smells you spend a lot of time around, just like all cloth head straps. I hope the bands are washable.

With any MR solution, this does excite me that one day you'll be able to gather with friends and enjoy shared environment-aware MR experiences. It opens a lot of doors.>>><<<It's a very sad, pathetic flex>>><<<You have a very low bar for something becoming “normalized”>>><<<Yeah except dorks have been doing this since Quest.

So no Apple didn't normalize wearing a VR headset (Spatial computer is fucking stupid) on your face in public.>>><<<Until thieves realise people are out in public with $3500 worth of headset on their head.>>><<<It's not normalized. If it was normalized, people would not bother taking candid photos of people wearing these headsets. Your post proves the opposite.>>><<<I had so much fun using my GearVR on trains planes &amp; buses in 2014/2015>>><<<in the casey neistat video, he tried to use it on the subway and it didn't work. i was skeptical about this being a marketing campaign, but im pretty positive it is one now.>>><<<It didn't work for him on subway because he didn't turn on travel mode which would have allowed him to continue using the VP while on the move.

If that video was a paid marketing campaign wouldn't Apple have told him about the travel mode instead of letting him create the expectation that there's no way to use the VP in moving vehicles?


With that said, these aren't the result of a marketing campaign but rather just random people who want to go viral on the internet.>>><<<I used it on the NYC subway, with travel mode, and can confirm it works pretty well.>>><<<but how much is apple paying you to do that? /s>>><<<Very cool!>>><<<Just a hype train>>><<<Apple is a cool brand to teenagers.

No, wearing a headset has not been normalized. These are douchbags>>><<<“Normalize” is quite a stretch. Nothing about this is normal.>>><<<This is not normalized lmao>>><<<Great way to get jumped.>>><<<Surprised people are not getting jacked; considering the price.>>><<<It's not normalized. They look like idiots.>>><<<No. This is the 2024 version of neon skiing outfits and bula hats>>><<<It's not just because of the brand coolness. The Apple vision pro passthrough is kind of the only one good enough for wearing it in daily life>>><<<It's awesome to see, I'm loving all the hype and interest in the space>>><<<I wore my quest 3 at a Toyota dealership waiting on my car , place was packed with people . No one was even paying attention to me lol>>><<<Can the triple A studios make a fucking serviceable MMO now... Please... Zenith just died. And I'm bored now.>>><<<It's not normalized. A few people are trying out their new toy, that's all.>>><<<Just like Goole Glasses.>>><<<Hehe, fondly remember the 'glassholes' posts>>><<<Do you really think anyone who wears makeup will ruin their face for that, for example? Until they are a simple pair of glasses they'll never be normalised.>>><<<People get mugged in London for a Canada Goose coat. Going to be a field day when there’s £3k on your face and watching VR porn on the tube.>>><<<Lol how do we tell OP that these pics are staged for marketing purposes. Try actually wearing one in public and you’ll get robbed in under a second>>><<<Where do you live lol>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Could be trauma from growing up/living in bad locations my entire life, but I'll never wear something that expensive while out lol.>>><<<I would like this to continue to become more normal. Honestly, there are many situations where I would like to use my VR headsets where I don’t because it still seems weird or unusual. I want it to become normalized.>>><<<Why are people in the comments so mad that someone is using a vr headset in public...? What's so bad about it?>>><<<Cringe>>><<<I thought it  was cringe  when people started using  their mobile phones  back in the early 90s, because "who  can be that important that they need to be available 24/7?"

I thought it was cringe  to pay at the cashier with a card for a bottle e.g. Pepsi

I thought it was cringe when people started using blutooth headphones in public.

Is the vision pro cringe now? Yeah, kinda

Will it  be cringe in 5 years, when more companies will have devices like that? Not  really.>>><<<People have been using Quest 2's in public for 3 years....>>><<<This is viral marketing and everyone is falling for it.>>><<<It definitely makes sense on a treadmill, idk about a dinner table with another person but who knows, they might both be doing something cool like eating on the top of a 100 story building, if thats possible>>><<<Doesn't make sense on a treadmill because sweat will fog it up.

While eating is fucking regarded>>><<<That one actually made the least sense, how can anyone stand sweating into their headset?>>><<<You haven't played creed or thrill of the fight or any of the other hundreds of physical vr games obviously. People exercise in vr all the time.>>><<<I dunno about everyone else, but I take several precautions to not get my $400 Quest 2 very sweaty. New face plate that doesn’t absorb sweat. I also wear a headband to absorb forehead sweat as much as possible so it doesn’t drip down inside. 

No way I’d wear something as expensive as the Vision Pro while I exercise, especially with no third party, non absorbent facial interfaces yet. 

Although, I’d guess that most who already own a Vision Pro have more money than sense, so what do they care if they ruin it.>>><<<It makes sense in that there's a use case for it. Who goes out to lunch with someone and sits in a headset.>>><<<it wasn't too long ago that everyone wore masks for an entire year or more. So someone wearing a device that covers their eyes doesn’t really bother me. It looks kinda cool when it’s doing the aurora effect. Would’ve been nice if they had different headband and light seal colors. >>><<<Jesus, this comment section.... I'm not an apple fan, but the irrational level of hate for the AVP on this sub is kinda cringy.>>><<<Agreed. They are clearly over priced but if people want to pay a wad of cash and help make VR/AR popular at the same time, we should be cheering them on but attacking them.>>><<<If I saw someone wearing this in public I would actively avoid them>>><<<Real life Wall-E>>><<<I’m just waiting to see someone walking the grocery store with one.>>><<<People are too caught up in their “Apple bad 😡” mentality to realize this pushes VR as a whole forward lmao>>><<<Much rather own a quest 3 (I’m broke)>>><<<Just wait until all the returns because they were not careful, and the sunlight ruined the lens.>>><<<Not many seem to get the viral marketing Apple is pushing, this is to put VP into the FOMO category and I'm all for it because this will push VR more into everyone's mind and when they know they can't get the $3500 overpriced metal they will go for the cheaper one's and that helps drive sale overall.

This is same as how Android became so popular and Samsung pushed the envelope through that. So this is good for future VR>>><<<Normalize? After a few days and a few photos of the same few people?>>><<<That's not normal >>><<<While I'm not mad about the publication I love it I think it may be good for the vr community IF dicks don't ruin it,let's be honest this isn't going to end well 🤣>>><<<To be fair, the Vision Pro has the highest quality sensors on the market with one of the best mixed reality. Until this past year, most headsets didn’t have good mixed reality and standalone capabilities>>><<<First pic is a reviewer in Toronto. Some say it's a paid promotion which I doubt. I think Apple just sent them a copy much like any other big names.>>><<<Google glasses were better>>><<<I'm a little surprised there hasn't been a news piece on a snatch and run theft yet.>>><<<Imagine if apple made permanent dick enlargement pills>>><<<🤣🤣🤣🤣>>><<<Shipping a product that has a purpose outside of gaming and doing it well probably has more to do with it.  Meta has been shipping game consoles. This is a computer. They’re similar in a lot of ways, but in 2 days, I’ve probably used my Vision Pro more than my total time with Quest 2 and quest pro combined. This is what quest pro should have been. Could still be, but meta wants you to buy from them rather than expose the play store apps.>>><<<I guess if it costs 500$ is a peasants thing, if it costs 3500$ its cool and worth to show off.

 :D>>><<<This is one week of ‘influencers’ wearing the thing in stupid situations for the clicks and then it will stop. At least these two aren’t doing something actively dangerous like driving.>>><<<See no problem whatsoever, but yeah, keep poking Apple. Q3 was able to do it before AVP btw 🤣>>><<<Absolutely the same kind of images came out when quest 3 launched, **there is nothing new here**. You can look up the "meta glassholes" type of articles that came out at launch.

I would say, there were way more quest 3 examples out in the wild than the Apple one, so kinda weak. There was even a viral video of something crazy happening, and in the background there was just some guy chilling in his quest 3, not phased by it.>>><<<not normal.>>><<<I wouldn't call that normalized lol>>><<<This isn't normal.>>><<<When you're out, you should be present in the moment. There's enough to look at in the real world without adding all sorts of virtual layers on top of it. This isn't the future. The future is gaming and social networking while using VR devices at home, not in public. Meta is far closer to this vision than whatever Apple is playing at.>>><<<Apple's new marketing campaign.   No way these aren't staged.>>><<<Apple, this is not going to catch on lol

These people look absolutely ridiculous.>>><<<I remember people saying the same thing about mobile phones 30 years ago>>><<<Also air pods. I don't think it will catch on this generation but given time.>>><<<I remember when Samsung released the Galaxy Note 1 with a "massive" 5.3" display and people said that it looks ridiculous. Look at us now.>>><<<People used to universally hate anyone who used a cell phone to take a call in public. When the BlackBerry (“crackberry”) was the big thing everyone mocked how people were glued to the screen all the time. 

All of this is normal now.>>><<<I'm an old nerd so this looks more like I imagined the future as a kid. There need to be more jumpsuits though. Maybe food in pill form too.>>><<<Meh I hear u but honestly disagree. Top hats look ridiculous to us now but they were of the highest fashion for a long time, yeah? I’m betting things like this are ‘high’ fashion in next ten years>>><<<This is what people were saying when it was announced. Apple is a trend setter. Not on some fanboy shit, just straight up. The power they have to make the craziest shit completely normal is truly wild. 

AirPods we’re “ugly” when they were announced. Now it’s “weird” if you don’t have them and wireless headphones are pretty standard nowadays.

People were skeptical of the iPhone when it was first revealed. Now it’s one of the biggest items in the world and people will tease you about not having one. 

Apple Watch? Same thing. 

Apple making a vr headset was/is the best thing for vr because now it’ll become “normal” and more mainstream and normal people will actually know what vr is or at least have a better understanding of it. 

“vr? Oh yeah like that Apple thing?”>>><<<I think it's all marketing placement.>>><<<If anyone was going to get their customers to engage in this kind of cringe behaviour over technology, it was going to be Apple>>><<<Wo meta Quest 3 did it first by a few months and you ridicule it. Apple does it few months later and it's amazing. Are you guys stupid? I'd rather a 500 dollar headset that does the same as a 3500 dollar one... which is besides the point.. point is, just coz it's apple doesn't make it cooler>>><<<Only thing that stopped me from buying it was display port. I thought they would have a link variant like the 3rd had.>>><<<Missing DP was such a huge letdown.>>><<<The future is now, old man.>>><<<Same thoughts here too. Too unsure how it would be compared to my Reverb G2 over wifi🤷‍♂️ Be nice if i could at least try it first😅>>><<<Wait you can use a g2 over WiFi??>>><<<No I meant the pico 4. Like quality of pico with wifi>>><<<Oh gotcha>>><<<Its damn good actually. It replaced my HP reverb g2.>>><<<It is not an unpopular opinion, just a really lazy opinion with zero supporting details>>><<<Why Unpopular?  As long as you’ve found what works best for you that’s great imho.  VR headset comparisons are always subjective so what you find is best might not be the case with others.

In about a month’s time someone is bound to say that their nice new Quest 3 is the best VR headset ever.  I hope that person is me, lol!>>><<<True 
I sincerely hope so>>><<<I've never tried another so I can't compare. But I'm very happy.>>><<<Quest Pro is superior in almost every way.>>><<<Also like thrice the price, originally.>>><<<From what I have read about the P4, you are 100% correct. The only place P4 wins is price and am happy to pay for real Touch controllers.>>><<<Not in resolution, not in color passthrough, not in weight…
Quest pro’s passthrough is a joke!>>><<<Not sure why you are being down voted. 

Quest pro is heavy and has worse comfort overall. And pico 4 is higher resolution, its a pretty significant bump in resolution too.

Neither pass-through is particularly good 🤷‍♂️.

(I expect quest 3 to be better than both)>>><<<From what Pico 4 owners have said, I would much rather have Quest Pro's grainy but prospective correct passthrough than Pico 4's nausea inducing mess.

and another: https://www.reddit.com/r/QuestPro/comments/z6rmci/quest_pro_vs_pico_4_passthrough/

&gt; Now to the bad part: it's absolutely and utterly disorienting. Walking around with passthrough on feels like being on a psychedelic trip.

**Edit...** Looks like they have improved it greatly over the last 9 months. This guy loves it: https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/16kekrp/the_more_i_use_vr_passthrough_the_more_i_like_it/>>><<<Quest Pro's passthrough is actual 3d stereo cameras with a color camera overlay, it may not look as good to you, but comparing them as if they are the same and one is just more pretty is crazy, one has actual depth to it and is mapping out the room, and does do some neat stuff even while people give it shit for not having the depth sensor, then depth map it does built is much better than no map at all like the pico.>>><<<It's being dropped by Meta. So long term support is dubious at best.>>><<<Tbf long term support for pico hasn't been proven either>>><<<True, but the product hasn't been canceled. Pico, as a company, has been making headsets at least as long as Meta, and the Pico 4 is a 4th generation product. They are a VR headset company, that is their main business. We're still waiting on the Quest 3.>>><<<Not as long as oculus no. The pico 4 store is completely new, and is the first hmd under bytedance>>><<<Pico was always a VR headset company before being acquired by Bytedance. Their focus on earlier products was on the corporate space, as opposed to the consumer retail space. It was only after the Bytedance acquisition that they started to have a more consumer focus. Pico Interactive was started in 2015 in the San Francisco Bay area so they've been around for 8 years now. So while not as old as Oculus, they're not exactly the new kid on the block either.>>><<<For a feature packed headset, yes.

For a used Quest pro (usually 600-700), you get a Pimax Crystal with worse resolution and connection BUT you get superior lenses, controllers and standalone. You can't really beat that.>>><<<Not in cheapness and in many aspects it's a tie.>>><<<While I agree that the Pro is better in many ways, this post is about 1 month away from the Quest3 launch, where it is looking to be a WAY better deal than the Pico 4 in everyway possible, obviously we should all wait and see, but we are 1 month from a new Quest release and when is the Pico 5 coming out? 

It was pretty obvious to many paying attention that the PICO seemed to be rushed out to beat the Quest3 to market, and once they did I do not thing Meta was rushed to get the Quest3 out right away. The Quest3 is going to be very hard to beat for the money for awhile, it is the most you are going to get for $500 for some time to come, just look at the specs on it.>>><<<problem with q3 being single panel, low fov like q2. slightly boosted res is not going to put it over the edge.>>><<<100% superior>>><<<I purchased a Pico 4 about 2 weeks ago. Over wireless the video quality was awful and there was terrible lag. And I have gigabit internet. I experienced much of the same with a wired connection. For PCVR it was awful. As a standalone headset it works as it should and is very good. I found it extremely uncomfortable though until I replaced the standard face gasket.

Ended up buying a DPVRE4 for PCVR and it is a brilliant headset. I found a discount code and purchased it from their US website which after all calculations brought the price down to £360 which is a bargain. 

The controllers and tracking are great
The headset is light and easy to set up
The resolution (even though advertised the same as quest 2) is fantastic as it has Display port connection. Image is nice and sharp and even the smallest of text is very easy to read. Crystal clear image and I've noticed zero screen door affect.

Honestly if anyone is stumped for what headset to buy for PCVR and isn't bothered by a wired connection. This headset for its price point is unbeatable IMO.>>><<<Your internet speed doesnt matter for wireless PCVR, your local network matters>>><<<Perhaps you could elaborate for me? I don't really understand all of it. All I wanted was a headset I can play PCVR with. My son recommended the Pico so I got it but had nothing but unpleasant experiences whilst trying to play on PC.>>><<<First of all, you should have a good  Wi-Fi 6 router reserved for the exclusive use of the Pico 4. You connect to the router wirelessly with the headset, and your PC should be connected to the router via ethernet cable.

Finally you need to use VirtualDesktop client on your Pico 4, and VirtualDesktop server software on your PC. That is the the best way to get a high quality wireless PCVR experience.>>><<<So I have a WiFi 6 router in my house but my VR room is not in the house. It's about 25 feet away down the bottom of the garden. I have a WiFi extender in there and run an ethernet cable from that to the PC. I have literally zero knowledge and understanding of wireless routers. It's not possible for me to run an ethernet cable from my house to my garden room. I was considering ethernet plugs that transfer the connection through my home electrical wiring but I'm not sure if that's going to work/help? If not what else could I do? As mentioned before I have the DPVRE4 now and I'm quite happy with it for my room scale stuff but if I could get Pico 4 working perfectly I'd use it on my SIM rig.>>><<<So your connection to the internet does not matter much here, it is streaming between your PC that is playing the game and the Headset, so it is that connection that matters. To maximize that connection you don't want your PC and your headset to both be on the wireless. 

To me it sound like your Internet is up at your house and you garden house in down somewhere, that is all fine, I do not know what hardware you are using, but ASUS makes what I would tell most people to get, cause I have had good luck with them. ASUS has a feature that make one router connect to the other like a extender, so what I would do is, buy 2 ASUS WIFI6 routers of same type and make sure they support AIR MESH. Put one at your house and then connect it to the other down the hill with AIR mesh, they will both be controlled buy the single router up the hill, all LAYER3 IP address type settings on on the main router up the hill where your internet connection is. 

The import ant part is that down the hill you plug your PC that I also assume here is down the hill close to your headset, but either way plug your PC in to either router vis a Ethernet cable! Then make sure you headset is connected to that local WIFI6 router, it should see that as the strongest WIFI6 SSID, I always make my WIFI6 SSID different than my older  2.4 gig, and really only put devices on that WIFI6 freq if they need it, try to not use that same connection while using headset etc. It is OK to share the connection if you manage what is on it smart and you are aware of what is going on on your network. The ASUS admin page tells you what is connected to each freq, and by cable off what of the 2 routers.

If you don't understand all this, that is fine, but honestly your not going to get a good streaming experience if you think your just going t plug in to WIFI in just any setup and it will work, your going to have to understand some things.>>><<<I don't want to use my Pico 4 wirelessly. I want to use it with a wired connection whilst in my SIM rig. I have another dedicated hard wired headset I use for room scale stuff. Even whilst having Pico 4 tethered to pc via USB C the compression looks like a shitty YouTube video. If I could get it to work via a cable perfectly I would use it as my dedicated SIM rig headset>>><<<So you started your complaint with how the headset doesn't work well over WIFI, and because your internet was slow, so people were trying to help. It seems you don't understand a lot about the networking so asked to have some explain. Now you dont want it at all. Not sure what to say, but I don't have a Pico4 I use a Auest Pro, but don't really trust your option given you dont seem to know what you want or anything about what your talking about honestly.>>><<<Well to be honest with you you obviously haven't read the entire thread. I started saying how I've had a terrible experience with the Pico 4 over wireless and wired, then I went on to say how I already have a hard wired PCVR headset that I'm using. Other people jumped on board and started trying to teach me about wireless vr and how to set It up and such. I never asked anyone to do that. I simply asked people to explain what they were saying because I didn't understand. I never once said I wanted my Pico 4 as a wireless PCVR headset but as people were replying to me in a lingo I don't understand I simply asked them to elaborate to help further my knowledge on the subject, so... back in your box mate>>><<<Well you don't have wireless set up optimally for vr, so you are bound to have problems with wireless.

Yeah a dedicated wired device like dpvr or reverb g2 are better at wired...>>><<<You don't seem to have done your own homework with regards to the product you purchased versus your use case. If your goal was to have a wired headset, the Pico 4 probably should not have been your first choice. The Pico 3 Neo has a dedicated display port connection and that probably would have suited you better.

However, since you do have a Pico 4, the people on this thread, including myself, have been trying to help you get the best wireless experience, because with the proper setup you can use the Pico 4 wirelessly and get results as good as a wired connection. Given the choice, I prefer wireless because I don't have to be limited by dangling cables. YMMV. If you're still stuck on using a wired setup with your Pico 4, you can Google plenty of YouTube videos or search Reddit for how to do that through Pico's Streaming Assistant app.

If you are willing to listen to people on this thread with experience using the Pico 4, we can probably get you sorted. You can take it or leave it, up to you.

First, your internet connection speed to your PC isn't relevant to the Pico 4 wireless use case. If your PC requires an internet connection powerline ethernet equipment is readily available and is relatively cheap. Otherwise using a Wi-Fi 6 router to connect to your main router is also doable. In any case you should have a dedicated Wi-Fi 6 router for the Pico 4 to use.

Second, your PC should be physically connected via ethernet cable to the Wi-Fi 6 router your Pico 4 will connect to.

Third you need to purchase VD (Virtual Desktop) from the Pico store and install it on your Pico 4 headset. Then download the VD desktop PC software and install on your PC. Do not buy VD from Steam or anywhere else. It won't work.

There are already dozens  of videos about how to configure VD for use on Pico 4. You can find those guides on YouTube. If you get everything set up correctly you will have a great wireless experience.>>><<<Herein lies your problem, a Wi-Fi extender probably does not offer the wireless bandwidth required to have a good wireless experience in the Pico 4. There is a reason people are telling you to get a Wi-Fi 6 router. You need a high bandwidth 5Ghz connection to your Pico 4 to get good wireless results.

You don't need to go overboard on the Wi-Fi 6 router. A 1200-1800 Mbps unit is more than enough since it's basically only being used by your headset.>>><<<Wireless PCVR streams between your PC/laptop and your headset. The data travels from PC to router to headset. It doesn't leave your local network. So your internet subscription speed doesnt matter. What matters is the speed of the elements in your local network. A wired (ethernet) connection between PC and router is best, but verify that both PC and router support at least 1gbps, which is common on all modern routers. Also, your router should support wifi 6 for best quality, as it supports higher data throughput.>>><<<Unfortunately some fiddling could be required to get a good experience for pcvr using the pico.
First, the software pico uses to stream from the pc to the pico isn't that great, that is why people always recommend virtual desktop which offers better image quality.
Besides, since a constant transfer of lots of mbps is required you need a router that's at least wifi 5 capable that doesn't have other devices connected to it. (although some may be connected, they shouldn't be consuming much bandwidth)>>><<<How is the display quality compared to the quest 2?>>><<<Pico has much wider FOV. I did use Q2 at setting 3 and hardly get 85deg measured, The pico with AMVR interface is around 100 for me. Edge to edge clarity is much better because of the use of pancake lenses and the fact you have a real IPD adjustment that goes all the way to 72mm.

I still use my Quest2 a lot as the Pico4 is pretty much only used as for PCVR, the Pico store is still barren compared to Quest, and I have already invested into the Oculus/meta ecosystem.>>><<<I'm the opposite, I use my Q2 to watch movies 90% of the time and for PCVR the rest of the time (that is almost never nowadays). I think Pico may be a good option for me>>><<<[removed]>>><<<[removed]>>><<<I was going to buy it but after seeing that product I had a feeling like" here is advanced brick there is few games so don't complain". I'm not saying that's a trash headset its for now the  best Budget PCVR  but on standalone side meta is winning also pico didn't show anything new or innovating. Meta had hands tracking and then pico it's going to be the same with AR meta has it so next pico will have it. You might say it's like the homework meme. 
It might be better then original but different approach 
But for me the deal breaker was that meta is investing in VR/AR Pico just follow....>>><<<Question 2 what hmd do you own ?>>><<<Great device indeed. I own it. But I still prefer the Quest Pro. Better image quality, eye tracking and, specially, software. But yes, Pico 4 would be my second option right now>>><<<It's a fine opinion. I disagree, but it's all subjective :)>>><<<I agree with this. It's a great product that doesn't get the recognition.>>><<<I would use it more if it had some kind of DisplayPort support>>><<<It's very good. I'd say it might be the best value for money but not the best headset ever.>>><<<Is it a really good hmd for the price? Yeah, sure, sounds about right.

The *best* hmd out there? Absolutely not, pico 4 ain't ever gonna be able to compete with the likes of the pimax 12k, bigscreen's beyond, Varjo's aero, etc. There's a range of ridiculous headsets out there that leave any current mass market headset in the dust.>>><<<Pimax Crystal is too bulky and heavy, Bigscreen Beyond has too small horizontal fov, and Varjo Aero has too small vertical fov. Can’t do wireless with the latter two. Pico 4 strikes the best balance between good fov and small comfortable form factor while also having above average resolution and wireless pcvr and standalone capabilities. It’s the best all rounder, and yes very affordable.

Edit: oh you said Pimax 12K. Does that exist?>>><<<1. Oh, my bad, the pimax reality 12k is the proper name, basically the wired counterpart to the pimax crystal. (In late development, hasn't been released to the general public yet)


2. that's one way of looking at it. I'll agree with you there, it definitely is one of, if not the best HMD when it comes to being a jack of all trades. I do still side with the fact that different users will have different preferences that will most of the time result in another headset being a much better match, but I suppose that's just a different way of looking at how we should use technology.


3. To me at least, Standalone VR won't be an actual selling point until they start putting laptop parts in the headsets. As long as snapdragon based headsets running android stay the norm, I'll just see it as an extra feature that brings the rest of the headset down with it. (I say this knowing that I have a quest 2 and pico 4 just sat on my desk right now).>>><<<What can you play on it?>>><<<Mmm, I think A LOT of people are enjoying the Pico 4 tbh. It's too bad both of my orders had faulty, warped lenses so I gave up on it.>>><<<This is 2023. Everything is spying on you. Your phone, your laptop, your browser (yes, even in incognito mode)... Unless you are living in China AND actively saying how bad it is and planning a coup right now, you have nothing to be afraid of (at least no more than from your phone or browser).>>><<<&gt;Unless you are living in China AND actively saying how bad it is and planning a coup right now, you have nothing to be afraid of

I think the bigger threat is digital information warfare. Think of the possible ramifications of Titok/Pico users having every aspect of their private lives leaked publicly. Suddenly everyone is against each other and we implode from the inside.   


Remember when southpark did an episode following a similar premise? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9DhlCuZnc>>><<<Why would ByteDance or the chinese government leak Pico users private lives publicly? They would lose all their gains, and they would get literally nothing in return.>>><<<I really don't mean to sound rude so sorry if what I'm about to say comes off that way, but you understand that pretty much every other week the U.S and China are measuring each others dicks, calling every small thing that the other does an act of war, right?

Obviously myself and pretty much everyone should not want these countries to go to war but if they did, China could start off by pitting U.S citizens against each other using this tactic, weakening the country and causing turmoil.

EDIT: I'd also like to add that Tiktok would probably be the bigger weapon, considering it has considerably more U.S users than the PICO, but you get the idea.>>><<<No way. Maybe they would leak out some info about political leaders, but they wouldn't get that info from their Pico headsets, they would get that info from their phones (which is already made in China 99% of the time).>>><<<Well I'm more of concerned about the Link software going through my PC data and sending them away (photos, files, etc.) or doing same with my keystrokes like passwords etc.>>><<<Your browser already sent away your keystrokes (twice, if you have an adblocker), and your phone could have already sent away your photos, but it probably didn't. Storage is still not that cheap, neither the US nor China transfers all the data of their whole population to themselves. There are not enough people in the world to look through all of it, and if they use machine learning it will only stop on you if you are planning something against the government. Again, you should only be afraid if you are a terrorist (or if you live in China AND spread infos about them they don't want you to spread)>>><<<Valid points. Do you think Pico is different from, let's say, Lenovo?>>><<<ltt just got hack from something similar lol using section keys>>><<<Maybe its a threat if you work for the Czech government. I don't see how China skimming your data will affect your life outside of China. You have to worry more about your own government accessing your data imo.>>><<<It allows China to conduct corporate espionage, blackmail and many other things designed to bolster the influence and power of the CCP.>>><<<In that case we should all be luddites.>>><<<What espionage will they be conducting from my VR headset tethered to my gaming PC? I'm just unconvinced that they are more a threat to you, barring gov employment, than say your own government spying on your messages/searches/etc>>><<<Yup absolutely. It possesses the exact same threat TikTok does. I've been trying to tell the VR Community about this for ages. I know that Meta should not be allowed to achieve a monopoly on standalone, but Chinese Tech Companies are forced to carry out the will of the CCP, a government commiting genocide against Uigher Muslims as I write this comment and is also planning to invade the independent nation of Taiwan. That means they're forced to limit freedom of speech and criticism of the CCP on their platforms. The last thing the tech industry needs is a dictatorship getting it's foot into it.>>><<<Valid points. What is your view on western companies using China as a manufacturing place and laying in bed with them? Sadly, with how the companies do these days, you can't eliminate China though. Would be nice if yes, but companies are a bit hypocritical in this.>>><<<Well, here's the thing, many countries like the USA are trying to move their businesses out of China and into India instead because of the threat China poses to global peace and democracy. India on the other hand is significantly more democratic than China and is a perfect candidate to replace them and uphold the world's demands for manufactured goods.>>><<<Hope it will work out, although even India could be problem, give to boiling Pakistan-India tensions>>><<<Isn't half of Pakistan underwater? Or at least it was a few months ago (time flies). Either way, I really don't think Pakistan is prepared for a major conflict against India (and I heavily doubt China is prepared to support Pakistan in it).>>><<<There is valid nuclear threat in that region>>><<<Eh most of it is desert. I'm sure we'll be fine 😅

(The above is a joke)>>><<<I would not hold up India as a paragon of virtue. You complain about China's "genocide". What do you think has been happening to Muslims in India for decades? Do you know why there's a Pakistan?

Also, India is one of the big reasons that Russia hasn't been that effected by the sanctions. Because India doesn't honor the sanctions. Their purchase of Russian oil has hit all time highs since the Ukraine war started. Not just by 10%, not just by 50% but by more than 100% over what it was before the war. They get around international sanctions by paying for that oil in Rupee instead of in dollars like everyone else. India has always aligned itself with Russia. It's not just a one way street. Trade between India and Russia is booming right now. Many Rusisan products find a ready market in India. Russia is their arms supplier.

A "perfect candidate"? I consider many other countries more perfect. Why not Mexico?>>><<<Eh Mexico too (that'd save a lot on shipping as well). Also it's us British who are responsible for the existence of the conflict between India and Pakistan (oops). Although I will admit you have a point about India's purchases of Oil.>>><<<It’s just a race to the bottom with shifting goal posts isn’t it? Oh China and India are too inhumane, let’s go to Mexico and fuck them up for a bit until we choose new goal posts.      
      
Your observation is correct, it’s just fucked up isn’t it?>>><<<Yay! Let's run from the communist dictator into the open arms of the world's largest scammer population...

Trust me, I know the USA is full of lying greedy bastards that would skin their mother alive on a live stream for an extra $10, im not saying we are any better only that we may not need to bother moving out of china...>>><<<&gt; Chinese Tech Companies are forced to carry out the will of the CCP

In the US, all companies are forced to carry out the will of the US government. We call that "regulations". Some of which require them to turn over their data to the US government on demand. No warrant required.

&gt;  a government commiting genocide against Uigher Muslims as I write this comment 

And yet we have more people in prison than China. Both in relative and absolute terms. Considering the US is a quarter the size of China and yet has more people in prison says something don't you think? Also, we have a 400 year on going genocide against native Americans. As you wrote that, you are probably occupying land that was forcibly taken and the previous residents killed. We are still taking their land by force.

https://www.tribdem.com/keystone-pipelines-path-cuts-across-native-american-land-history/article_c49dcbfa-e322-57bf-b1bd-b5fd04696587.html

&gt; and is also planning to invade the independent nation of Taiwan. 

Answer these questions. How many countries has China invaded in the last 50 years? How many countries has the US invaded in the same time?>>><<<Well compared! But it doesn't alter the security threats.>>><<<No it doesn't. But the same security and privacy concerns are involved when dealing with any company. There's little difference in terms of that between TikTok and Facebook. So if someone is concerned about TikTok, they should be just concerned about Facebook.

Personally, being pro privacy, I don't use either TikTok or Facebook.>>><<<Pro Privacy and you defend the CCP 💀💀💀>>><<<China has stronger privacy protections than the US. That's another thing you are ignorant of. You're on a roll.>>><<<If I were to criticize the US Government in public whilst standing in Washington I doubt anything at all would happen to me. If I were to criticize the CCP in China whilst standing in Beijing, then I would absolutely be arrested. China has hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras (four times that of the USA's) and has tight regulations over digital communication. Do you have any proof that China cares more about privacy than the US?>>><<<&gt; Do you have any proof that China cares more about privacy than the US?

Look at their privacy law. It's very similar to the EU GDPR law. Ask anyone that's had to comply with Chinese privacy laws and you'll get an earful of how effective it is. The EU has ruled against Facebook due to privacy concerns. They have not done so against China.>>><<<Because Facebook is a company that the EU can pretty easily regulate, while China is one of the largest governments and is the largest supplier of exports.>>><<<No. Europe trades more with the US than China. China isn't even 2nd.

It's because Facebook is a US company and the US has very little privacy protection. Very little. Particularly against the government. Since any data in a US based company is available to the US government. Which was the point of the EU ruling. That US companies have little to no protection of their data from the US government. Which is why people seriously concerned about privacy, avoid any US based company.>>><<<Same here and totally agree with you.>>><<<Firstly, if TikTok did abide by these regulations, then why was Bytedance being forced to sell TikTok to an American Company in 2020? 

Secondly, it's very bold of you to assume that the land in the middle of the British countryside that I'm living in was taken forcefully from natives. US Crime rates are higher than China's but that's because of how strict and repressive it is in China (FYI, you don't really get freedom of speech/expression in China), since the regime has bent it's population into submission since the CCP came to power (and honestly I'd rather have high "crime" rates than live under the CCP). I don't see what crime rates have to do with cultural genocide either. Yes, Native Americans are still experiencing cultural genocide to this day, but does that really excuse what the PRC is doing? 

Finally, this is a stupid question to ask. China (in the last 50 years) has tried to invade Vietnam twice. On the other hand, the USA has invaded Panama, Haiti, Grenada and Kuwait (technically Iraq). However, China and the USA had very different goals in mind when carrying out these invasions. Whilst the USA invaded these nations to restore democracy disrupted by military coups (In Haiti, plus this was sanctioned by a UN Security Council Resolution), Communist Insurgents (Grenada), invading foreign powers (Kuwait, Iraq invaded Kuwait illegally) or to detain and bring to justice known criminals (Panama,  Manuel Noriega was wanted for and charged with Crimes against Humanity and Drug Trafficking); China's invasions only served to boost the influence and power of the nation through land grabs. Last time I checked, China has *17* border disputes with other nations. Thankfully, they cannot act on them due to organisations like the UN (which would annihilate their economy with sanctions if they ever tried to do that) but if we didn't have such an establishment, I'd bet China would be declaring war against every country it shares a border with. 

In conclusion, you can fuck right off to China if you want to defend the CCP.>>><<<&gt; Firstly, if TikTok did abide by these regulations, then why was Bytedance being forced to sell TikTok to an American Company in 2020? 

First off, TikTok has not been sold. To an American Company or anyone else. If it had, then why would the US government still be talking about banning it for being a Chinese company?

"**TikTok**, and its Chinese counterpart Douyin[2] (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a short-form video hosting service **owned by the Chinese company ByteDance**."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok

&gt; Secondly, it's very bold of you to assume that the land in the middle of the British countryside that I'm living in was taken forcefully from natives.

Second, I guess you don't know the history of Britain. Britain was conquered. Multiple times. The first peoples there were subjugated. They were forced to live in new ways. Their culture was destroyed. It was a cultural "genocide". What is now called "English" isn't native to Britain. It is the language of the conquerors. It was brought by the Anglo-Saxons. It's ancestry is Germanic. Not the native languages that have been pretty much wiped out in what is now called "Britain".

&gt; On the other hand, the USA has invaded Panama, Haiti, Grenada and Kuwait (technically Iraq)

Ah... you left out Afghanistan. Also, we have had some "police actions" in plenty of other countries. Have you heard of Vietnam and Korea?

In conclusion, you are the result of you ignorance. Garbage in, garbage out. Garbage aptly describes you.>>><<<Firstly I never said it had been sold, but it was pressured into being sold. The only reason it wasn't was because the US got distracted by the funny Orange Man impeachment (allowing TikTok to resume business as usual in the USA, until now thankfully).

Secondly, it has been almost a thousand years since 1066. If we're counting that as "cultural genocide", then I think a good 90% of nations on the planet have had genocide committed in them (a tad bit dramatic). 

And finally, you are one sick mother fucker if you're defending the Taliban. Just as a heads up, even China is in the war against Terror. Also, you asked me about invasions in the last 50 years, not beyond that, however the point of the invasion remained the same. A Communist Revolution disrupts a peaceful capitalist democracy and the USA is asked (by the legitimate government being threatened) to help fight against it. 

If defending the USA makes me garbage, so be it. However I cannot imagine what kind of cess pool of a person you are, that you are outright defending the actions of the Taliban and Chinese Communist Party.>>><<<First off, then why did you bring it up? Other than you like to bring up pointless things.

Second, you implied that you are from Britain. Are you not? If so, then how can you not know of the people that still feel oppressed by the conquerors and are trying to break free. I only lived in the UK for a while and that was obvious. Aren't many of the Scottish, the Welsh and of course the N. Irish wanting to be free?

And finally, when did I defend the Taliban? Point that out. Do you ever get tired of making up shit?

Yes, what China is doing is done in the name of the war on terror. Wow. I'm honestly shocked you know that. So how come we are angels when we do it, but they are the devil when they do it?

No, defending the US doesn't make you garbage. Doing so based on your made up garbage "facts" is what makes you garbage. That's what people like the Taliban do. You know, the people you bring up all the time. You sound like someone's who smitten. I think the Taliban are just like you, garbage.>>><<<I brought it up to demonstrate that TikTok was NOT abiding by the regulations set out by the US Government.

Also, other nations in the UK are able to leave whenever they want after holding a referendum that says their general population wants to leave. However that hasn't happened. There is no one being oppressed by conquerers as far as we are concerned (for the most part I thought we were the ones doing the oppresing 💀)

"Ah... You forgot Afghanistan". Here, I assumed that you hold a very negative view of the US' interference of the Taliban regime and therefore assumed you staunchly supported the Taliban (because for what other reason would you oppose an invasion that gave women and education in Afghanistan for a very considerable amount of time). 

China's genocide of Uighur Muslims is not a part of their war on terror. Do keep in mind this is the largest-scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since World War II. I heavily doubt that the CCP would need to conduct something like this to prevent "terrorism".

And I would love to know which statements I make are "made up garbage".>>><<<&gt; I brought it up to demonstrate that TikTok was NOT abiding by the regulations set out by the US Government.

When has the US ever accused TikTok of not abiding by US regulations? Link please? The fear is that they are abiding by Chinese regulations too. That's the problem. So you "demonstrated" something you made up.

&gt; Also, other nations in the UK are able to leave whenever they want after holding a referendum that says their general population wants to leave.

LOL! That requires them to get permission from the UK to hold a referendum. It's like asking your captor for the key to your cell.

&gt; "Ah... You forgot Afghanistan". 

Yeah, because that's a country you forgot to say we invaded. Did the US not invade them?

&gt; Here, I **assumed** that you hold a very negative view of the US' interference of the Taliban regime and therefore **assumed** you staunchly supported the Taliban

Which sums you up. You assume. You make things up. To you, "facts" are just your feelings.

&gt; China's genocide of Uighur Muslims is not a part of their war on terror.

LOL. You just said it is. Because it is. There are Muslims all over China. All over. Why would they just pick on Muslims just there and no where else? There's history there. But I'm not surprised you don't know about it.

It's true you need permission from the government to hold a referendum, the last time anyone did, they voted in favour of staying in the UK.

The US did invade them but if you don't think the Taliban is a good thing then there is absolutely nothing wrong with the invasion. It's just pointless to bring it up, that's all.

I know about the history and the terrorism present in that region, however I don't think the incarceration of more than one million Muslims (without any form of legal process, by the way) helps to deescalate terrorism in the region without ruining the lives of countless communities and families. 

Just to bring the two of us back to reality real quick, we are debating world politics on a subreddit for VR Headsets. We should probably find some middle ground and draw this to a close (as we have gotten VERY far off track).

Let me explain my viewpoint: I believe that Chinese influence in Western tech markets is a very bad thing due to the current authoritarian regime in power there. I believe that China controls companies like Tencent and Bytedance, using them to collect data for espionage (something China is well known for doing a lot of). 

You explain yours and we'll see if we can agree on something (because I don't think either of us want this wall of text to keep descending).

Where in that article do they say that TikTok violated any US regulations? That's what you claimed they did. What it says is that US regulators are concern that TikTok is following Chinese regulations. Which is what I said. So you just provided a link that disproved what you claimed and backed up what I claimed.

If you feel otherwise, please quote where it says in that article says that TikTok violated any US regulation.

&gt; It's true you need permission from the government to hold a referendum, the last time anyone did, they voted in favour of staying in the UK.

That was under the fact that the UK was in the EU. Scotland voted to stay in the EU. Since if they had separated from the UK, then they would no longer be in the EU. We both know what happened after that vote. And ever since, many people in Scotland feel misled.

I think we can both agree that Brexit is a material change. With such a change, why not let Scotland have another referendum? They want it. But Britain won't allow for it.

How many millions did the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq effect? All in the name of the war on terror. Not to mention all the other countries in the region that were destabilized. In the end, did any of that deescalate terrorism in the region. It sure did ruin and take the lives of countless communities and families.

&gt; Let me explain my viewpoint: I believe that Chinese influence in Western tech markets is a very bad thing due to the current authoritarian regime in power there. I believe that China controls companies like Tencent and Bytedance, using them to collect data for espionage (something China is well known for doing a lot of). 

My viewpoint is that your viewpoint is based on, no offense this time, ignorance. You think the relationship Chinese companies have with the Chinese government is vastly worse than the relationship between US companies and the US government. When the truth is, they are pretty much the same. Yes, the Chinese government has access to the data of Chinese companies. Similarly, the US government has access to the data of US companies. One big difference is that a Chinese company can tell you they gave your data to the Chinese government. A US company doesn't dare do that under penalty of a prison term. Since what accompanies a demand to a US company for it's data by the US government is often a gag order. They are not allowed to discuss it.

In the eyes of the EU. China is less of a threat than the US. Since the EU has seen fit to take action against Facebook. In the ruling, they specifically said they were concerned about US government surveillance using data gathered about EU citizens. On the other hand, China's privacy law(PIPL) is so similar to Europe's GDPR that it's colloquially known as China's GDPR.

As I've said, I'm pro-privacy. So far from defending China on data gathering, I condemn it. But, and this is what separates you from me, I acknowledge that the US does the same. I condemn that too. I condemn both. You condemn one, while at the same time defend the other for doing the exact same thing.>>><<<Yeah but America doesnt have literally prison Camps where they force you to work to death what you are doing is basically: oh im gonna dismiss everything the guy said and point out how america did oopsies too. I dont think this method works tho? Genocide is always bad. Just because America did it to does not make Chinas crimes less awful.>>><<<I guess you didn't read where I said that the US has more people in prison than China. What do you think all those people do while in prison. Eat bonbons and watch soaps on TV? They work. Its not optional. Labor in US prisons is mandatory. In fact, the US government sells prison labor as a product. Imprisoned with forced labor, isn't that what you are talking about?

Here's where you can order your own prisoners to do labor directly form the US government.

https://unicor.gov/

Many states also run their own websites to sell prison labor in state prisons.

&gt; Just because America ~~did~~ does it to does not make Chinas crimes less awful.

FIFY.>>><<<I dont really care dude. And im not reading your post. China is doint bad stuff and ameria is doing bad stuff.

You should acknowledge both problems I agree, but don't try to excuse the Chinese government...>>><<<I absolutely am not. I do acknowledge that both have problems.

Probably a bit late for that.>>><<<As others have said, everything is. Pico, Meta, Microsoft, Valve, literally anything is a security threat to a high degree. You are actively signing up to share your data, that is how these companies make there money.

They are going to spy on you, whether legal or not.>>><<<&gt; Valve

 But that's just a standard thing for storefronts, and is arguably a good thing>>><<<If you see a Chinese company as more of a threat than an American country, you should really ask yourself who is more able to do something nefarious with your data. What can China do to you? Not a lot. This whole fearmongering about China is just Yellow Peril/Red Scare 2.0. Don't fall for it.>>><<<How blissfully ignorant. You do realize that China's vast grasp over the data of almost the entire US population allows China to track the locations of government employees, build dossiers for blackmail, conduct corporate espionage and even more?>>><<<I agree it is definitely a no-no if you are a government employee. But you got any of that proof that they are actually doing all of that?>>><<<Don't forget any device the Chinese have access to with a mic most likely has recorded ssn, birth date, wedding date, family member names, bank account info...

Voice to text and ai parsing of logs can make a lot of data fit in a relatively small amount of storage space...

It is not just gov officials they track, anyone might run into a person of interest, just think of how 20 people in a coffee shop with the Chinese monitoring their phone mics can pick up a lot of info about people that are harder to track (gov officials).  A cell phone microphone can pick up a crazy amount of background sounds over a pretty long distance.

How many movies have been made where someone does something to someone else and then says "I'm sorry, they made me do it, they were going to hurt..."  blackmail is some serious stuff and can be hard to figure out why something happened later on.

One more... a lot of people speak their passwords out loud (softly), how many gov agency hacks were performed using valid credentials?  You don't need social engineering anymore, just time, patience, and access to someone's phone (or VR headset, or TV).>>><<<You’re thinking about potential (and being incorrect, it’s the internet, you think proximity matters?). But you’re forgetting motive.    
       
North American corporations are exploiting us, but they still care about North American economics and stability (unless they plan to side with China). The CCP would benefit from North American chaos and destabilization. Why would they not encourage that? That’s what it comes down to. It would benefit them if it occurred, they have the power to encourage it, they would thin it is stupid not to, therefore they’re making efforts to destabilize, radicalize, and stupidify North American populations.     
     
Like seriously, we already know they’ve been meddling in our actual governments, our governments have finally admitted to it, and you know they would lie to deny it for as long as they could. We’d have to be pretty stupid to not realize they’re been attempting to meddle with our psychology through our economics as well.>>><<<Given Pico is owned by  a social media company i would fully expect they are scraping usage data of various things and collecting it.  But as you are not a chinese national or resident, does that really matter to you personally?  if it does then don't buy one.

But it very well could be doing almost anything in the background.  The Oculus App is notorious for chewing up CPU cycles even when your VR isnt' turned on... wtf is it doing?!?!  i wonder.   I haven't heard similar reports on PIco's software but the nature of software is that it evolves over time, the answer today doesn't necessarily apply tomorrow.  Computers are never the same tomorrow as they were today unless you keep them in an offline state.>>><<<Personally I wouldn't use any bytedance product, though if you've blocked it from the internet and use virtual desktop to stream your PC then you should be fine.>>><<<I use it for PCVR. Just connect it, launch Pico Link software and then Steam>>><<<Ah, I don't really know if the Pico Link Software has any out bound connections.  It shouldn't need to, but this is the same company that owns TikTok which was found collecting data from other apps on your phone.  I don't really see if anyone has done any research on this but you could probably check if you know how to use Wireshark.>>><<<Well, I have it blocked in firewall so it can't connect to the internet.

I guess I can expect the Google stuff using g an android phone, but how the freak did "offer up" know?>>><<<Your phone is a security threat>>><<<Quest 2 actually weights less than a Rift S (503 grams vs 563 grams), so the issue is that the Quest 2 default strap is absolutely awful and also that the Quest 2 weight is entirely concentrated at the front of the headset. If you buy a halo strap for it (like BoboVR M2 Plus/Pro) you will get an improvement in comfort and ergonomics.

But if you still want to get a new headset, for non standalone other than Bigscreen Beyond I can only think of the Reverb G2. It is very good in terms of visuals and it seems to be comfortable, however it's tracking is a bit finnicky and Windows Mixed Reality will be discontinued starting from 2027, so I don't recommend you get one at this point.

Pimax Crystal that someone recommended is not only pretty expensive but is one of the heaviest headsets available (it weights almost a kilogram). It's main target audience are people who seek the best possible image quality (not comfort).

Maybe a good option for a high-res headset with very good comfort is the Pico 4. It's an all-in-one headset that weights just a bit more than the Rift S (584 grams vs 563 grams) but it is extremely well balanced since (unlike the Quest) it's battery is located at the back of the headset, so it will probably be even more comfortable to wear than a Rift S (Pico 4 weights only 295 grams at the front). Just buy an AMVR face pad for the Pico 4 (default one is a bit hard) and you will have a very comfortable headset for PCVR that has pancake lenses and a resolution similar to a Quest 3. Here is a review of someone who owned a Rift S and got a Pico 4 (it seems he found Pico 4 to be a bit more comfortable to wear than the Rift S): [My opinion of Pico 4 after using Rift S for 3 years : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PicoXR/comments/ys5goj/my_opinion_of_pico_4_after_using_rift_s_for_3/).>>><<<Hi everyone, just wanted to say thank you for all the great suggestions so far! Also for the information that Rift S and Quest 2 are actually similar weights, but it's the head-strap the makes the difference. I'm definitely appreciating the 3rd party head-strap suggestions as well!>>><<<Yea get a head strap for sure. I legit do not understand how anyone even remotely wears a Q2 with the native head strap as it was an instant no for me. I didn’t go bobo I went kiwi,  it the comfort straps that come with a built in battery pack balance the weight nicely>>><<<it's definitely more about weight distribution than just raw weight, the quest 3 is slightly heavier than the quest 2 yet it's way more comfortable. i can highly recommend the bobovr m2 for the quest 2, it's what i used before i upgraded to the quest 3 and it made it very comfortable>>><<<primax crystal - quite expensive but great quality supposedly, pico neo 3 link - cheaper, fresnel but with displayport (has standalone mode also). also pico has bland colors. there's also dpvr e4 but i'd rather get pico tbh

it's sad how few displayport inside out options we have>>><<<Based on OPs post, he's looking for a *light* headset

Unless I'm very wrong - the crystal is notoriously known for being heavy>>><<<Ah right, yeah primax is a helmet >>><<<Big headsets like the valve index (800 grams) or Varjo Aero  (750 grams) are usually very front-heavy.

Pimax Crystal weighs 850 grams but about 1/3 of the weight, the battery is distributed to the back of your head, making it less front heavy and feels lighter due to better weight distribution and balance.

But the Crystal is extremely bulky for its weight.

Fun fact, AVP is heavier than the Crystal if you include the battery. (650 headset + 350 battery)>>><<<Yeah well, when the battery isn't on your head it could weigh 1kg for all I care :)

Weight distribution is very important indeed, but weight is still weight

I use the boboVR S3 which also has a battery in the back, so it balances the Q3 weight, and still, you feel it.

Balanced heavy is better than front heavy, but light is better than both>>><<<Yeah... also "great quality" and Pimax in the same sentence makes me cringe a bit...>>><<<Also terrible build quality. One of my friends has one and whenever we are playing VR together all anyone can hear is his headset creaking.>>><<<Also, Crystal is technically an all-in-one.>>><<<No company named "Primax" makes VR hardware.>>><<<Loool I legit thought it’s primax :D you are right >>><<<The HP Reverb G2. Though I wouldn't get one since it seems to be on life support now.>>><<<I'm interested as well

I own a Q3 and have tried several different comfort kits, but at the end of the day - it's a heavy headset

I would have gotten a Beyond myself, but it requires both base stations and index controllers, not to mention people are saying the sweet spot is small so you have to move your head instead of eyes, which I cannot go back to using my Q3

I hope we'll get some in the next couple of years, but I wouldnt hold my breath>>><<<The beyonds sweet spot is dependent on cushion depth. But you basically need your eye lashes to touch to fully get the max fov and best possible edge to edge clarity. If they made a headset that was even over double the weight with Q3 fov and and edge to edge clarity I'd buy it in a heart beat, but the small form factor limits that. Of you're doing room scale things it's a bit easier to overcome, anything seated, it's a bit more noticable that you're constantly moving your head.>>><<<Ahhh exactly

It is so sad that there isn't a pcvr headset without compromise. 

I wish there was a headset that has everything, and the only downside is being expensive

The Beyond really went as light as possible, but the hit you take for clarity and fov IMO is not worth the compromise

It is as you say - if there was a headset slightly heavier than the beyond with better fov and clarity, it was my first choice too>>><<<That's where the tech is unfortunately. Nothing can be done without compromise The quest 3 sort of feels like the absolute compromise headset. With the exception of it's lenses everything about it is mediocre to okay(comfort for anyone with a wide head is atrocious though).

I had a beyond, but the small size meant very short perceived focal distance with gave me eye strain, it made the other shortcomings a bit too much to bare for me personally. 

If someone made a headset with 2500-3000 pixel OLED displays, with index/Q3 FOV and the Edge to edge clarity of a Q3, audio from a valve index, in a package that weighed in the ballpark of a Q3 or index, I'd be happy to shell out a lot of money. Wireless would be a nice bonus but not a requirement.>>><<<Well, that's basically the mythological Deckard

Too bad it's only rumors so far>>><<<I'm pretty much in the same boat and there's just fucking nothing. I'd get the Crystal if it wasn't like 1.2kg. Supposedly DPVR are working on a high end headset so there's a sliver of hope there. 

I guess if you're on windows 10 and don't need to upgrade to 11 any time soon and you're fine with very subpar tracking you could just get a used G2. It's super comfortable and the image quality is great.>>><<<DPVR E4 ?>>><<<The Immersed Visor should be coming out this year. Weighs about 200g, has 4k (per eye) screens with passthrough, inside out tracking, and wired/wireless capability.

According to their CEO, demos should be happening in Q2 of this year.>>><<<&gt; Rift S back, and I figured I'd give it a spin. I was instantly amazed by how much lighter it was compared to the Quest 2 

Something's weird in this story:

Rift S weight with headstrap: 590 g

Quest 2 weight with headstrap: 503 g

Just get a better headstrap (bobovr?) for better comfort and weight distribution. 

Or use this website https://vr-compare.com to find a headset that will suit your needs.>>><<<Based on other replies I've seen, I think that it may really be the head-strap. Thank you for the link as well, it looks like a great resource!>>><<<I can recommend the kiwi design head strap. I have the one with battery so substantially heavier than a vanilla quest 3,but so much more comfortable and more than 4 hours of playtime. Bobo-vr headstrap does seem a little more "solid", but I got my headstrap with battery for less than the bobo-vr headstrap without battery.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Fair point, but there's no doubt that the Rift S hardware is much lighter for not having to actually generate graphics the way that a Quest 2 does. Mostly I'm looking for a light headset, and having a full processor inside of it makes something heavier.>>><<<What ?>>><<<Just get a Quest 3... who cares if it can function as a standalone device? It does wireless PCVR very well.

I think not needing base stations implies inside-out tracking, which kind of requires the hardware that comes with a standalone headset.>>><<<Pimax Crystal does not require base stations, but is wired.>>><<<And is extremely heavy. It's not what OP is looking for, I think.>>><<<The only headset with trackers around the room is the Oculus CV1.

You seem to want a headset with lighthouses, also known as base stations, since you don't want a headset that can track itself.>>><<<Read the title again>>><<<The Rift S is still over 500 grams, similar in weight to the Quest. So it’s probably the weight distribution of it sitting on your head that gives the illusion that it’s a lot lighter but really it’s negligible. How the strap distributes the weight across your head is the important part here. 

There are many third party strap options for the Quest that will help with that.>>><<<The Quest 2's issue is mostly weight distribution instead of the actual weight. I'd probably try a used Quest Pro or Pico 4 instead since they have better weight distribution. You can also try a Quest 2/3 with a third-party headstrap.

Not much else really, the XR4 is absurdly expensive and doesn't work well with VR games and the Crystal is 1Kg>>><<<I should add that all two Quest 2's we have in my house and my Quest 3 are all being used with BoboVR halo straps and batteries. It's very comfy and well balanced. I don't even notice the weight. I don't even wear it with the facial interface on so my face can breath.>>><<<I got the Pimax Crystal on sale from Amazon for $1223 (US) bout 3 weeks ago which was a steal I thought. It's been my daily ride. I still have a Quest but for PCVR my Pimax Crystal is always my go to. I'm not going to list all the pros because it blows away headsets that I've used (I have used Rift/Quest2/3). The main one though is the display port and my USB3.2 port keeps my battery 100% charged after hrs of use (granted, quest headset always fully charged too). Displayport means I am getting uncompressed video. No fussing bout with encoding/decoding and bit rate settings in Oculus tools etc.

One sweet thing though I didnt think bout- it has a switch where you can choose between standalone and PCVR mode. I missed this so much from the Rift. I always hated that BS with the Quest where it starts in standlone. It annoys me greatly and I missed that feature from the Rift so much. It feels so good to have a PCVR dedicated headset I cannot stress how great it is to be free of Quest Link

But if you not willing to step up to this price I get- just grab a Quest 3 its a great headset for the price.

The weight is fine after hrs of use but yes- when I put on my Quest headset I cant lie I am amazed how much lighter it feels.

If you want PCVR go with Pimax Crystal it's just not close whatsoever. 4k per eye, dynamic foveated rendering, 200 nits, light dimming, etc. But if you do not have a mid range PC just go Quest 3 for standalone / CitraVR etc

Also I always play wired. If you want to play wireless I do not think Pimax Crystal has that yet. Also we lack passthrough atm. Something to think bout.>>><<<I got an aftermarket strap with rear battery in my old Q2 and although it added weight to the headset it was balanced better and more comfortable.>>><<<The HP Reverb G2 is really good in terms of resolution, and is inside-out tracked, but WMR is officially deprecated so the future of the headset is up in the air and it's not looking good.>>><<<If you are happy using Windows 10, don't care about upgrading to Windows 11, and are fine replacing the headset in a couple years, the HP Reverb G2 is probably the best bet if you can pick one up for cheap. 

The main downsides to the G2 is the controller tracking is slightly worse than the Quest2 and Windows Mixed Reality platform is not as popular as Vive/Index/Oculus and therefore not as well supported by software.  If your main usage is simracing or similar the G2 works great.  

If you just want more resolution, you could also get a Quest 3 with a nice headstrap.>>><<<Hey guys is index worth buying in 2023>>><<<Kinda sorta. The base stations and controllers are good. I'd recommend them with the BSB if you can afford it>>><<<Ok that was a joke lol, but thanks for the answer. I've had index since launch and got q3 a couple months ago. There's a way to make knuckles work with q3 using index as a dongle, but I didn't have enough time for it and q3 controllers aren't that bad>>><<<I think my next quest upgrade will be pro controllers>>><<<ya Backstreet Boys put on a good show>>><<<Used for the right price, yes. New, no.>>><<<Its 2024>>><<<it's 2017>>><<<I picked a complete index kit second hand from ebay last week for £540 - only used for 10 hours and looks brand new. I wouldn't buy one full price though.>>><<<Headset itself, not at all. The base stations and controllers are if you want to pair them with a Crystal, BSB, the upcoming Somnium, and maybe AVP, seems like some have got that to work now.>>><<<Only if it had pancakes yummy lmao>>><<<Nothing else comes close in terms of audio quality, especially without headphones touching your ears. There's also no other headsets that can do 144Hz, which is a very noticeable upgrade over 120Hz in fast paced games or if you're moving your head around a lot. It's also got a larger fov than any other headset on the market right now.

Basically, if you care more about peak pixel density and resolution, then get a bigscreen beyond with index controllers and lighthouses. If you care more about smoothness, audio quality, and immersiveness, get an Index full kit. It's been out for a few years now, so you can get used kits for a decent price if you don't mind potentially having to clean someone else's face gunk off of it.>>><<<&gt;Nothing else comes close in terms of audio quality, especially without headphones touching your ears. 

Yes. BMR drives which you can literally buy for $15 and plug into the headphone port of the quest>>><<<Me and my CV1 skating by unharmed B)>>><<<A few friends of mine bought CV1s for €50-€80 used to play Alyx. I don't think you can compete with that level of bang for buck.>>><<<Going from CV1 to an index was a huge letdown for me, still using it instead to this day. Wish there was a headset like it in terms of weight and controllers while having more fov and pixels, would tick all the boxes for me.>>><<<Literally the Quest 3 of you don't care too much for the OLED displays. Very similar controllers, higher FOV, more pixels, better edge to edge clarity, no god rays.

Downsides: It's heavier 470g (CV1 without cable) vs 660g (Quest 3 with elite style headstrap), no perfect blacks and controller tracking might be worse, depending on how many sensors you used on the CV1.

Now, the additional 190g don't feel like it because it's closer to your face and there's no cable tugging on the headset, the controller tracking can be just plain better than CV1 if you go for the Pro Controllers and the blacks... Yeah, you can't do anything there.>>><<<Oh man yeah! An updated cv1 (cv2?) would've been bonkers. The HP Reverb G2 was a good try but missing the oled and the controllers were shite.>>><<<Me missing my DK1 and DK2 that I stupidly sold.>>><<<I miss my CV1 man>>><<<You forgot all of us WMR mofos getting dropped by Microsoft in about two years. 

Hopefully BSB 2.0 will release by then though with some further QOL updates 👀

Edit: guys, call me coping but Microsoft clearly states that by not updating to the new update slated this year we can use WMR headsets until 11/06/26–about two years from now—and 11/06/27 if you are on Windows 11 Enterprise or other commercial version of the OS.>>><<<There was an announcement from Microsoft that they remove support in Windows 11 24H2 update and recommend staying on 23H2 and installing only security updates if you want to still use WMR headset. I'm still staying on Windows 10 - way less hassle with VR.>>><<<bsb?

I've got a HP Reverb that I have attached to my media center, I'd like to see it remain usable, but .. also, if there's no support, will it really remain usable for much longer anyway?>>><<<Exactly what i was going to say :(

WMR on Linux looks promising at least. They only need to figure out the controller tracking>>><<<&gt;only>>><<<Only controller tracking? From what I see, Monado supports experimental 6DoF tracking (for the headset), but only with external systems (I imagine that means outside in), is that right? So inside out seems to be another thing it doesn’t support yet.>>><<<Idk I saw this. I’m not an expert so i may just not understand it properly

https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/s/oor4LxIsV5>>><<<No, it supports camera-based inside out tracking for the WMR headsets and Rift S (but no persistent play-spaces yet, and it's not as good as the tracking on Windows right now). Controllers are only 3dof right now, but there's also very very flaky hand tracking.

  
The Monado homepage means "external" by it's just a second piece of software that does it (Monado's fork of Basalt), I guess there's some implication from that there was some intention to merge the SLAM tracking into Monado itself eventually, but it doesn't seem like that's still the plan from what I gather. I'm not a developer on the project, I just use it and lurk in their Discord. :p>>><<<&gt;WMR mofos getting dropped by Microsoft in about two years.

Actually they already dropped it.>>><<<Two years from when they bought it, not two years from today.

The HP Reverb G2 launched in late 2020, Microsoft laid off the WMR dev teams in early 2023, so a little over two years.>>><<<Pico 4 user been happy with their headset because everything is balanced as thing should be>>><<<Pico 4 is legit for the price>>><<<Ui/ux and the “store”>>><<<Who tf uses standalone on it? It's mainly a pcvr base for modding>>><<<The answer to your question is, I’m sure somebody.>>><<<Exactly. You're buying something and not even using half its function.>>><<<Why should i use standalone when it's better on pc? And my hardware mods don't work on standalone>>><<<Well if you don't wanna lug your PC around if you travel. Granted pico probably doesn't have the standalone support either that quest does, but I tried my buddies quest 3 recently after being strictly PCVR and it's a game changer. Especially the exclusives I've been missing out on.>>><<<Damn, no Rift S meme?>>><<<As a rift s owner I feel ya, even the meme forgot about me lol>>><<<I bought one in 2020 literally a couple months before they stopped supporting the oculus store on it>>><<<I still have my headset and controllers. Sold the cable for like $100 two years ago.>>><<<Are we missing out? on what?, steam has all the vr games and the up to date GPU handles everything...>>><<<I mainly just want better resolution tbh. Screen door effect with the Rift S can be annoying. Plus the passthrough isn't that good>>><<<Cue picture of a child playing with a SNES in 2024>>><<<Something like "Rift S users begging for support less than 3 years after release".  Rift S was a good headset for $400 but the speed which they dropped support for it is criminal.>>><<<OP doesn't know what a rift S is, they're new to vr>>><<<OP couldn’t hear the Rift S users through the robotic screeching coming from their mics.

I didn’t buy the headset, only the controllers and I used them with the vive for soooo long before getting a quest 2. I still use my quest 2 and wish I could use them with it.

I had to repair one of the jacks on my headset *just* after the support window ended; they wanted something like $200, so I did it myself instead. There were a ton of other horror stories about their support. Their own software was supposed to make it possible to see your Android phone notifications within VR, which would have been really useful except it never even kinda worked, and the software instead tended to make SteamVR unusable.


The Vive was a pretty good headset, and the fact that it came with controllers straight away was a huge plus. (CV1 originally released *without* controllers, and only came with an XBox controller in the box, along with Oculus insisting "Rift is a seated experience." It was a bizarre time.) Lighthouse tracking was also unbeatable for years. But yeah, I don't care that there isn't another good HTC headset. I haven't upgraded because, on the one hand, it's very expensive to do so, and on the other hand, what you can do with the headset is still pretty limited. If Deckard ever comes out I'll upgrade, though.>>><<<Same here. A lot of the current VR systems would be an upgrade from my original Vive, but they're not big enough to justify the cost. But I'd love something as innovative with base stations and controls with a great screen (bonus points if it's a Valve product).>>><<<I'm not that set on the lighthouses anymore. Inside-out has come a LONG way, which is to be expected after eight years! Early on, other tracking systems rsiked nausea (looking at you, PSVR1), but I think that's mostly a thing of the past at this point. And I put up the lighthouses in my office, which is often too filled with my various projects to easily clear for VR use. So I'd probably actually use a headset more if it didn't rely on base stations. The "not enough of an upgrade" thing is definitely a big part of it, though. The GPU market being awful for many years didn't help thing either. I *finally* upgraded from my 970 last year to a used 3070 for about $280 (edit: it wasn't $200, it was about $280), and I wasn't confident my 970 could drive the higher resolutions and framerates of an upgraded headset. That's a lot of why I never went to the Index. At this point I would kind of consider the Quest 3, but I can't get over my distaste for Meta. Thus the interest in Deckard.>>><<<"I hate everyone equally" energy>>><<<He likes Bigscreen Beyond, tho.>>><<<I like every headset i mentioned tbh

Having using it since lauch, I can find it in like, less than 10 sec.

There's a pretty much 30% chance that it just decides it doesn't want to connect to the PC.

I'll let the dust settle until next generation, or possibly the one after that.>>><<<I just got my quest 2 used. I'll wait til the 3 or pro or whatever reaches a price I want to pay. I'm very happy with the quest 2. Sure he 3 and avp is better but whatever.>>><<<I got Quest 2 new and it still delivers what I want for 3D gaming on stand alone or PC. I'd recommend splurging for Quest 3 over 2, but 2 still does all I need to have fun.>>><<<Yeah, having used both a lot recently, the only appreciable reason to upgrade is for the lens clarity.  Every other improvement feels incremental, but the lenses are a generational improvement, IMO.

Passthrough is nice, but more like a perk than a feature.  There are only a handful of worthwhile games that use the color passthrough to really improve the game.  Most just make a gimmick out of it.  Stuff like Eleven Table Tennis actually use it amazingly, allowing you to be sure you're not about to lunge into a piece or furniture or something going for a tricky shot.

Best VR controllers I've ever used. I like them more than the Index Knuckles controllers.>>><<<I’m running a Vive Pro off a 1080. You do not need a 4090>>><<<I thought the special encoding feature for VD was exclusive to the 4090.

AV1 codec?  It's not locked behind the 4090.  I have a 4080 and use it.  It's only decodable by the Quest 3 though, maybe that's what you're thinking of?

The only thing that requires a 4090 is the "Godlike" quality setting, which is the highest level of resolution (~3.1K per eye).  Ultra is ~2.7k per eye, so the diminishing returns are real, but if you happen to have a 4090 that can push that resolution in AAA games, you might as well use Godlike.>>><<<Me as a Beat Saber user.

It's funny how they try to force so much hype for PS hardware and then pass without fame or glory.>>><<<i dont own a psvr2 what is "the sweet spot">>><<<The lenses require you to have them perfectly lined up with your pupils, otherwise everything is blurry.  If you are perfectly lined up with the sweet spot, then the center is clear and the blur only creeps in from the edges, like Quest 1/2.  But the PSVR2 is notorious for having a really small sweet spot.  I used one for a day or so, and it was pretty annoying compared to headsets with pancake lenses, like Quest 3.>>><<<I still haven't found a good reason to upgrade from my cv1, new devices just don't seem like a good enough upgrade for me.>>><<<similar for me

The first two things you mentioned are likely to come very soon. I'm not sure how insane of a breakthrough you realize the other thing would be. VR is small potatoes compared to the applications of a consumer product making people feel certain ways just through stimulating nerves. That kind of tech is at least 10 years away.>>><<<The very near future is a rather subjective measure, you are absolutely right. I should have said "optimistically within the next ten years">>><<<Well the other two I can see happening pretty soon (though there are some arguments about limits in wireless bandwidth).>>><<<Well if someone tried something twenty years ago and it sucked, it will always suck. Especially when it comes to technology, nothing ever gets better. >>><<<If it makes you feel any better, some developers try to use haptics right now in the Vive to make it feel realistic with the controllers vibrating when you hit a ping pong ball or shoot with a pool cue. Doesn't feel immersive at all to me. They just need to give up on gimmicky vibrations. It's a bad idea, not immature tech.>>><<<I agree it's not brilliant, but I think it's better than nothing. For example in audioshield, I would miss the vibration when I connect with an orb. And some developers do it better than others. Have you seen the Tactical Haptics prototypes? Weighted feedback giving a much more realistic impression than just vibration. I don't think giving up is the answer, it just needs to improve. >>><<<I think we're 8-10 years off on the headsets alone (no visible pixels, full FOV...etc).  Not sure about the haptics, or even if there's a big enough market for it.>>><<<This headset needs to be combined with this hand tracker:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6vua-b0Qo

Fine hand control in a videogame is soooooo desirable!>>><<<wow!>>><<<*Merged* reality? That is so 2016. 

Maximized reality is where it's at now!>>><<<No!  [Hyperreality!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality)

Warning: Philosophy stuff.>>><<<Well thanks for leading me down a rabbit hole to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) lovely but incredibly time wasting article! :P>>><<<If this ends up sub $1000 I'd buy it>>><<<I have a feeling that it's specs are not going to be up to par to drive anything at an even remotely high fidelity. Since it's all in one heat, battery, and power will all be a big issues. Probably will end up being a glorified youtube 360 video player like most smartphone VR sets are.>>><<<This is why I think smartphones in portable headsets are way better. People are already upgrading their $700-1k smartphones every year, might as well put them to use. I can't see there being a huge market for people dumping that much cash on a dedicated mobile unit (unless it's significantly more powerful).

Good to see a bunch of players in the game though, all VR is starved for content, at least PSVR looks to get out of the gates with a lot to offer.
>>><<<Yup, it's got the same issues as any portable computer.  Depends on your definition of fidelity.  You can drive high resolutions and frame rates without huge computational power if you're willing to relax on realism.  And that's a perfectly fair trade-off here.  Nobody's assuming photorealism in the first few generations.>>><<<What we need is wireless VR rendered on a regular computer, with low latency (i.e. a high bandwidth channel, not some overly fancy compression schemes over wifi), not so much another Gear VR but from Intel and you can't use it as a phone (and it comes out years late at the point where Gear VR surpasses it). Transmitting video over infrared or 60ghz radio or something of that kind.>>><<<I don't think we'll see anything like that for a while.  60ghz Wifi has the potential to be quite fast, but not nearly fast enough.  Heavy compression will still be necessary, especially when you consider future headsets with a higher resolution.

I think that a decent compromise will have to be met.  You're going to have to have a cable connected to the headset, no doubt.  However, what that *means* could change.

I agree that putting all the hardware in the headset is just silly.  I don't see any reason why you couldn't put more of that hardware inside another portable device, though.>>><<<A couple GHz bandwidth at 60GHz would be more than enough for with rudimentary compression. 2 megapixels entirely uncompressed at 90 frames per second and 24 bits per pixel is only 4.3 gigabits of bandwidth, which can be brought down several times with simple compression schemes (that don't add latency). Really the ip data over WIFI is just a wrong approach here, what it needs is more like old time TV which transmitted an entirely uncompressed signal, but with modern advances like simple compression methods used on-GPU for textures.>>><<<For a 1080p headset, sure.  Unfortunately, any headsets developed after technology like 60Ghz radio technology becomes commonplace will likely have a much higher resolution.  Current estimates for 60Ghz transmissions put you at about 7Gbit/s.  That's not going to push a 4k signal at 90hz.

It's possible with clever compression techniques, but I worry about compression artifacts.  While not bad, they'll be noticeable, and you'll always get a better experience with a raw signal over a cable.>>><<<This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/16/intel-announces-project-alloy-an-all-in-one-vr-headset/) reduced by 58%.

&gt; &amp;quot;Anyone can take Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class VR system,&amp;quot; Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said.

&gt; In a brief demo at IDF, an Intel rep wearing a Project Alloy headset was able to wander around the stage, while at the same time navigating a virtual room.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s an important step for the future of VR and AR. As great as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are, they&amp;#039;re both severely limited by all of the wires required to connect them to PCs. We already have a glimpse at wireless virtual reality with the Gear VR, but it looks like Intel is going to push things even further with Alloy.

I do like the distance-limited representation of real-world objects. >>><<<So this is the first example we've seen of actual merged reality. Is that what we're calling it now? HoloLens / Magic Leap for example, are AR devices only.>>><<<Not really. AMDs Sulon VR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp90zGjydwI>>><<<Why do you say this?  HoloLens can already scan the room you're in, allow you to walk between rooms, and track your hand gestures.>>><<<Because mixed / merged reality is a mix of both AR and VR. HoloLens has no VR capabilities. Not knocking on HoloLens though, it's really amazing. But it's not mixed reality.>>><<<Ah, so opacity is the technical sticking point here?>>><<<dont forget that with the Hololens nothing comes between your eyes and the holograms projected. Not even hands (which is a huge bummer).>>><<<I was waiting for Google to do a similar thing using Tango... wow!
Would be interesting too evaluate the processing power, battery duration and this kind of specs... but the premises are really awesome!>>><<<Just hoping it won't be as expensive as the Oculus or the Vive. Not regretting my purchase at all, just not willing to spend a high amount another time. I've done it this time, but I won't the next time.>>><<<2160x2160 puts it on par with reverb g2

I'm surprised it can stream that over wifi honestly>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<It hit streams a compressed image, which is quite noticeable ingame. Thst being said it's apparently better than the quest 2, and mrtv has shown a pretty neat through the lense video of half life: Alyx. It might be worth a shot>>><<<I found out about Pico 4 being released in China last week and talked to my friend who's in Shanghai about it. He then found a Pico shop in Shanghai and went over to try it out.  
He said the headset feels much lighter in weight than the Quest 2, and he said the images look much nicer.

As both of us have been Quest 2 users, but we are both getting tired of the weight and uncomfort of Quest 2, we were looking forward to the Quest pro. Then we found out about Pico 4, which I had no knowledge about the Pico headsets until now.

And since I need to get a new headset for work, so I decided to go on Taobao and got one and  get it shipped to HK (which is not one of the launch locations)

I've heard that the Chinese version requires China ID to purchase software from the Pico store.  So I asked him to ask the store clerk for some information.

Here is what he found out:  
\- Support steam VR  
\- Need a China ID (Which I do not have)  
\- HK and Taiwan cannot work (😬 We will see about that, even if it works with PCVR I'm happy)  
\- It’s 2449rmb for the 128GB one

I think I will get the headset sometime tomorrow.  I'll see maybe I'll give it a review here once I try it out after I get it.>>><<<How'd you go?>>><<<It's good, I have another thread about my experience with the Pico 4.  You can check it out>>><<<&gt;The Best VR Gaming Headset?

Not without DP it isn't.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yes it is. I have one and I have shown repeatedly how good it is on the forums of the games I play and the flight sims I use. Brilliant with Virtual Desktop wireless.

Do You have one? I doubt it - else you wouldn't say these absurd things that just aren't true. Not unless you had another agenda. That seems to be a common thing - people telling us "How It Is" without even experiencing it.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<DP as in Dick Picks?>>><<<Is this also the case for Pico 4 Pro?>>><<<Yes.>>><<<Well fuck>>><<<Another HMD with minimum IPD of 62mm. Why.

My Index goes down to 58mm.>>><<<Pico 4 goes down to 58mm.  There's just a warning under 62mm that it may be uncomfortable for some.>>><<<That is because the hardware only goes down to 62, but the software goes down to 58.>>><<<ah! Good to know, I might actually have to give one a try. I know the pico 3 has the version with pc connection, think the pico 4 will later have a version with DP or whatever?>>><<<I couldn't say.  It would follow their historical trend, but they are under new management after the ByteDance acquisition, and they seem to be putting more energy into standalone VR this generation.

Honestly unless the wire is killing you, you're probably better off with the Index for now.>>><<<It can’t beat Vive Pro 2 wireless so no.>>><<<Comparing a €429 headset to a ±€2000 vr setup is not really a fair comparison though>>><<<VP2 wireless has zero compression or latency. I love it.>>><<<I know right!  I’m getting downvotes for truth….. 😀👌>>><<<I've used wireless on OG since years ago, I then upgraded to VP2 and used the adapter kit to fit it to the VP2.

Also fun to read how PlayStation VR2 launch will supercharge games - hope that happens too.>>><<<Gotcha. I seen that, I thought something was actually announced or on the horizon. We will see>>><<<I dunno I went back to cable on cosmos elite because wireless adapter couldn't keep up with super sampling. 5800x 3080 32gb ram.  It's was better than q2 vd  for sure in latency but not heads above in image quality. I dunno maybe I had a dud.>>><<<Possibly, also it hammers cpu and graphics power.>>><<<I doubt you have a dud, as the other person said it’s tough on cpus. However I will say my performance increased noticeably when I ordered one of those custom 3D printed fan mounts from ebay. I think it does have a thermal throttling problem as well. I would recommend looking into it it you ever want to give it a second try, it was pretty inexpensive too.>>><<<Sure wish I had an extra pci-e slot =(>>><<<I have the Vive Pro wireless. 

Love the OLED screen and the wifi quality obviously. 

But I basically never touch it because it's sooo bulky. And the lenses are very bad, blurry everywhere apart from the centre.  I just play quest 2 and Pimax 8kx for pcvr.  

So I'm getting a Pico 4 for it being allegedly much lighter, better lenses, better res.  Yes so WiFi virtual desktop will be worse quality for sure, but I'm going to see if it's a trade-off I can tolerate.>>><<<I don’t understand what this has to do with my post?  I said VP 2.>>><<<Yeh I only have VP 1, is VP2 other than res that much better?

Is it *significantly* lighter and less bulky than VP1 and the wireless thing and the battery you have to put on your belt?  

Are the awful lenses (the worst I have ever come across, having owned almost everything else) totally different and significantly better than the VP1? 

If it's a *completely* different beast maybe I'll look into it. I'm genuinely interested. 

Oh it is different in one major way actually - it now no longer has the benefit of OLED 😁

But yeh I'd love to know how much better VP2 is for sure and I'll maybe cancel the Pico>>><<<If this had Beat Saber it'd be a no brainer for me. If this had a displayport it'd also be a no brainer. Now I'm waiting for the upcoming "business" quest pro headset zuck played fencing on to see if that got a display port.>>><<<No beatsaber puts me off.  But it's such a graphically simple game I don't think using virtual desktop from a pc would be a problem (assuming you have a pc).>>><<<correct me if im wrong, the quest pro isnt supposed to be a gaming headset right? ive seen rumors saying it is just an AR buisness headset and not a headset where u can play beatsaber>>><<<It would be under the facial interface>>><<<It Totally would, god, i know they're going to fuck up VR somehow...

I hope they don't... But I just have this feeling>>><<<They cant fuck up something they invented, silly you>>><<<Damn you right, I can't wait for them to invent hand tracking, and then the masses will say it's "good enough" and devs will start to ignore the controller, setting back VR games by 5 years.

The apple way.>>><<<The chances of that happening would have been higher if the quest 2 didn't exist>>><<<The problem ther is, let's say quest 2 has sold 10 million units.... That's a rounding error on the ammount of products that apple is pushing for.

If they're entering the market, it's because they think they can make it main stream, they're looking for 500 million, which if that's 500 million vr headsets with no tracked controllers, devs might push for that type of play.

Do I think it will actually happen? Probably not.

But the idea it *could* is kinda the worry

Edit: or apple is going extremely niche, which is more likely, due to the rumoured price.

I won't actually be worried about them doing anything stupid to upset the normal VR *Gaming* industry for a while.>>><<<Since the price is steep they are probably going for the enterprise market but the HTC enterprise headsets are cheeper and use steamvr tracking so it's easier to develop>>><<<It's not only rumoured that the price is extremely step, but also that they will be making very few of them.>>><<<AKA the Blackberry of VR.>>><<<i confidently expect the entire headset frame to be made of tempered glass with gorgeous bevels. the controllers will be made of diamonds so that if you the touch the headset with the controllers it will explode instantaneously>>><<<Literal "diamond hands", quite meme-able at least.>>><<<Omg they're totally gonna make it easy to break aren't they? So that we would have to spend even more money on repairs>>><<<Never mind the wire. Whoever's wearing this has prey eyes.>>><<<If we were in a more mainstream subreddit and not a tech-savvy one like r/VirtualReality you'd be getting downvotebombed by any Apple fan smart enough to understand what you said (and probably also by those who didn't understand)>>><<<I just realised the implication, lol.

Honestly, I don't like Apple all that much, but this might as well be true.

I owned loads of "smart" devices prior to the iPhone; XDA's, PDA's, Psion devices, various "smart" Nokias... Crap. All of them. Useless. They were made by phone designers and they needed a computer maker to come along and obliterate the market.

I dislike Apple but I respect what they did with the iPhone, because if devices still worked like PDAs and Smartphones from the mid-00s, you'd be paying by the minute to call someone via WhatsApp on Wifi.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I still ha e many problems switching between 2 densities on osx.>>><<<Part of the reason most Windows apps suck at scaling is because the developers didn't care or it was written before DPI was variable (like XP era).

The Xtal hmd and other HMD's of that level allready offer eye tracked and foveated rendering, 8k screens, and 180 degree vision.     
I tried one on 2 years ago.   
That same year I also tried the pimax eye tracking add on. Buggy but was getting there.

There is *nothing* new about the apple hmd specs that we know so far.

It's going to be good because Apple is good at the things that matter a lot for VR.  
A light and ergonomic design that's going to feel comfortable for almost everyone, low barrier of use, reasonable curration of the eco system,>>><<<&gt; 8k screens

Actually the xtal hmd had two 4k screens. That's nowhere close to the 8k resolution. Two 8k screens have four times more pixels.>>><<<Only we don't know anything about apples screen other then "8k" yet  
it could be one 8k panel for both eyes. 1 panel is easier to work with manufacture wise, easier to guarantee total parity between teh eyes, lower power consumption, less heat generation.      
We don't know they'll have 2 screens or 1 screen.   
Yesterday I saw someone comparing HMD resolutions to 8 texture resolution and saying that was going to be apples resolution.      
We just don't know yet.

And even if, then 8k screens still is not "reinventing"  
It's literally just installing the next expected step in display quality.  zero innovation.  
All hmd makers are going to do it>>><<<Sure, we've only heard about "8k screens" in the apple hmd, but that's not the point. The point is: you haven't tried xtal hmd with "8k screens" because it only had two 4k screens. 8k == 4*4k.>>><<<oh, sorry.  I managed to miss your point. My bad.>>><<<#I no longer allow Reddit to profit from my content - Mass exodus 2023 -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/>>><<<They haven't created any new technology other than inconveniently different data/charging ports.  Everything else is just an iteration on existing technology.

They also have some of the best marketing ever.>>><<<I’ve found that with Apple, the whole is often more than the sum of its parts. They are very good at bringing technology – novel or otherwise – together in a way that works in a cohesive package.

They’re not perfect, but they serve a design-obsessed niche that is not served well by the companies Apple competes with.>>><<<#I no longer allow Reddit to profit from my content - Mass exodus 2023 -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/>>><<<they, like most big companies, don't create new technology, they buy it! ;)>>><<<No usually they take existing technology and improve on it and then patent that. They've actually invented very little. A few years ago I remember a video that went through all of Apples inventions and they found at the time Apple hadnt actually invented anything, just either improved on something already there or mixed two things together. 

Not that this isn't also a good thing, improvements on pre existing technology us very good, saying they invent things is disingenuous>>><<<By your logic, the lightbulb wasn’t an invention since it just mixed together the already invented wire filament and vacuum chamber.
All inventions are iterations on existing technologies to some degree.>>><<<I should have been more specific. Their "inventions" aren't like taking two bits of technology and making something revolutionary like the lightbulb. 

Their "inventions" are pretty much the same as the original thing but with a bit of improvement and usually some first party stuff that means they can charge you for stuff like cables from them.>>><<<[This article](https://medium.com/macoclock/why-apple-is-an-innovative-company-but-not-an-inventive-one-9a9194c571e8) tries to go into this a bit, making a differentiation between invention and innovation.>>><<<&gt; improved on something already there or mixed two things together

That's what invention is. No part of the definition of the word requires that any or all parts of the invention are novel. If they are novel then what you're doing is science.

And they do that too btw.>>><<<Samsung takes risks? Since when?

Samsung milks the people by pushing old tech with a new fancy marketing and one gimmick, and then abandon it as soon they can.

Samsung is like Apple, just worse.>>><<<Folding screens are hella risky.>>><<<Nope, you can call them as user caused damages if broken.
And anyways they get broken, and you sell new phone again...>>><<<Selling something that could destroy itself through normal use is absolutely risky; it could devastate their brand name. This is why the galaxy fold was recalled after review  units were sent out.>>><<<No it isn't, Apple has done that with their laptops for the past decade, their watches for the past five years, and several of their phone releases for the past decade yet people still think they are a "quality brand">>><<<Of course it is risky, but you do not understand now.
Engineers are taught and ordered to design products that fits to specifications. The specifications are done for the product lifetime expectation. Example electronics are given X hours of lifetime, for at given electronic capacities (voltage etc).
And engineers choose components that will fit the specifications, nothing more. Everything is built for the specs.
And when the specs expected lifetime or usage changes, device lifetime is lower.

Samsung as anyone knows that mechanical display tilting is bad. It is regardless done for a lot of devices as such mechanic is required. Be it a door hinge at home, closet or car. Be it a mechanical hinge for laptop display or for a smartphone, it doesn't matter. They are designed to have X count of movement and that is it.

Nokia designed Micro-USB connector, one of the worst there is. By purposely to go broken so new cables and new phones are sold.
Apple got idea to glue a battery to smartphones so they can sell a new one. Tradition that has been carried to laptops and tablets. 

Devices are made more difficult to repair and serviced, so much that you can't even touch your own machine without losing warranty, and even worse - any official repair service and parts purchase.

The whole point is to sell you a new stuff that you don't really need. Like the machine that has a flexible display so you don't have a split between displays? Really, that is what people need?

If you really believe that the some kids mentality "reviewers" was reason to cancel the phone because they got broken in few days in their use, then you seriously downplay all engineers and testing methods in the industry....

You do not seem to know that these companies has own testers, human and machines.
But you believe that samsung didn't test at all those devices to find out those problems, but went to send them to public straight from the design phase without any testing....

When a phone is designed to have a battery that has charging cycles of 500, it last 18-24 months of normal use. When you make a display that withstand 1000-1500 opening or closing actions, it will come in days through when you have a kid playing around with the new toy.

"There is no bad publicity...." (There is, but it is not the point) 

Samsung got more time in media, and when they got a working model, everyone remembers samsung and how things are fixed....

Problems comes when some engineers are not listen. But money and schedule goes first. That is when Discovery shuttle happens.>>><<<&gt;Samsung does that so no need for Apple to risk seeing what works and what doesn't.

It's a shame you are such a fanboy you can't see that Samsung and Apple are essentially the same company with a different name. 

Samsung: OLED is gaining popularity, quick we need to confuse the public, lets call our LED technology, QLED!

Samsung for the past 6 months: LOL Apple so dumb removing the charger from the new iPhone. 

Also Samsung: We are removing the charger from our Galaxy S21 to reduce e-waste.

Don't get me started on how shitty Samsung appliances are.

\- Make worst-designed laptops on the market, heating problems, parts failing constantly, also make it the most expensive laptop on the market aside from uber-enthusiast gaming laptops and make the warranty completely useless unless you pay an extra $200 for AppleCare which still gives you a worse warranty than other premium brands

I'm surprised to see that this isn't everybody. Competition is healthy for any industry. The only people that are against it are apple haters. I'm not even a big fan of apple and I see nothing but positives here. More players in the VR game means more possible advancements.>>><<<I'm all for Apple in VR, but they really need to be complaint with OpenXR standards. And they need to play friendly with non Apple Ecosystem products. Do I suspect PC Support? Hell no, but stuff like FBT, treadmills, and just other stuff you can use to extend VR should be compatible>>><<<This is apple. They already ditched khronos' other big standards opengl and vulkan and did their own thing with metal instead. They won't be touching openxr, their VR will be more proprietary incompatible stuff with the goal to drive people into their walled garden appstore.>>><<<That sounds more like AR than VR>>><<<Seeing nothing but positives? They're another company that heavily pushes a walled-garden exclusive approach. Not exactly "great for everyone" lol>>><<<This is also explicitly a industry device at first  - a standalone device with a rumored msrp at 3k. This is for studios, companies, and influencers. Its gonna be hella nice, hella expensive, and have a super low volume. What it’s actually going to do is drive attention into the space.>>><<<I could see apple messing up vr if they patent universal good technology, buy out competition, and make exclusive games for their incredibly expensive headset.>>><<<I doubt the Apple headset will have much of a gaming focus. It's just not in Apple's DNA to give a shit about games. Apple Arcade has a couple of bangers, but overall it's kinda half-hearted. And that's their best effort so far, after the hilarious failure of the Pippin and GameSprockets.>>><<<&gt;mainstream vr

It’s like $ 3000>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yeah it's Apple, $3000 will be for the 32GB version.>>><<<Articles were updated around February 4-5th. Other sources now say there's two versions. The $3000 prosumer/enterprise one that will be similar to HoloLens and likely have heavier emphasis on AR, and a more mainstream VR headset around $500-$900 with light AR features. It'll be more than the cost of the Quest 2, but it's also early and the price may drop as the date of release is finalized.>>><<<I hate anything with a locked bootloader including iOS devices and the Oculus Quest 2, but am still happy with *any* competition to the Quest, no matter how good or evil, because that stops any single player from dominating too badly.>>><<<You've got to hand it to facebook though, selling the Rift S at 299 is worth having a FB account imo

they're helping bring VR to the masses>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<If you're willing to exit the hivemind of 'Facebook bad' or just make a burner facebook then it's really not a bad deal>>><<<So much this. I don't even see the point of "bringing VR to the masses" that some people can't wait to see, we've already got plenty of stuff to do in VR and many projects to come in a developping market, why would people think it's a good thing if Facebook make lots of people join their closed ecosystem right now? I see more risks with the competitors giving up because they can't be competitive against the cheap headsets from occulus, then with all the exclusivities they could pay we could be fucked hard.>>><<<the point is, you dimwit, it will bring more quality development due to bigger market and higher potential profits  

even if it would just be android development it would be enough, but quest's bring the desktop usable headset count up as well>>><<<Oh, you're very clever congratulation.>>><<<oh that's just basic economy, but nonetheless, nice of you to notice>>><<<But what does basic economy says about companies not being able to compete against subsidized headsets from Occulus, which wins anyway thanks to what they earn with their closed ecosystem and every bit of intel they could gather with their headsets? Why would they invest in a market if there's already a well established powerful company selling good headsets for cheap? Do you really think there's absolutely no risk, and that it's crucial that many more people join VR as quick as possible?>>><<<you are now describing console market...  
only 2 real mainstream competitors both devices sold at a loss (at least were in previous gens)  
only difference is, the vr is at the beginning with 1/10 (if not less) of the xbox / ps market  
  
I don't care much about which company will be on top - all I care is quality headsets with high ppd, be it pc only or hybrid (don't care much for standalone only if they were to make one)  
  
also.. why would anyone enter smartphone market after first iPhone?  
maybe in a decade everyone will have their own vr set>>><<<There were always competition in the console market and the business model is the same for all competitors, what is doing Facebook is acting like a console producer while the competition is acting like device producer. I don't want closed ecosystems wars, FB is already taking the lead with plenty of exclusivities and subsidized headsets, so it will be harder for competitors to enter the market. This has nothing to do with the iphones, since it was expensive and apple didn't rely on exlusivities. We had a sane competition, facebook is going the wrong way and the one applauding it are the dimwits short-sighted.>>><<<exactly this. i dont give a damn about my Facebook info in exchange for a 200€ price cut 😂>>><<<Only a 200€ price cut?

In Australia your options for a VR headset are Quest 2 or pay around $1000 USD. 

The facebook issue is moot here, there's no other option.>>><<<damn, you aussies should make your own headsets because 1k just aint worth it>>><<<Honestly if they do for VR what they did for smartphones, then I'll happily pay 5-6x the price of an Oculus Quest for one.>>><<<Why?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I assure you most people who buy an oculus do it because of the price. You can hate Facebook and their terrifying way of stealing your information but at the end of the day their headset is sadly quite great in terms of price/quality balance. Apple will datamine too, and force you to login with your Apple account, and force you to play only with Apple products and environments, and will not be compatible with anything else. It's the same shit but worse, and for ten times the price.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Totally agree with the "you're the product" thing which explains the price of the oculus. Sadly though you can't really blame people who go for it because they simply couldn't afford a vr headset otherwise. 

What I fail to see is why wouldn't Apple harvest your data too ? I am 100% sure they already do, every smartphone, every Alexa shit or Siri thing does it. They all do it. When you buy a smartphone from any company, Apple included, you're the product, every time. It really doesn't even matter what they do with the data they steal from you, whether they sell it or keep it. Your data doesnt belong to you anymore and it might as well be public. Apple isn't different from the others.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I mean apple definitely datamines too?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yeah, people need to be more personal data aware>>><<<Not sure if that's a valid excuse to jack up the prices still>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Facebook doesn't have a cloud that's been hacked multiple times. If someone gets my data from Facebook they get a singe  picture of my face from half a decade ago , if someone gets my data from iCloud they have hundreds of my nudes>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<In the same link you posted Apple had 3 breaches and FB 5, not much better

Someone getting my facebook data also doesn't get anything from me because I dont use facebook, I just have an account for vr 

Someone gets my data from my apple account and I'm  fucked>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<BuT aPpLe PhOnEs NeVeR gEt HaCkEd>>><<<&gt; iCloud leaks of the weird shit that people do in Apple VR

I'm not sure people will be able to do weird shit in Apple VR. Anyway if Apple can help to avoid a situation where Occulus dominate everything, I'm all for it. I just hope we will still have competitors outside of these two.>>><<<If you seriously compare a 300$ product to a 3000$+ product you are flat out delusional>>><<<I'd be Apple I'd put the charging port 5mm next to the lens. 

Then make sure to exclude accidental scratching from the warranty cover (should be already it anyway) and then enjoy my $cash cow$ :)>>><<<You need to be an *authorized repair technician* to replace the lenses. Anyone else voids the warranty which you have to pay extra for. Also. In order to become an authorized repair technician, we're gonna need all of the personal information of every customer you've ever had in the past, also you'll need to buy our apple tools. Oh. And pay the fee of course... and the battery cannot be replaced, so we're gonna go ahead and limit your processor speed so it doesn't burn it out. Oh look! A full day has passed! Here's  a new device, only $1500 but look it's slightly better than your current one!>>><<<Look a lot of that is very true, but credit where its due. Apple phones recieve updates for 5 years, which is a hell of a lot longer than any of their competitors>>><<<this is barely english>>><<<I’m not native. Do I need to go to a trial?
Do you really want to shame people for this?
Are you 12?
Was that English enough for you sir?>>><<<There will be an external battery pack to be installed in your sinus cavity.>>><<<Finally a use for our sinuses, they've been sitting there unused when we could have been Johnny Mnemonicing our way through life this whole time.>>><<<You laugh now but I can bet they do that.>>><<<I could afford an Index before an apple headset>>><<<They probably wouldn’t even put a charging port on it>>><<<Yeah it will have wireless charging and you can only use Bluetooth headphones>>><<<Would be annoying if you were a developer tho>>><<<I think it would be annoying regardless>>><<<As a developer I'm gonna say, every headset is annoying to work with, but these which reinvented the wheel, like Oculus, are the most annoying.>>><<<People complain about Facebook oculus shit, because they haven't seen yet ITUNES VR, yes.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<But they're awful in terms of owning your software, media, and devices.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<The walled garden model doesn't require them to actively sabotage repairs or make it impossible to transfer your music to another player. That's just how they've chosen to implement it. They could have all the pluses without those drawbacks, but they choose this.>>><<<Sure if you ignore the tens of thousands of leaked nudes>>><<<I've despised that POS software for about 20 years now, holy crap>>><<<I think I’ll get the version that plugs straight into the [AirPods Subwoofer](https://i.redd.it/0xebad8mza921.jpg) instead.>>><<<My only complaint is that the VR playerbase is too small to have exclusives (Not naming names...ahem), and yet here is another contender who will potentially splinter it off into smaller fragments again.>>><<<They did invent the watch we know that for sure !!! Apple watch first of thé name,king of the andals and all the following shit>>><<<I saw a joke like this before did apple make a vr headset or something>>><<<Coming later this year - some ungody expensive standalone machine with a built in laptop grade processor and dual 8k lenses that they expect will only sell 1 per week per store, apparently.>>><<<Dang. I get it was inevitable though. Reminds me of when they charged 600 (I think) for four little wheels>>><<<I mean, there's a bit of a difference between a set of wheels that're meant to fuck around and maybe make some cash from some dumbass influencers, and a potentially really good product like the apple VR. 3k for a standalone unit is probably a similar cost to what a valve index would cost, between the headset and the gaming PC.>>><<<Oh I see I thought it was just gonna be a slightly better samsung vr for 1k or something it's good to see apple making more quality products>>><<<Taking ideas that other people have had and recombining them into a better package is the essence of innovation. Apple haters are willfully ignorant of the fact that Apple is simply better at creating compelling packages than other companies.>>><<<Yes, yes, we know how much money you spent on your apple products.>>><<<And this is why apple is terrible, and I'll never willing but their products. Also isn't that thing like a grand?>>><<<3 grand>>><<<It doesn’t have a price.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Every headset iteration is examined and learned from, by the competition. A consumer-facing 8K-per-eye, eyetracking-plus-dynamic-foveated standalone headset is a big deal because others can learn from it and make less expensive, comparable products.>>><<<But its not consumer-facing. The leaks suggested this will be an enterprise product.>>><<<I'm sorry but what the actual f***? If this is the final design apple gonna send the vr community back like nintendo did with the virtual boy.>>><<<dude this is a meme>>><<<A meme of a render of a guess at the design, even>>><<<A meme of a possible prototype of a render of a guess at the design of the device, even>>><<<Now that I'm on my computer I see that it's a mouse and that there was a second picture. Tbh though I could see apple doing something stupid like that, but regardless I'm glad this is just a meme.>>><<<See it more as a dev kit, like the Hololens, not a general public accessory. For reference, the Hololens is $4950>>><<<It's rumoured to be more of an enterprise product, not consumer level>>><<<Thing is, Apple really isn’t about the enterprise.

Also, if that headset was able to connect to and virtualize displays, I would buy it in a heartbeat.>>><<<Yeah, there's a reason they aren't about the enterprise: enterprises refuse to pay their exorbitant prices for shit that doesn't work anyway>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Frankly, it's dumb, but not a disaster really.>>><<<You have the curve backwards.>>><<<But do you use it when you charge it? It’s going to be strictly standalone, and probably wirelessly charge in its case, but would it really matter? I get that this is a meme, but practically I don’t see much wrong with it.>>><<<I use my quest while charging, I’ll switch to sth sitting for a half hour then go back to standing, or charge off a power pack>>><<<A lot of people use the quest while charging. Also you could carry an external power brick. This would be a really dumb design, really doubt they'd do it>>><<<How else are you gonna get your superfans to buy multiple of the same product so they can keep using it? By making the device itself very fragile and prevent the user from being able to fix it themselves haha, imagine how ridiculous that'd be.

Oh wait..>>><<<Lenses, processor, charging cable, more expensive model that actually has a fucking charging port all sold separately>>><<<You can't be serious>>><<<You wouldn't want to \*see\* the ports on your devices during operation, would you? Perish the thought!>>><<<Just get the head split surgery for only $120.000, duh.>>><<<I'm getting a psvr2 as soon as that's announced. Lover of minigames or fabulous expensive designs may grab their Quest 4 or iVR>>><<<Apple: This is the way.>>><<<simple hack- in through the anus, out through the mouth>>><<<Nose*>>><<<Head strap and charger sold separately.>>><<<You all have dongles, right?>>><<<I'd be ok with that... I never charge my Quest 2 whilst using it anyway!>>><<<No it’s a terrible design.  The Magic Mouse was great, but that design choice is baffling.>>><<<I’ve heard the reason they designed it that way was so that it would stop people from just keeping it plugged in all the time, thus making the wireless feature pointless. Still inconvenient design though.>>><<<The “but you’re not using it like we intended!” excuse has always annoyed me with Apple’s bad design choices.>>><<<its not even like keeping it plugged in is a bad thing at all. They still paid for a wireless mouse its their choice whether they want to use that feature or not>>><<<I would say that is an excuse apple uses.  They thought being able to see a charging port would ruin the sleek appearance of the device.  It of course would make the best design sense to have said port on the front of the mouse, but that would thicken the profile by a few millimeters, so that clearly could never have been an option.>>><<<That might be pointless, as the whole standalone business model is about the closed ecosystem.

Maybe VIVE XR Elite, dont know what kind of library HTC has.

But its also a giant megacorporation, i bet all of them harvest data.>>><<<To be fair to HTC they make a big deal about not selling your data. It's one of the reasons they are so prevalent in the enterprise space. I give them a lot of credit for sticking to that too - it's a severe handicap when they're going up against the hugely subsidised kit from their competitors.>>><<<this is why i love to live in EU 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_dup6VcRRL8&amp;ab\_channel=SashaYanshin>>><<<Thinking your information hasn’t been sold by everything you’ve used including Reddit in 2023 is pretty fucking hilarious lol>>><<<I don't think they can sell information from me that Google hasn't already sold>>><<<that might be true. lol>>><<<Meta (with Pico as a distant second) are the only standalone headsets with actual games available.


If you wanted a standalone headset for some sort of development or enterprise use, PCVR, or just watching media, then you have Vive XR Elite or Lynx R1.>>><<<Really your only option afaik at this point is HTC's Vive XR Elite, but as a standalone it's pretty lacking at the moment as the store is extremely bare (vast majority of VR staples are not available). A lot of people *really* don't like it, but I've been pretty happy with mine so far since I mainly use it for PCVR - I find it the most comfortable of all the proper headsets I own (Vive/Vive Pro/Quest 2), but this does seem to vary wildly from person to person (guess my head is just the 'right' shape). 

Early reviews were really hard on this device, but it seems to have come on a long way in the last few months. HTC has a Vive Discord set-up, and their devs/PMs seem pretty engaged with it and actively respond to feedback (you can see the genesis of some of the new features in those discussions). People shit on them as a company, but, while they've definitely made mis-steps, I do think they are trying to build a great product and having a player in this space that isn't a front for data-farming can only be a good thing.

Full disclosure: I got mine at an absolutely ridiculously low price (around 1/3 of the RRP), so it didn't burn a huge hole in my pocket. If I had paid full price and didn't already own a Q2 then I would have been way more disappointed by the standalone library for sure - it is a gamble on that library expanding really if standalone is a key requirement, because it just isn't there yet.>>><<<So basically, give information to China or give information to Zuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pick your poison.>>><<<That sucks. those are the two worst options I have ever had in my life.>>><<<You are deaf to the sins of this world>>><<<Thinking aloud: have people tried to “jailbreak” a quest so it sends no telemetry to meta, but you still get to install apps from the quest store?>>><<<Pimax crystal has standalone capabilities.  Lenovo was working on a VR700 not sure if it's out yet or not.   Vive also has a standalone model  XR elite or something like that.>>><<<You could probably build your own with a YouTube Tutorial>>><<<Thinking that reddit doesnt do the same 😂>>><<<Show me this mythical trustworthy company you speak of. You are completely naive if you don't think all of these tech companies do the exact same thing, including the company behind very site you posted this on.>>><<<I'll admit that I've given in to The Collective and joined The Borg.   I figured my data is already everywhere so I'll take advantage of the services that collect it and get the benefit they provide.  Not going to give up Google Maps even though it's creepy when I search for a location and see "you last visited three months ago". 

Think Meta doesn't make money on our headset data?   A few years ago they offered a business version Quest 2 for a few hundred dollars more than a standard version.  Hardware was the same, only difference was no Meta account was needed to use it (something like that, but it was still a "pay more to avoid data collection option").   Yes, they make money on games but part of the cost of the hardware is subsidized by data.>>><<<What kind of data does VR headset collect that's so different to other consoles? Size of your office? The price is mostly subsidized by the game sales, just like any other console on the market. It's the exact same strategy as valve has with their steam deck. That's why it can be cheaper than other devices.

The business headset not only didn't require meta account, it also comes with fast RMA just like business version of other hardware does. Corporate laptops get replaced in a day, servers and network devices in 4 hours. It's probably 1 day for the business quest as well. That's why your home router costs 200€ and the one sold to your workplace costs 10* as much.>>><<<Sure, costs about $20billion since you need to start the company yourself and build the software.Cheaper if you ask Meta if you can use their hardware and just hire programmers to remove the software you don't want.

While we are on the topic, do you not use a phone?  If you do, then this is a moot point.>>><<<Pimax Crystal.>>><<<I have one and it's true it does have standalone but there's only like 10 apps right now so I wouldn't recommend it if you're wanting it for standalone only. The only real use of the standalone I have is watching movies and hopefully eventually having something like virtual desktop for wireless pcvr but right now that's not even on there>>><<<VIVE XR Elite is a only option

but it not how data collections and usage works no one steal you data, because you do not lose anything at all , you "share" , but what you share and how depend on a lot of factors

like meta acc is probably best privacy focus acc from all mega corps because meta is "gatekeeper" Company so EU raped it ass so much meta acc is amazing for privacy , bitedance is not

not only this you need to see this vid [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_hx9S5EclyA&amp;ab\_channel=NBTV%28NaomiBrockwellTV%29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hx9S5EclyA&amp;ab_channel=NBTV%28NaomiBrockwellTV%29) it good information on how your data is used but TLDR no one give a shit about you personal data, you are one of many data point used to target ads

&amp;#x200B;

btw meta do sell headset for cheap not because of data, from FB meta make about 20 eu i a year from one person , it in hope you buy games, and this does make a lot of money, because two games on average price make way more money than one year of data collection, not only this all meta quest users is free beta testers because meta rolls update every 4-8 weeks to add new features and similar stuff, so curent VR users is more or less free testers>>><<<HTC Focus, but I don't recommend it.>>><<<HTC Vive Focus 3 is a standalone. 5k resolution and 120° FOV.   


It's standalone but I don't know what kind of apps are available for it. I don't know if it can work wirelessly with a PC either.>>><<<Everyone gonna complain about FOV and the measurement process, while I'm kind of just lamenting the lack of progress in the controller space, given that Knuckles are still recommended. All the new competitors seem to be gimmicky with major trade-offs like no analog stick. An open version of the Quest Pro controllers would be awesome, but that would take a miracle.>>><<<As someone in a wheelchair, having the knuckles strap onto my hand was such a huge improvement for me. I'll be pretty disappointed if my next setup has to forgo that.>>><<<You can buy hand straps for pretty much every type of controller out there now.>>><<<HTC have been making Quest style headset tracked controllers for their headsets for years now, I don’t understand why they don’t just release a lighthouse version of those.>>><<<Norm’s got a hands on:

https://youtu.be/z3k0T1mvahY>>><<<**A lot of stuff makes sense after watching that.**

It's got Quest Pro price tag but it's hyper personalized, like literally the facial interface is custom made per person from a face scan, the IPD is built-in to the "goggles" for the specific person, and it includes lenses for your own eyeglass prescription.

This this is the ultimate light/small 5k OLED VR headset, trying to be comfortable and customized for long use for people already heavily invested in the VR industry.  It's like an F1 team building the car's seat for the specific driver, except for a VR headset.

It's not trying to be your first VR headset, or the headset you show other people VR for the first time with.

In context, this price point feels appropriate, IMO.

(If I was still doing a lot of simracing and simflying in VR, I'd be all over this thing.  Sadly, I don't have the time for anything except a casual hour here and there in VR these days, so the HOTAS, wheel+pedals+stand, etc are collecting dust.)>>><<<Yeah that was a good video, and very impressed by Darshan and how forthcoming he was about their objectives, and what the headset could and couldn't do.  Down to earth guy who wasn't trying to oversell anything.

Still a little too rich for me, approaching nearly $2k if you need to get the base stations and controllers, but I really like a lot of the concepts here.  This video proves to me that weight is one of the most neglected aspects of headsets today, and I'm dying to try something like this in the 150g range.  That is awesome and I really appreciate that they chose to focus on this aspect for their product.>>><<<I'm curious how good it would be for office work. That's what I'm waiting on in the vr/ar space. I want to lay in bed comfortably And be productive with 16 desktops open while petting my dog>>><<<I've been waiting for something useful to work in VR, and it looks like this could be it! My hammock and Datahands have also been waiting.>>><<<I settled down more (wasn't angry, just baffled) after watching the Norm video and ThrillSeeker even did an balanced impression of it. 

Intellectually, I understand everything the CEO is going for and all the points he makes does sound good. ThrillSeeker said this is perfect for him because, yes, he's on PCVR all the time and there is so much bulk on his Index he no longer needs - why is it still bulky like a standalone in 2023? PCVR at this time should be lighter since it's not doing on-board computing or using a battery like a Quest 2, and this is where the BigScreen Beyond comes in for PCVR enthusiasts.

However, at the same time, I can't shake off the hurdles. The price and base stations and controllers and no passthrough. Not to mention glasses users are required to spend another $80 on prescription insets. If money wasn't an object, this does seem like a great headset to have. But everyone's goal is to make money and grow a company. Will this headset do that? Seems really hard at this point, especially in this economic climate.>>><<<Yes, I do think it's going to be tough to sell enough of these.  I think the market they are targeting is like 3 niches down within VR.

If this thing is treated like a prototype, and they only plan to sell a few thousand, they might be fine.  Maybe they see it as a stepping stone to a wider-market VR product.  If they think this thing is going to explode and sell even 10% of Quest sales, they are delusional.  But I get the feeling they are being realistic about it.>>><<<&gt; It's not trying to be your first VR headset, or the headset you show other people VR for the first time with.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In context, this price point feels appropriate, IMO.

its also not the VR headset you can resell easily.         
so shelling out +1k for a thing that you know you are going to keep and wont be able to resell should you want or need to is definetly aimed at a certain limited public.>>><<<I mean, that's me.  I haven't sold ANY of my VR headsets.  Even the ones I never want to touch again. By the time I get to that point, they are worth like $80...>>><<<This is me as well. I only have a reverb G2 and cardboard, but I don’t think I’d ever sell them (at least not for a long time) or whatever headsets I end up with in the future. It’s the same reason why I’ve never gotten rid of any of my Nintendo devices, for example. There’s the nostalgia factor, but sometimes it’s just cool to revisit old hardware to see how things have progressed. They become both technological and personal artifacts. Strangely (or perhaps not), I really don’t care about keeping my old iPhones. Which I’d guess is probably due to the fact that I update them more frequently and that they remain largely unchanged from one iteration to the next.

Long story short, I don’t usually consider the near-term resale potential of a device when purchasing it, and I’d guess many others don’t either.

And, in Thrillseeker’s video, he says that the custom components can be removed so that you can resell it, and the buyer can then purchase those custom parts from the company afterwards. So you’re really only eating the cost of the custom parts.>>><<<That's the one I was waiting for. Tyvm for sharing!>>><<<Lot's of hate in this thread. Obviously not for everyone but if your primary use is consuming content like movies etc. or even productivity-related tasks this could be really sick. It also pushes competitors to make sharper and lighter headsets. This is their Gen 1 after all and people are freaking out.>>><<<Yea, there seem to be a lot of people that can't see past their own preferences.

I know perfectly well that devices that are not for me, are not automatically failures. I don't get why that is a hard thing to understand.>>><<<Its like avacados or pineapple on pizza… some people struggle seeing past their own preferences and they pass judgment on everything as if their standards are THEE standard lol>>><<<Eugh, I know what you mean, I remember some guy on here who was complaining about still using an HTC Vive saying he wanted a 'next generation' VR headset, and lots of people were explaining to him how the contemporary lineup of recent release and upcoming releases were 'next generation' and it turns out dudebro just had extremely arbitrary definition of what constitutes 'next generation'.>>><<<&gt; I know perfectly well that devices that are not for me, are not automatically failures. 

Because it's not a big enough market to be a niche inside a niche.>>><<<I think there's this underlying (and I'd say fallacious) assumption that the VR industry is a zero-sum game, i.e. the effort that went into this headset "could have" been put into a different kind of headset. On this subreddit, this theoretical headset seems to be a high FOV OLED pancake uncompressed DP PCVR that's not too bulky and under $1K.

VR is still burgeoning, but seems to now be at this awkward stage where more and more headsets are being released, but each new headset is still "big news" to the community, attracting close, often "passionate" scrutiny. I'm glad we have these vocal critics. But it's also an inevitability, and actually a good sign of growth, that headsets are diversifying to fill a variety of needs and niches.

With a few exceptions, we generally don't care about each new laptop or phone that comes out, we just research it when it comes time to get a new one. It might be a slow climb, but eventually, VR hardware will reach that point.>>><<<&gt; Lot's of hate in this thread. 

Welcome to /r/virtualreality Everything is hated instantly unless it come from Valve.>>><<<lol are you kidding? people spend half of their day here trying to shit on the index as being outdated caveman tech.>>><<<I shit on it because it's never been made available here in Australia.>>><<<As do i

Death to the index, send the roos out>>><<<You do know it’s often available via EBGames right? Though I reshipped mine via a friend in the US way before it was at EB>>><<<If I made a Quest 2 or Index thread, guess which one gets downvotes faster.

Not saying Index doesn't get shit on from time to time, but it's the favored son over here, and Meta/Quest 2 are deemed the inbred, toothless invaders according to some angry posts.>>><<<gonna go out on a limb... looks cool, might buy.>>><<<Ppl who are dishing on this thing - why?

This is everything I'm looking for in a headset.

* FOV - small, but it uses pancake lenses, so you will get better mileage out of the actual usable viewable "sweet spot"
* PPD - yes please
* MicroOLED Panels - yes
* Weight - so much yes
* Lighthouse tracking - fuck yea
* Displayport - you win
* Form Factor - there's nothing close to this right now
* A PCVR headset - THANK YOU

This headset does everything I want.  It scrapped all the nonsensical crap that isn't ready for showtime yet and gave us a good display with display port.  This is what I've been waiting for in PCVR, personally.  It's why I was hyped in the sameway for the meganex shiftall, but that one doesn't look like it got a good reception due to issues with the optics.

Is it expensive? Relatively, yes.  But this is a smaller company and i'll take that startup "tax".  Is it inflexible? Yes, this is a con.  You won't be able to share this headset.  For me though, I'm kind of past the "party trick" phase of VR (and I mean kudos to you if you're entertaining a lot and VR is a thing that occurs, not downplaying that aspect of the hobby). For me personally, I'm the one using the VR headset almost always so this is not as big of an issue for me.

This is the one.  The only thing I could see supplanting this is Apple coming out and saying they will support SteamVR.>>><<<Exactly all this. Thank you for communicating it so well.

I want to acknowledge that this isn't for everybody. But we intentionally wanted to focus on weight, comfort, resolution, OLED etc. We wanted to push the bounds of immersion and comfort. 127 grams vs. 700-800 grams. 28 PPD vs. 10-20 PPD. For some people, this will be the right tradeoff for them.

Also, our displays and optics alone cost more than a Quest costs haha. It's pricey next-generation materials that are just coming to market, and are not yet able to be manufactured at the scale of millions of units. Micro-OLED hasn't come down the "cost curve" yet.>>><<<Thanks!  Are you from the Bigscreen team? :O

Love what you are doing with this!  My one "please can I have this" is...have you reached out to nofio for wireless support? :)>>><<<That appears to be Darshan Shankar, CEO of Bigscreen.>>><<<I gotta say, one aspect I love of the weird internet future we live in is that we'll randomly be talking to someone on a thread like these, and it turns out they're actually some bigwig.>>><<<Since it uses Micro-OLED displays, how bright is the device? Can it use HDR?>>><<<[Norm speculated on the panels they use](https://youtu.be/z3k0T1mvahY?t=1145)] and they have a 3,000 nits rating. But I wouldn't get too hyped about that number as Norm also said the headset doesn't feel very bright so it's likely due to the pancake lens you're only getting a small fraction of it's dynamic range.>>><<<Throw in a couple free 3d movie rentals and you got yourself a deal. I'm super interested in this headset.>>><<<Do you know if it will support 3 DoF tracking with an Xbox controller and no Lighthouse Base Stations? Also is the cable proprietary or will you be able to replace it with a shorter or longer aftermarket cable?

I don't have much experience with SteamVR tracking so I'll have to look into that a bit more, but so far it looks like Bigscreen Beyond addresses all of the major issues I had with the Quest Pro with the only real tradeoff for me being potentially worse controllers and a lack of color passthrough. Although I never use passthrough on my Reverb G2 and mostly use an Xbox controller so neither of those are deal breakers especially if standalone 3 DoF is working. I'm really looking forward to seeing some reviews though, hopefully it's as great in person as it looks on paper!>>><<<Watch this, for about 1 minute: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3k0T1mvahY&amp;t=900s>>><<<&gt;Do you know if it will support 3 DoF tracking with an Xbox controller and no Lighthouse Base Stations?

I would also like to know the answer to this question.>>><<<Watch this, for about 1 minute: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3k0T1mvahY&amp;t=900s>>><<<I would also like to know if 3dof without lighthouse tracking might work.>>><<<Yeah, this really does hit a lot of my win points too. 

One of the issues I have with it is the fully custom face cushion being a requirement and needing an iPhone to get the 3D mapping done. I have no clue how complicated it would be to have generic cushions for a headset this size, but I think having an option for it would be nice. But I get the sell: It's YOUR headset. 

Another is definitely price. For me and my shit eyes, I'd need to get the custom lens inserts. Very cool with the magnetic mounting, but I fear how much these will cost me (VROptician set me back ~300USD for my Index). 

Still, very interested in this headset.>>><<<$79 [https://store.bigscreenvr.com/products/prescription-lens-inserts-for-beyond](https://store.bigscreenvr.com/products/prescription-lens-inserts-for-beyond) \- see if the range of opthalmic options will suit.>>><<<That's pretty cheap. And flat rate too? 

Not too shabby honestly>>><<<I'm also happy with this.  I've been stuck with an OG Vive Pro forever because I can't stand LED black levels.  Add in a mic that people won't bitch about in world, and that's all I really want.  I've got all the gear, I don't want my next headset to waste precious budget on peripherals and tracking that I already have.

What would be really cool is if version 2 skimps even more and I could hold on to my lenses / custom face-mask.

But... why are you excited about DisplayPort?  What am I missing?>>><<<I'm in the same boat. Still clinging to my Vive Pro for those inky blacks and wireless.

A little disappointed by the FOV, but I kept saying if another PCVR headset came out with OLED that I would put my money where my mouth is.>>><<<I've come to expect that from this subreddit. Everyone want's something different, so no matter what comes out there are people who complain. And due to human nature, it seems, complaints get the most upvotes.>>><<<I guess I'll have to go borrow my brothers iphone to do the scan thing. This looks absolutely insane for the kind of sim driving/flying I like to do in VR. The weight alone makes it worth the price to me, oled/resolution, etc is great too.>>><<<I realize that the FOV is a dealbreaker for most in this subreddit... but it's overall a very exciting product and the V2 will likely have a better FOV.  This is just their first go at it... and a very impressive result at that!>>><<<It clearly is a high-end proof-of-concept anyway. This isn't trying to match Pimax or PSVR2 in terms of fov, it's trying to be ultra compact - and it looks like it achieved that. This is the kind of device size I'd be happy with in the future.>>><<<It's pretty much a perfect device size. So many people I know don't play VR anymore just because it's generally uncomfortable and the games/game play are not that good 

If we could make future hmds at this size without the sacrifice in other areas, I think this has a chance to change a lot for VR>>><<<Yeah, people need to realize that with commercially available early 2020s technology, it's a pretty direct inverse relationship between form factor and fov.   


I think it's very impressive for what it is.>>><<<In an interview, they said light, small, high res, and OLED where their targets.  They knew they couldn't achieve them without accepting what-they-describe-as "Quest" FOV.  To be fair, clearly the vast majority of the market is ok with Quest's FOV, so I understand why they did that to achieve 5K OLED in a package the size of swimming goggles.>>><<<Are they committed to a V2 even if this thing completely flops as is likely?>>><<<Well this company at least has relatively successful software to stay afloat.>>><<<There probably wont be a V2 unless this is successful.>>><<<The form factor is cool. The size/weight alone seems like it would be extremely comfortable (given the custom faceplate, but the iOS requirement for the scan is an odd limiting factor). FOV is around Quest 2 levels, so definitely a trade-off to allow for the pancake/high res displays. 

My largest issue is the 1k cost for JUST the headset. That is a bit much given that you still need lighthouse trackers and knuckles controllers just to use the thing (and that tacked on makes an expensive product even more so).

2x the cost of an Index headset for smaller/higher-res seems like a lot when lowering FOV, worse audio, cheaper headstrap, etc. Granted, you're really paying for the Mirco-OLED here, and for some that may be worth an upgrade. Just depends on the type of user you are.

It is still interesting. Always glad to see new competition in this space.>>><<<IOS has always been ahead for photogrammetry related tasks because of their depth sensors.>>><<<The cost appears to be a result of those OLED displays. [Norm mentions](https://youtu.be/z3k0T1mvahY?t=1162) that he thinks he found the display they are using and to buy one it costs $500 so it does seem likely the bulk of the cost of this headset is the displays.>>><<<Plus not eye tracking>>><<<More info on it: https://www.bigscreenvr.com/

Deal breaker imho: https://ibb.co/xHWjSp6>>><<<Not fixed ipd?>>><<<It is fixed to exactly your IPD. It’s custom made for your face.>>><<<Great, so when my friends want to try it I order another headset?>>><<<Cas specifically says Both Cas and Chary got to try it out, and when Cas tried out Chary's headset it was extremely uncomfortable, though her own special headset was great.  

so yes, it seems like it's something you won't be able to share with friends and family.>>><<<In fairness, if you shelling out that level of cash for this type of product, I don't foresee many people openly sharing it. It's different when it's a Quest or HP Reverb. But when a company specifically claims it's custom designed for you, you're not buying it with sharing in mind.>>><<<No surprise, they have pretty different facial geometry>>><<<The face gasket was uncomfortable not the headset itself Jesus fucking Christ dude people's comprehension these days is so fucking bad>>><<<It’s not for that use case. This is supposed to be the best possible or experience for *you*. If you want to share it, then this isn’t the headset for you. That said, anyone who’s a millimetre or two in either direction will be fine since the sweet spot is much bigger.>>><<<When your friends want to try it, they order another headset.>>><<<Honestly, the stupid iPhone requirement is the real deal breaker.>>><<<"don't you guys have iPhones?">>><<<*Into the trash it goes*>>><<<Oh that sucks, agreed.>>><<<The iPhone is the only device that can do sub-millimeter scans that produce an accurate face scan. Also, the process isn't a custom app, it will be a QR code so store display models can do the scan just fine!>>><<<&gt; it will be a QR code so store display models can do the scan just fine!

That's a great point which wasn't clear to me! I have no phone and no Apple product... in the Venn diagram of devices I *don't* own, an iPhone is probably in the middle.>>><<<Meh, and here I thought my Revopoint 3d scanner could do it.>>><<<are you happy with the revopint 3d scanner? I saw the kickstarter a while ago, but didnt go for it. Been wondering what the final result was.>>><<<Double deal breaker £1,149.00!>>><<<oh man that fov...>>><<<This sub is cancer. Instead of killing the baby before it lands in the cradle, we should be celebrating the little advancements if we ever want this industry to progress. 90hz 2560px OLED?? Practically glasses form factor??

The face scan with iPhone is a major bummer, considering the majority of the world uses Android... but can we at least wait until people get their hands on it before we strike down one more entry into the cast?>>><<<This sub has been oddly disinterested in new HMDs compared to others. I remember there being big excitement for any news about new HMDs on the Vive subreddit.

While this is not for me, it has like you say got some clear advantages to most other products on the market. And I hope they will do well enough to make future products.>>><<<It's the fact these vr subs skew incredibly young and they know their parents won't buy them a headset that cost more than $300 so they 'hate it' to not feel bad about their quest 2.>>><<<I think the Quest 2 part of your comment is particularly relevant.

Unfortunately, the Q2 has set a bar for many people... one that even Meta cannot now beat. The Q2 brought in many new potential VR enthusiasts... but ones who expect VR to just get better in all ways *and* cheaper from there. But it was far underpriced for the tech.>>><<<I'd upgrade my index to this instantly. That weight and formfactor is very interesting.>>><<<Yea, folks that already have the base-stations and controllers are their best chance of reaching enough people to pay the bills.>>><<<Holy, that looks incredibly promising, although I can see multiple things that make me question how well it will perform on the market.

It seems to have no IPD adjustment but rather the IPD gets custom built for you, meaning it will be hard to sell on the 2nd hand market.

It also has no inside out tracking capabilities, limiting it's market to people who already have base stations and controllers.

It's FOV is mediocre, at \~90 degrees.

Starting at 1400 euros I personally think this is a hard sell.  


But we'll have to wait and see for reviewers to test it.>>><<<Definitely a hard sell. The custom built specs are nice, but now I think its what would tack on extra cost and make it hard to resell as you mentioned, unless the 3D printing community or 3rd party market steps in for this lack. 

They tout 6x lighter than other headsets on the market. It would’ve been impressive if they even cut that weight by half or more and add in adjustable IPD and better FOV. Lightweight is great but it looks like they left out some other features>>><<<I don't want big fov, but come one give us at least pico 4 or quest pro fov.>>><<<I have no comparison. Been on the Quest 1 apparently with 90 FOV and I’m still impressed in general. I bought it for $400 with controllers brand new and felt it was game-changing.

I’m loving this new push for better functionality, lighter weight and sleek form factors but I’ll always be sold with the original release of headset, controllers and a price not breaking 1k USD.>>><<<The Quest 1 has more than 90, it's actually much better than the Quest 2.

I'm telling you, the fact that this barely reaches Q2 FOV is a big fail.>>><<<The FOV is 93 degrees, and YMMV. For some it will be closer to 95 degrees HFOV, which is 1 degree shy of the Quest 2

For resale, other people with a similar IPD will be able to use the headset easily. If they wish, they can also order a custom foam cushion from us to use with their second-hand headset.

It’s designed to be the optimal fit for you, and your IPD never changes so we opted to significantly reduce the weight.>>><<<Thanks for clarifying. But is there at least a manual way of changing IPD? Even if we have to grab a screwdriver?>>><<<Congrats on this and your success with BigScreen as a whole. It’s a wise move to attack the form factor head on- it’s most certainly one of the largest impediments to adoption. (One that veterans and enthusiasts underestimate)>>><<<Does your device accommodate optical asymmetry (i.e. vertical and lateral offset per eye)>>><<<mediocre is generous.>>><<<90 DEGREES FOV - More like *lack of view.*>>><<<It's pretty clear that the majority of VR users value a larger FOV (120-130 degree would be the sweet spot, but very few are hitting even that).

But at the same time, it's hard to deny in a saturated VR headset market that there isn't a niche room for light weight high fidelity headset like this thing is showing to be.

I'm personally very curious - it'd be quite good as a secondary headset... and at 1k for the HMD, it might actually be a semi-viable-ish buy for a VR enthusaist - assuming you already have the other parts.

It's the sort of thing where you'd want to use it for a few hours to evaluate the value that the form factor brings to the table - because it really is a next gen form factor - the sort of device where the friction for long term comfort is significantly reduced, and I can see people starting to use for prolonged periods to do their daily computing in!>>><<<Fail Of View.>>><<<More resolution. FOV and resolution is always a trade-off, but for using a VR Monitor with pancake lenses I bet it's a good one!>>><<<Flop Of View>>><<<The FOV is 93 degrees, and YMMV. For some it will be closer to 95 degrees HFOV, which is 1 degree shy of the Quest 2. You’ll be hard pressed to notice an FOV difference to the Quest 2 in practice.>>><<<Thank you but no. $1400 in europe for a headset that doesn't come with controllers and base stations? and has a fov of 90 ?  Yeah, bye. 1000 dollars maybe WITH EVERYHING ( controllers and base stations). Also anything less than pico 4/quest pro FOV is an absolute NO for me.>>><<<The headset is not for you, but so many of these responses are so shortsighted. This type of headset, in terms of size and weight and resolution is EXACTLY what VR needs. Now if we could increase the fov in future iterations and the lower the price, I see it as a game changer. 

This is an exciting headset. And I might buy it and sacrifice the fov, just to finally have potentially a really comfortable lightweight hmd with good visuals

Let's see reviews first tho>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I'm sure custom faceplate and optics might feel great, and I know they're not Meta, but I feel weird sending any tech company a scan of my face. We'll see if reviewers rave about the comfort when it actually releases, but its interesting>>><<<It's a neat idea but the price point makes it such a lackluster option. If you're willing to spend so much on VR, you're probably willing to deal with a big and heavy headset because you want the VR no matter what. Nobody who wasn't sold on VR already will buy a headset at its price just because it's lighter and less bulky.>>><<<It's not about selling people on VR, but keeping them in it. How many of us are enthusiastic for VR and excited for it's future, but hate the way we feel when we've worn the hmd for a couple of hours

I'm not necessarily hyped for this hmd, because I don't have any experience with the company's hardware, but I am hyped about the form factor of VR headsets finally changing>>><<<I think the comfort is the ultimate feature. I can spend in vr maybe an hour or two, before my head hurts. The fact, that is custom made for the user, is awesome and justifies the price. But no passthrough is unfortunately a deal breaker for me.>>><<<Is your goal to have AR features?

That's something I still want to see improve in headsets, but when the headset is so easy to lift off your eyes and will fit perfectly back onto your face this seems better than ever for hopping in and out of VR.>>><<<Looks amazing and is finally "PCVR as small as possible". Quest Pro compared to an Index is so thin so seeing a company push how small an HMD can be is amazing. PCVR doesn't have a lot of new games that im excited for and I cant justify upgrading if I only play VRChat.>>><<<I’m in. Sold. Already have Vive hardware and Index controllers. Vive is on its way out the door. I’ve been waiting for a new OLED headset and it looks like this is it. My primary uses are Beat Saber and Elite Dangerous. Deep blacks are my number one priority. This looks SICK.>>><<<I'm curious about how it feels for beat saber, all their demo cases seem to focus on sitting non-active experiences.>>><<<Here’s why I’m optimistic about this:
Although this isn’t a value headset, it’s still half the cost of the Varjo Aero. There is now an option with proper OLED and pancake lenses. I didn’t even know OLED+pancake was possible because pancake lenses are so inefficient with light, so you really have to crank the brightness. I thought we were gonna have to wait for mini led to move away from LCD on pancake.

Also, consider that you can get this plus two base stations and index controllers for a similar cost as Quest Pro. That’s a serious improvement compared to something like Aero. I expect this to be the new clarity king based on the specs.

I personally care way way more about PPD than FOV. That’s why G2 is my favorite headset and it’s not even close. I haven’t bought Aero because $2,700 all in is just too much for me. Reducing the cost by a grand is quite intriguing if nothing else.>>><<<Yeah, it’s not cheap and not for everyone but the same can be said about a number of competing headsets. For some people and use cases it should be great.>>><<<I also really like how they customize it just for you as well. Honestly that has to be a logistics nightmare but it makes total sense to me. They could just sell a gasket to someone else in the future if you sell it. Most people fall within a slim IPD range anyway. Idk the offering makes sense to me and I’m really tempted by it. I hate how long it is away!>>><<<Pretty sick product if your intent is to use it for more entertainment than gaming. I can see Bigscreen making a good push for this if customers want to enjoy watching imax movies and the lines using their product. The resolution is miles better than anything else out in that price range.>>><<<The possible media-consumption audience is huge, but unfortunately, the part of that audience willing to invest that much cash plus the hassle of SteamVR tracking seems like it will be tiny.>>><<<For now... tech will get better and less cumbersome. It has to start somewhere =) The way I see it is that BigScreen was just an VR theater app that is now also dropping VR tech. If they can make sizable investments like this, imagine what other startups can also produce. I wholly welcome competition. It's only the end consumers that benefit

I can't wait for the future of media-consumption via VR>>><<<This headset ticks every box for productivity workers too. The limitations for that use case always been PPD and comfort, not FOV.>>><<<$2000 including controllers and base stations for a 90 degree FOV headset. No thanks.

EDIT - And an extra $99 for the audio solution.

EDIT - I just checked using a VPN and in Germany the Valve Knuckes are 300EUR and 2x base stations are 320EUR. That is 620EUR.The headset price from the Bigscreen website shipped to Germany (free shipping btw) is 1370 EUR, which is a HUGE 45% increase over the $999 price in the USA.

So altogether, it is 1370EUR + 620EUR = 1990EUR = $2132 all-in with headset, knuckles and base stations. That's without the audio strap.

So yeah... the European price of this headset package is a legitimate joke for what you get here.>>><<<Where are you getting $2000 from? Shouldn’t it be $1500 if you don’t have base stations?>>><<<Yeah and it's not even 120hz. Also I need to buy now an iphone too if I want to buy it.>>><<<What does it need an iphone for, just for the facial interface / ipd map thing or to actually operate it once you have it?>>><<<Some of you wanted a PCVR headset, you got it.

I agree with thrill's opinion of it in that what makes this headset great is that it takes advantage of PCVR's offboarding of computation to aggressively push the form factor all the way down to just the tracking and the core optics and displays.   


In that sense, this is like a pure specimen of a PCVR headset.>>><<<Looks good. I'm absolutely dying to throw my money at a next-gen PCVR headset.

The real deal breaker for me with this headset is the field of view>>><<<The headset's about Quest 2's FOV - we do fall behind some other headsets in terms of FOV, but to innovate on other parts of the headset like form-factor, comfort, resolution &amp; OLED displays, that's a trade-off we've had to make.

As for reselling, IPD is the trickiest part. In any case we'll offer separate custom cushions as well, which should help.>>><<<This headset sure has a lot going for it. 

Coming from the G2 I'm personally looking for a wider fov -- even if that means compromising on comfort and form factor.

I hope this is  a success though>>><<<This looks great for watching movies. I’m glad there is more competition.>>><<<Well, this came out of nowhere. Personally, I can certainly deal with the 90 degree FOV given all of the other craziness that the headset offers... .but you can only buy it if you have an Iphone?? What? What a strange decision.>>><<<I don't mind that FOV or fixed ipd, but I do wish it were wireless. Seems to defeat the purpose of ultralight if you're gonna be tethered.

V2 should be fantastic. Honestly I feel like I would make the FOV vs clarity trade off any day. It's like wearing small glasses - - you trade your fov for clarity>>><<<Yeah I like many others have an issue with the FOV which made me completely shrug it off on impulse. So it won’t be a replacement for the Quest Pro (or whatever high end headset you own) for GAMING use.

However, I think this will be a great unit for several reasons:

-	the lens technology will offer an excellent picture for the FOV you do have, and pancake lenses will  offset the low FOV due to additional clarity across the whole viewing range. This means I think the unit will be a GREAT movie watching headset, which I still have yet to find.

-	small form factor means very light weight and portable. I use a quest pro now and it’s even less portable feeling than the quest 2 was. This should appeal to a larger audience on that alone. Absolutely a nice offering.

This is another competitor in the space. We need this to push the technology forward and continue innovation. They’re releasing a small form factor headset  -AND- it is PCVR. PCVR is on life support and this is going to keep interest going. It is quite expensive, but that’s what you get for being an early adopter of any technology. I believe the Micro OLED tech is the most expensive part of the unit and is why it is so expensive, but 2-3 years down the pipe they’ll be better developed. We need to support companies like this because they keep our dreams of great VR alive. Look at it this way. If this is their first foray into VR headsets and they create a successful small form factor unit, we will have renewed interest in PCVR which could mean more games, more people playing VR on PC, and ultimately more competition means better technology. They could even focus on creating a valve index competitor in the future.

All in all, bravo and I hope this lands>>><<<I also think the on-paper specs can only tell you so much. It's possible that in practice, the greater clarity (as you said), along with being able to move your head around effortlessly, could sufficiently offset the unimpressive FOV. Plus, like all headsets, there are many other intangible factors that can only be taken into account after using it for at least a few weeks, especially for a headset this unique. And this doesn't have to sell millions, it just has to be successful enough to allow them to fund the development of v2, which *could* be that unicorn HMD that most folks want here. I look forward to when non-reviewers get their hands on these and start sharing their thoughts.>>><<<My wife would buy this over a Quest 2 in a heartbeat because of the design. Not everything is for the hardcore gamer even though it can handle it.>>><<<So some thoughts:

* The size and weight is a BIG FUCKING PLUS. While a lot of us who are already in the VR space don't mind current VR HMD sizes and weights, for mainstream adoption to occur, we need devices in this size/weight specification. VR HMDS like the G2 are already really light and comfortable but its bulky size is still a turn off for a lot of people that try it.

* The fact that out of the box it is directly compatible for SteamVR basestations is a HUGE PLUS if you are already in that ecosystem. I do think that even with the push for better camera style tracking in Windows Mixed Reality type VR HMDs, the SteamVR basestation tracking provides a much more accurate and better overall VR experience. If you already have the basestations and controllers (and the tracking pucks if you want full body tracking in social stuff like VRChat), this seems like a huge win. I use a Valve Index for all movement-based VR experiences and a G2 in my simrig.

* The COST to PERFORMANCE for this product is really horrid. I am someone that thinks current FOV in most VR HMDs (anywhere between ~100 and ~115 degrees of FOV) is a good amount; I don't think it needs to be much larger as we've seen VR HMDs that go larger have fish-eying effects on the periphery of the view. However, 90 degrees of FOV...at a cost of $1000 (and that's just the HMD; no integrated audio solution or tracking tech)...is a huge fucking ask IMO. Also the frame rate doesn't seem to exceed 90hz which given how much people love the Index for going up to 144hz (I use mine at 120hz), this could also be a huge downgrade.

* You need an iPhone to buy the thing (looks like you need it to scan your face before purchasing)? That's a huge wtf. There are an absolute fuck ton of people who use Android phones. What, you gotta find a friend with an iPhone? What if you are in a situation where you know literally NO ONE that has an iPhone? Why force people to even use an iPhone? This seems like an extremely limiting step for an already niche product. 

I wanna really like it because I do think the overall physical footprint of VR HMDs need to shrink down to something like this formfactor...but at that cost>>><<<Bigscreen is my favorite app. Fingers crossed that the split priorities between software and hardware doesn't make them lose the ability to work on making the app better.

Questions I need answered about the headset:
Battery life?
Cost?
Controllers?
Standalone or wired?
Why?>>><<<&gt; Cost?

Pre-order is £1,149...>>><<<It’s steam lighthouse tracked so you can use any controllers that will work with that. It’s PCVR only with a dedicated DisplayPort connection.>>><<<The headset is only wired, so you don't need to worry about the battery life. The preorder cost is $1,000 USD for the headset and flexible strap. Base stations and controllers will need to be bought separately. They have an audio strap that you can buy or use your own headphones to hear. There are no built-in speakers, but the mic is great. The most important thing to know about the headset is that it is PCVR only. It is not stand alone, all the power comes from your computer.>>><<<Bradley just dropped a video covering it too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvih_ljVc_w>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Inside out tracking is not a plus unless it comes from Facebook where they got it working reasonably well. Most of us want accurate tracking.>>><<<pico tracking is also good enough.>>><<<No, *you*need to add the additional base stations.

People who have base stations, and have had them since the vive, need to do nothing.

"My thoughts and values must represent everyone, no one uses valve Base station tracking because I don't use it"

The 20% of VR users on steam with valve Base stations: 🤔🤔>>><<<I was very exited at first : micro oled, very small form factor, steamVR tracking, perfectly adjusted ipd... this was the perfect headset.

Then come the bad news : Quest 2 fov, disapointing, but i can go over it. High res without eye tracking, very disapointing too, but it didnt kill the headset yet.

But i am euro citizen, between the extremly high price and the requirement for a super rare phone (no i dont know anyone using an iphone even in extended circles). That thing is doa for me.

Good news is that Bigscrfeen should have plenty of time custom crafting the face masks :/>>><<<People come here surprised that there are many people who claim that they don't know anyone who has an iphone... well, to their surprise, outside of north america not many people have iphones. I'm from europe and I don't know anyone with an iphone. There are only 2 persons that I ever knew that had an Iphone. A cousin a few years ago because the company where he worked gave him one and a childhood friend that I met again 5-6 years ago.  Right now I don't know anyone with an iphone.>>><<<This is incredibly confusing to me. Even in the poor Eastern European countries there is still 10 to 20% iPhone ownership. Do you not know 5 to 10 people?>>><<<They are only releasing in the US to start. European release is later, maybe to give them time to do an Android version of their scanning app.>>><<<They also need to fix the pricing before trying something for the euro market. Right now it doesnt make sense.>>><<<&gt; (no i dont know anyone using an iphone even in extended circles)

That amazes me. People I know are split about 50/50 iPhone/Android.>>><<<I just have one very important question, will it support prescription lens inserts? Im sure someone out there will be able to 3d print a lens holder that fits over the VR headset lenses but this is always important because I refuse to wear glasses with any VR headset.>>><<<Yup - it is mentioned at the end of the landing page. They provide custom lenses up to -10.00 with astigmatism support>>><<<If this had higher fov, wireless, and eye tracking, I'd pre-order. 

But $1500 CAD for this is is a no from me right now. My index is still working fine, I'll use that until the next big thing.>>><<<"I hate this thing. I want a $300 vr headset that is wireless, 150 degree fov, with eye tracking.....but still has everything this headset has" - vr dreamer>>><<<This is truly innovative. I hope they can pull it off. Wish they’d do an inside-out tracked version though.>>><<<Idk I feel like that’s what killed the G2. I’m kinda down with just steam vr support. I just wish one could get 2 basestations and index controllers for like $299 instead of twice that.>>><<<That thing looks cool, but the price is *incredibly* steep and I don't see the outstanding features that justify it. Yeah, it's small and light and it has a high resolution.

But is the FOV better than current headsets? Why is there no included audio at that price? 

Plus, high resolution means beefy system. My measly 1070Ti won't cut it and I don't have the money for a bigger card at the current prices.

In conclusion, this headset is not for me and I'm not even sad about it. I'd rather have wireless than lighter anyway. But even that not at *that* pricepoint...>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I'm pretty sure these same people would also call the Shitfall too expensive.>>><<<1k for the headset. 100 for the audio strap. 580 for base stations and controllers. The price is adding up fast.

Limited FOV. Fixed IPD, no wireless, which is a feature a lot of people want in these small form factors for being on the go. It seems like a niche product in a niche market. I get sacrifices need to be made for this small form factor, but I am not willing to make those at this price.

I think headsets like these will be more common in the next couple of years for a much lower prices. It seems like an expensive movie watcher rather than a daily driver.

I do wish Bigscreen success.>>><<<If you want wireless *while* keeping it on the same size/weight as it currently is (aka swimming goggles size factor) then you're asking for a non-existing technology or you have military-sized budget. Batteries do be heavy

But yeah, this is a niche device hyperfocusing on one aspect of VR and making sacrifices on the rest. There is a *small* market for it in this already niche hobby>>><<<We see with the nofio that it's possible without too much additional bulk. So no it's not impossible.

Even if they had an attachment for wireless, that would probs be enough for me. I'd pay extra for it. No option for wireless and no eye tracking addon is a killer for me.>>><<<On one hand, this is a godsend for people who mainly care about watching, reading, or even working in VR like me. 90 FOV is enough for enjoying 3D, IMAX-like experiences at home. Hell, if you can use your phone as a remote like with the Nreal then you might don't even need to invest in a Lighthouse system yet.

On the other hand, the lack of ability to use it as a standalone headset might kill it because I certainly wouldn't want to enjoy movies while sitting by my computer. I want to lie down comfortably or use it on-the-go, like on an airplane. That's where it's form-factor really shines.

If only it has wifi and supports VD...>>><<<The fov of bigscreen headset is not big. Lol>>><<<What's with all the hate? It's a nice breath of fresh-air for PCVR headsets, the standalone's are great but there is just no love for PCVR focus only>>><<<There are massive issues here with this HMD.  Fixed IPD.  You can't buy a fully functioning HMD directly from this company.  You have to buy a large part of the kit from Valve.  This is insanity.  Do you understand how hard it has been to buy base stations from Valve over the last few years?  Valve is going to transfer manufacturing for base stations to HTC in the near future.>>><<<Not really the most scientific test, but I just checked Steam and base stations are in-stock>>><<<We understand your concern about the fixed IPD - but please note the IPD will be fixed to **your** IPD. This makes it harder to share, but does mean it's perfect for you specifically.

Availability of the base stations on Steam has actually been quite good the past 6-12 months.>>><<<Awesome to see a dev in the thread, I'm extremely excited for this headset! How many total preorders will you be accepting? I want to preorder this in 2-3 months, do you estimate you'd still have spots available on the preorder list?>>><<<Base stations have been in stock for many months now.>>><<<People need to chill about fov... If you don't like it , just buy something else... I'm sure it may work for some given the small form factor... That's the tradeoff... Not everyone is willing to have an hmd the size of a shoe box like the 8kx or even the crystal.>>><<<You bring up a very strange concept...buy what you need and works for you. It's a bit radical, but I think I get what you mean lol.

That said I don't like the FOV however I almost don't care because of the virtues of the small light headset. I don't need one of these and I put EXTREME importance on FOV and refresh rate, but I may still buy one of these just for watching movies and stuff like that. I already do that and have since I started heavy into VR back in 2016, but this is fascinating. I'd almost buy it purely so it has a chance to live and develop. 🤔>>><<<It's crazy how small headsets have been getting.>>><<<And the FOV>>><<<FOV isnt great but it's not the only thing that matters in a headset. Or do you only use your pimax 5k and nothing else?>>><<<Interesting, but not a complete winner for me. Micro OLED and displayport, yes! Custom fit, yes! Weight, awesome! FOV, meh, although the Pico showed me that size of sweet spot makes smaller FOV feel less constricting, but 90 is just too low. If it had PICO sized FOV it would be more appealing. The TESTED review mentioned glare, which sounds like the PICO pancake lens glare and can be annoying. SteamVR tracking is cool but I would have liked some inside out for ease of use.>>><<<I see the use Case for this. But not for the price.>>><<<Yea, it is aimed at a very specific audience.

I think it could do well if they understand that small but loyal market.>>><<<Well, quite an interesting headset for enthusiasts, which would be a no brainer for me if not for the FOV and the high price tag. 

I somehow feel like the VR hardware producing companies do not really get what the VR market needs, besides more/better games (imho): More HMDs at an affordable price for casual gamers. Right now we only got the Quest 2 and the upcoming 3, the Pico and we might include the PSVR2 (in case one already owns a PS5). For any other HMD, the price is too high for casuals to step into the VR world. 

If we had more variance in the lower price segment (and, as said above, more interesting games within the AA/AAA-league) probably more people would give it a try. Do we need another niche-going headset to grow the market? I don't think so, at least not at this point...maybe later, when more gamers are "bound" to the VR-ecosystem. So why do companies through so many enthusiast-hardware on the market instead of starting it slowly but steady?

I own the Rift S, the Index, the Pico and will for sure buy the next "best allrounder"-headset for PCVR (hoping for the Index 2). But by far not everyone is willing to put so much money in VR...

Just my 2 cents...>>><<<Lack of wireless - shame. Collab with nofio could have been cool!

90 FOV is unacceptable at this price point.>>><<<This looks fucking rad. PPD, clarity and comfort are my top priorities and this looks like it will nail them all. 

Fingers crossed for success.>>><<<You have my attention....>>><<<I have to honestly say, I'm glad I haven't bought an XR Elite yet because this looks like a viable competitor in my book against it.  


I'm going to wait for the real world reviews and see what the real world FOV is.  


Then, if Nofio is able to make this wireless as well... damn... this might be the last headset I buy for a very long time. We'll see.>>><<<This has certainly piqued my interest.

I'm currently using a G2 so I need to buy base stations and controllers, but for the Form factor, resolution and extreme lightweight the $1500 price doesn't seem that bad for PC-focused enthusiast hardware.

I never share around my headset but I can't say the "Generic" adjustable optics and face cushion have ever bothered me before though I guess making them bespoke like that makes the headsets simpler to manufacture (fewer moving parts) and in a way cheaper?

I don't think I will be in the first batch of orders but if the final reviews are good I can see this being my next headset.

Regardless more PCVR headsets and more SteamVR headsets is always good news even if you are not nessisarly the target demographic>>><<<Why on earth did they not include a generic facial interface as well as the custom? 

It's such a weird HMD, "can it be used on the couch to watch movies with 3dof?" (Literally the entire point of the company) "um, i don't know if it can or not?" What now? How can that not be a definite feature?>>><<<90 degree FOV - No thank you.Too bad, the rest sounds pretty awesome.But Im done with looking through a scuba-mask.

New VR must be 140 horisontal FOV or it is a no go.Seem like Pimax is the only option so far. And I hate their hammerhead form.>>><<<This..   Definitely has some appeal.  Seeing the pictures of it next to a Quest 2 is like “Oh crap, I didn’t realize how big a Quest 2 is”.  

I’m trying to get into VR dev, a much smaller PCVR headset is appealing to me for that (vs putting giant headsets on and off).  

And just in general….  It looks like it beats the picture of a lot of headsets.   The custom fit is appealing.  The size is appealing.>>><<<Seems pretty overpriced for what you get, or don't get, actually.>>><<<90 degree field of view and no inside-out tracking. And $1000. DOA.>>><<<This is like something from a random booth at CES for some niche device they are releasing only in China - except it's not.>>><<<1000$ headset with no face/eye tracking, no controllers or lighthouses, 90 degree fov, no on board audio, and requiring a specially made face gasket that you need to send a random company a faceID scan of your face for (if you even have an iphone in the first place)?

I'm sure there are a few people out there that will fit the criteria for this headset but that's an insane ask for someone who doesn't already have an index to scavenge the tracking from.>>><<<Kudos for the advancement of technology in this small of a form factor, decent features, but will be dead in the water *for me*, at least.

- Don't have an iPhone, so I can't scan my face. Can be solved by finding a friend with one, but still.

- No IPD Adjustment means it can only ever be for you, so the joy of sharing it with your friends is null, plus your face shape being what it's built for. Still cool if you have the money to splurge, but for me I enjoy sharing VR with people too much to lock down an expensive device to just me, especially if I want to sell it a few years down the line.

- No controllers. Extra cost then unless you're already in the ecosystem.

- Base station only. Undeniably the most accurate tracking method, but poses additional cost and requirements/restrictions.

- No option for wireless. Would be nice to have an additional strap module that could strap to the back/plug in to that same USB port on the side that has an onboard chipset for wireless streaming with an integrated battery, as I'll admit I'm a prude for being able to ditch the wire when playing.

Overall impressive, and those of us that do get this are gonna be ecstatic, but it's gonna be a hard sell for the majority of VR users, I think. Might be the perfect headset for game devs that wear a headset for most of the day, every day, and want something tethered and always just on their forehead and ready to go.>>><<<Yeah its SUPER niche but I can see its use case 

price - PCVR is my main hobby so I don't mind splurging since I don't spend heavily elsewhere anyway

no iphone - my friend has one, not a huge deal for me

ipd issue - i already have an index and vive og, so I already have other things for people to play with

no controllers - i have 2 sets of index controllers already for the above

no base stations - already have 2 sets of basestations set up in 2 rooms for the above

no wireless - i've yet to try an inside out device that matches the tracking fidelity of lighthouse tech (used wmr/quest 2, heard good things about quest pro but havent personally tried) and I've used wired since vive og so at this point I come to deal with it



and yeah like you mentioned I make mods in unreal engine and testing them out and having to put on / take off / peak thru it by lifting slightly gets annoying. something more lightweight would be nicer

really my only true downside for me would bt the fov. I personally find a higher fov more immersive than a higher resolution because you see more of the world/enviornment. sde isn't really that big of a deal for me when Im immersed anyway tbh. But for things like using it at a desk or watching movies you wouldn't really need the full scope of the scene anyway. 

Id def like to try it out first hand tho to make a real judgement>>><<<A lot of the comments are missing the point: this is a luxury VR device for people with a lot of money who want to absolute lightest / most comfortable VR headset for casual use.>>><<<You should consider providing a few generic cushions for those that don't want or can't provide a face scan. It's probably the same fabrication process and you can just average a few generic ranges. Bonus points if people could try them on in the store.>>><<<If Nofio is able to make it wireless, I might seriously consider this.

Edit: lol, downvoted for saying my own personal opinion? What is wrong with some of you people?>>><<<Spending a lot of money in hardware not made by a big company is a risky business, unless your income is so much, you find the expense small. It seems a cool gadget though.>>><<<Thanks for your in-depth write up as well as the comparison to every *other* headset.

Will I feel a major downgrade from the Valve Index? I am looking into affordable wireless options.>>><<<Definitely wont feel a downgrade besides the compression and some games controls might not work or be set up.>>><<<I felt a downgrade in FOV and significantly worse audio(expected). 

Personally I was looking to replace the index but this didn't quite make the cut. Also the controllers have a vibration tracking issue which I'm hoping iss to be sorted in 5.2>>><<<I bought Pico 4 and sold Valve Index because I have no space in my PC room to play with wired headset. So I found myself not using it at all.

This is the truth: Index is better in every aspect, Pico 4 only has better resolution and lenses. 

But I will tell you that Index makes up for this with better colors and contrast. I tried them side by side and Index was visualy way better. You can not even see real resolution in Pico 4 (VD has compresion, native games can not run at full resolution).

If Valve only upgraded resolution and add pancake  lenses in the same form factor.. Index would still be the best VR headset in years to come. If Nofio releases low latency wireless adapter for Index all problems would be solved.>>><<<One more thing. Index is far better headset and Pico 4 is not IT!

If you have no headset get Pico for a year or two and wait for next generation from Valve.

If you already have Index and space to move with it, don' t even dare to think about switching. 😀 I did it because I had to.>>><<<I did just that. Index is better in many ways:

- much brighter
- really better colors
- more comfortable
- better audio
- slightly better FOV
- latency is really noticable in virtual desktop with Pico (I have wi-fi 6 router and 4090 gpu, so I can really push virtual desktop).

I still decided to make a trade due to Pico' s ease of use. It is light, wireless and ready to rock n roll.

Index is lacking wireless mode (for now Nofio is coming soon) and I really hate resolution on Index - it is really old by now.>>><<<What about the tracking? The base station tracking is really accurate when it comes to quick snaps.>>><<<Yes it is better I guess, but both work fine so I never even thought about it.>>><<<I've also had just about every headset released and I agree with many of your points. However, the brightness I was surprised to find a non issue on mine at least. I wonder if there is variance, because I didn't find it any worse than the quest 2, rift cv1, and better than pimax 5k+ and 8k. The reverb g2 and index are both better however. Did you turn up the brightness to full in the pico menu? Also, there's a noticeable uptick in clarity compared to a quest 2 for example, not quite g2 because of the compression, but it's still the best wireless vr headset out I think. I also haven't noticed anything like the plane turning you're describing.>>><<<I think there must be some variances as my Pico very clearly had deeper blacks, much more vibrant colours *and* was every bit as bright as my Quest 2, even with the Pico on 75% brightness.>>><<<&gt; I think there must be some variances

At this point I honestly think there is a serious problem with the quality control for the Pico 4. The individual perception obviously plays an important role as well, but the discrepancy I've seen so far between "not as good as the Quest 2" (smaller sweet spot compared to the Q2(!), no difference in FOV, brightness too low, bad colours...) and "noticeable better than the Quest 2" (huge sweet spot, noticeable bigger FOV, decent brightness and colours...) seems to be a bit too big for me. 🤔>>><<<The SDE you describe is more visible *because* the lenses are so sharp.  And like other posters mentioned when you tighten it up (and yes there's ways to soften that facial interface so it isn't punishment) you get pretty much crystal clear clarity from edge to edge and a *huge* difference in FOV from a Q2.

And brightness is lower - but maybe this is exaggerated because you admittedly wear Vr headsets without the gaskets on.     


Pico 4's already a great contender with the Quest 2, and it literally just came out.  A few software updates and revisions and this is going to be a solid pick for new VR users.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Wash it repeatedly with soap and water, crush the materials in your hands, and general use. Its made of foam, foam breaks down/compresses with use. Im sure youve sat in an old sofa or two>>><<<You didn't see the same edge-to-edge clarity as everyone else because you weren't tightening the headstrap enough.  As you noticed when you took out the facepad, your eyes have to be closer to the lenses to see through them properly.

The problem is that the facepad is so terrible that tightening the strap properly is literally painful.  Aftermarket replacement options can't happen fast enough for this.>>><<<Problem is, I would consider the edge to edge clarity on par with Oculus and Valve (the only headsets with relatively high edge to edge clarity). I was expecting more. But, then again, I am also spoiled by Nreal Air. Actual edge to edge clarity.>>><<<I have one too, as well as Quests 1 and 2.  The resolution and clarity are far superior to the Quests.  If you aren't seeing that, embrace the face pain and tighten the strap more.>>><<<I don't use the facial interface. I never do on any headset I own, because they all lower FOV. I have the lenses as close as possible. Like my eye lashes touching. Maybe I need to do 'A' 'B' comparisons. But, just based off what I remember. I don't find it particularly meaningful. I still have to turn my head to read the windows clock clearly.>>><<<“I’m not using the product as intended! Why isn’t it working as advertised?”>>><<<oh ok so you're just an idiot, ok i got you!>>><<<Why?>>><<<I've just ordered pico4 yesterday and now wondering if I'll get any fov improvements compared to Quest2, considering I'm using it with glasses so can't really get my eyes much closer to lenses..>>><<<It does have better FOV, but not a giant leap forward, even with the glasses spacer.  The biggest difference is the increased resolution and edge-to-edge clarity of the new lenses.>>><<<Wondering if I will see the edge-to-edge clarity if my glasses prevent me from tightening the headstrap enough..>>><<<It's not your glasses that'll prevent that, it's the pain from the terrible facepad.>>><<<Gotcha>>><<<Thanks for the feedback, as a Quest 2 owner I am interested to read it. How are black levels vs Quest 2? Everyone forgets to mention black levels. :(>>><<<They're a little better than Quest 2, worse than Quest 1.  They aren't OLEDs or even micro LCDs, so no miracles happening in this regard.>>><<<I would say the black levels are quite good, better than q2 and index>>><<<No one mentions them because they are LCD screens. Pretty much they are all the same, unless they are firmware tweaked. Nothing special about the Pico 4 LCD screens. Next to an OLED, they would compare just as you imagine.>>><<<&gt;No one mentions them because they are LCD screens. Pretty much they are all the same,

That is not true, different types have significant variances.>>><<<That’s definitely not true.  Quest 2 and Reverb G2 are both LCD but are hugely different in colors and black level.>>><<<Question: I'm looking to buy either a Pico 4, Quest Pro or the Nreal Air solely for media consumption (YouTube videos, movies, web browsing) How big is the virtual screen of the Nreal Air in comparison to the VR headsets? I currently use my Quest 2 to watch content in the Bigscreen Beta app and it feels like I'm watching movies on a huge 200 inch screen inside a theater. Also, since the Pico 4 has a 4k screen resolution does the Pico 4 look crisper and more detailed in comparison to the Nreal's 1080p resolution in regards to movie watching regarding clarity?>>><<<Look up the ppd numbers of pico 4 vs nreal air. It seems nreal air is what you are looking for.>>><<<And by not buying it you also get to not support a genocidal regime.>>><<<lol ok buddy>>><<<Meta is literally not any better.>>><<<&gt; FOV Taking off the facial interface nets you like 20+ degrees fov. And the closer your eyes are to the screen, the clearer everything is, including the edges. It's a huge difference.

Can't wait for a better facial interface that has less plastic so you're closer to the lenses>>><<<What’s the max fov you get with your method?>>><<<It's weird how on other reviews people are turning the brightness down and some are saying it's too dark :D

Vr headsets are pretty personal experience>>><<<This is a thorough analysis. I appreciate you bringing up the [Nreal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/) glasses.>>><<<it's just like pico 4 but with eye and face tracking (if you're using streaming assistant you need to download vrcfacetracking in order for all that tracking to work, don't know if it's the same case with virtual desktop)>>><<<also if you live in the US, there is almost no point in buying pico, since it's very hard to get there>>><<<You can get it via AliExpress or ebay just as easy as elsewhere.>>><<<I don't think so, you can buy it online>>><<<didn't know that, I only remember pico spreading only in EU, but haven't heard any news about US>>><<<Get the quest 3 if your gonna pay that much>>><<<Quest3 doesn't have eye tracking.>>><<<What apps are you gonna use with eye tracking? Pico eye tracking doesn't work on PC. They haven't even released an SDK for it to help development.>>><<<It think it works, i have seen some videos of it working.

https://twitter.com/ChuntaJim/status/1655160953636532224>>><<<With PCVR or with standalone apps?>>><<<Then get a Quest Pro.>>><<<?????>>><<<Okay shill>>><<<but its much expensive than q3 or p4 pro>>><<<Only if you have to buy it for its $1000 retail price. Many retailers sell it for even less because well, how many people are buying it these days for $1000? It wasn't a hot product even before Quest 3 was out. Stock clearance.

If you go marketplaces, it's even lower new. If you go used (barely used in many cases), even lower still, less than Quest 3.

Just get a Quest Pro. If Quest Pro is niche, how niche do you think Pico 4 Pro will be for proper support for its eye tracking in PCVR games, etc? Hardware can't be separated from software. How many people on this subreddit have it? Probably 3.>>><<<More powerful soc &gt; eye tracking.

Unless you have a specific use case like primarily playing social vr or only plan to play pcvr with foveated rendering>>><<<well am gonna use it for vr chat cuz am tired of changing faces with touching buttons>>><<<~~Dont get the pro version, Pico have separated the store to regular consumer one with games and professional with barely anything on it. I have pico 3 pro and recently lost access to virtual desktop app as its not available on business store after the firmware update. Only way to fix it is to flash a non-pro firmware and loose pro features (not sure what's the difference between regular pico4 and pro one, maybe there is no pro features)~~

edit: nevermind, pico 3 pro = enterprise, with no access to normal store and pico 4 pro = consumer with normal store. PICO f up with naming real bad>>><<<Pico 4 pro is NOT enterprise
Stop mixing them up
Pico 3 pro is enterprise headset but pico 4 pro is consumer one
It has regular store>>><<<Really? That's stupid. Pico did such a shit job marketing their headsets and naming them lol>>><<<Yeah there is pico 4 enterprise and it’s just called pico 4 enterprise and it has silver cover not gold one>>><<<I've tried it and love it, BUT, I wouldn't recommend it to most people. First off, it's only sold in China. Therefore, you'll have to go through the entire process of switching the software region. It isn't too hard and just requires a computer, but it is tedious. Second, very few games support eye and face tracking in standalone mode (Vrchat doesn't which is the main one I'd imagine it's useful in). They will work with most games via a leaked beta version of Pico's desktop app, but that kinda defeats the point of the headset lmao. It's a wonderful device with a lot of potential, but at the moment I don't think it's worth it for most people. You get full access to all the games the normal pico 4 would have of course, so it is still a headset that I'm getting a ton of use out of, just not one I'm really recommending.>>><<<oh actually I don't care about standalone games, am almost playing pcvr and heard that vd has been started to supporting facial tracking recently too.>>><<<Ooo interesting, I've heard that vd on pico is just a port of the quest version but that must not be the case if it's supporting facial tracking. I'd assume that more games would get native face tracking support for it too as time goes on, seeing that it isn't an enterprise headset like most face tracking ones are>>><<<what I'm most concerning about is its display as heard that it is worse than q3, which I'm using now. but am tired of changing faces by touching buttons on vr chat>>><<<For vr chat, I think your best option would be a vive headset with a facial tracker attached. The hp reverb g2 omnicept edition also has face and eye tracking natively supported by vr chat, but it's generally only available on eBay and whatnot as it's technically a business device.>>><<<yea I know vive pro eye has the best tracking but it's out of my budget>>><<<The pico 4 pro may be your best option then, but I'm hesitant to recommend it as native support on PC apps for it's facial tracking is still limited. Technically you can't even activate face tracking in Pico's pc app on any of the official publicly available versions, only on a leaked beta version (which does work but still something to note)>>><<<This was cool to see the different types along with their pricing

Flight Unlimited was one of the few games that supported it and that was hurl inducing.  You could only okay it for a few minutes at a time.

It was definately ahead of its time, but the concept also needed to be more greatly understood.>>><<<[Here's an old site](https://web.archive.org/web/20220216091847/http://stereo3d.com/3dhome.htm) with a ton of info on all kinds of classic VR / stereoscopic equipment and software.

It would be awesome if someone found a way to emulate classic VR games on modern hardware/operating systems.>>><<<Any titles in particular you are thinking of? My limited experience was with a 2005 eMagin. Trying to get flatscreen games to work in VR. I don't remember many titles having proper support or being exclusive VR experiences.>>><<<The one that comes to my mind is [Locus (1995)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/locus). I know the game wasn't very well-received in its time but it's what kick-started my interest in VR as a kid.

I know Descent was VR-compatible, but you can actually run it in VR on modern systems with D2X-XL and VorpX.

I'm fairly certain there were a few VR-compatible flight simulators and racing games, too.>>><<<It's amazing the extent of what they talk about in the video actually resembles the VR landscape of today. Although when they showed that VR flight sim game running at 2-3 FPS I was horrified.>>><<<They skipped one of the biggest leaps, the Virtuality system. Granted, it wasn't consumer, but that was due to how far ahead the technology really was.

I played on a few at the Trocadero Center in London. Awe inspiring!>>><<<Dactyl Nightmare FTW!!! My first taste of VR.>>><<<Same! Straight after Alien War! What a day that was. Ridge Racer in a full sized Mazda, After Burner R360...

I also played the mech Virtuality Game in a pod. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to young-teenage me, I have a slight astigmatism that made Virtuality unplayable for me. Luckily it mostly self-corrected, I've had no issues as an adult, I love getting stuck in on my Quest.>>><<<And the Victor Maxx, which was multi platform with a vga input. Though honestly it was hardly VR by todays standards, just a screen strapped to your face lol>>><<<The [Cybermaxx by Victormaxx](http://videogamekraken.com/cybermaxx-by-victormaxx) was actually a decent headset for the time. I had one from about 1995-2009 when it finally broke irreparably and I decided to toss it. Granted, it only saw any kind of regular use for the first few years of that. It was very finnicky to set up, but with stereoscopic vision and 6dof (rotational, but no positional tracking), it was pretty impressive for the day. Quake 1 was my jam thanks to the Mousemaxx driver that let you use the headset's tracking for mouselook.

Sometimes I could go 10s of minutes without getting a headache!>>><<<same with the Virtual Boy. it was stereoscopic 3d, not virtual.>>><<<Modern VR headsets are also stereoscopic. How did you think their 3D worked?

There's also listings for a whole bunch of AR devices on there too, and don't tell anyone just yet, but I've started work on an update to get listings for peripherals and accessories as well :)

I'd be happy to have a go at generating graphics like this post with more devices at some point as well. Let me know if that's something you think would be cool to see.>>><<<There are images of the psvr2 out now btw>>><<<I can’t wait until next gen Index with higher resolution.

I am happy with my Index but can’t help comparing the blacks to my iPhone 12’s AMOLED screen.>>><<<Yes. That combined with at least 140° FOV would be my sweet spot.>>><<<Oh yeah. 100% agree with that!!>>><<<While I agree 100%, I think there's a very high possibility that instead of releasing a revamped index with a higher resolution, they're completely redesigning it to include next gen features like micro OLED, eye tracked foveated rendering, onboard x64 computing, and wireless PCVR.  Unfortunately, all this new tech means it will take longer to release.>>><<<Waiting for a thing that may never exist is not something one should do.>>><<<Why in the world might it never exist? Current index sales are doing great seemingly since they are like always selling out or accessories selling out. And regardless, if there was no Index 2 there would be SOME successor, doesn’t have to specifically be by Valve.>>><<<It might never exist because Valve does whatever happens to interest them at the moment, and that may not be VR.

There are already other better headsets from companies other than Valve. Your post was about an Index 2, which may never exist.>>><<<What would be a better alternative for PC VR versus the index? I'm looking for an upgrade to the OG vive.>>><<<The Reverb G2 for highest pixel density. 

Though I am partial to wireless pcvr with my Q2, and I have yet to hear of someone disappointed going from the vive to the Q2. Wireless+no more screendoor is a nice upgrade.>>><<<Quest  2, hands-down. Much higher resolution screen, lighter, can be used wirelessly with Airlink or wired if you’re into that. I currently own seven headsets and the Quest 2 is the best one I’ve had so far, it gets about as much use as my index.>>><<<But there’s really not. Index is the best all arounder right now. There’s headsets with better resolution that are lacking in other areas.>>><<<Agreed.>>><<<I had no idea there were so many different headsets in just the last two years.  Are any of them worth considering over the Index or Quest 2?>>><<<Most of them aren't even released, already discontinued, business-only or China-only. The only ones worth considering over an Index are HP Reverb G2, Pimax, Vive Pro 2 and Varjo Aero. 

Pico Neo 3 is the Chinese Quest2 equivalent and might be worth a look in some business situations due to not needing Facebook.>>><<<No.  They are either infinitely more expensive or worse experiences.  Until the PSVR2 comes out the choice for 99% of people is Index or Quest 2.>>><<<Is facebook/meta still a requirement for the Quest 2?>>><<<Yes, but rumors are that goes away in a few months.  Also all the people getting their accounts revoked for not having an active Facebook account have stopped.  Personally I was very against the link but I broke down just this week and got a Quest 2.  Very impressive tech!  Worth it for all the game options.>>><<<Well I can wait a few months. Thanks for answering.>>><<<I have both and only ever use the Quest 2, even for PCVR. It's wireless and doesn't require you to set up any base stations. The compression is sometimes obvious but not very often, and it's running at a higher resolution than the Index anyway so I wouldn't say it looks worse.>>><<<The field of view is a BIG difference for me (plus the frame rate).  I still use both (just got my Quest 2 last week) but I definitely feel like the Quest 2 is more like playing on console and the Index is like playing on PC.>>><<<Is there a way to make the index wireless like the vive+wigig?>>><<<Not that I know of, but if you want wireless then the Quest 2 is the way to go.  Having such a high resolution and frame rate makes wireless very difficult.>>><<<Reverb G2 is much better than either of those in terms of raw clarity.>>><<<The G2 is so underrated imo>>><<<I almost feel spoiled, the clarity and brightness is so good compared to other HDMs on the market. Just wish it had better controllers and a wider FOV.>>><<<Agreed, I play sims so don’t mind the controllers. FOV I made a little better with a thinner face gasket.>>><<<&gt;Reverb G2 is much better than either of those in terms of raw clarity.

The go to porn machine.>>><<<I've tried just about all of them and the only two I'd recommend are the reverb g2 (reasonably priced) and the varjo xr3 /vr3/aero (not reasonably priced)>>><<<If you care more about FoV than refresh rate, Pimax instead of Index.>>><<<Don't forget the Vive Pro 2,
Buy from somewhere when you don't have to deal with HTC Support (Buy off Amazon or something)

I found myself liking the VP2 over the Index.
It's pricey, but still runs the Valve Knuckles if you wish so you don't have to compromise to go VP2 over Index.>>><<<Sure, if you already have index controllers, the VP2 might be a good upgrade, but the vp2 controllers are a hard sell.  They seemed kind of outdated shortly after they initially released with the first vive.  The vive focus 3 doesn't use them.  Having said that they're still probably the best controllers for beat saber.  Also, the vp2 microphone is just bad.  You might not hear it, unless you're doing recording, but if you play multiplayer, everyone else will be able to hear it.>>><<<Definitely, don't bother with vive wands!
Buy the standalone VP2 headset and Knuckles &amp; Base station package from steam or somewhere.
The wands are outdated but HTC pretty much said "why would we spend tons on R&amp;D for an expensive controller when you guys already have the knuckles">>><<<Good point. VP2 has a bit higher res than the Index. 

Regardless of those 3, the Index/Knuckles controllers are definitely the choice.>>><<<VP2 is \*dramatically\* sharper and clearer than Index and has much higher resolution. Having said that its far from perfect as even on my replacement unit lenses are usable but meh with the god rays and glare. Index has a very clear screen door present, triply so on anything bright. But it feels well-made and has the least software issues.

Furthermore, vive motion smoothing is a sad joke, whereas Index had a real, reliable solution.>>><<<That's more like if you care about fov on paper over literally everything about the experience, pimax. Terrible warping, no/shitty sound, bad ergonomics, bad lenses, worse screens, terrible support, shit tier software, still have to buy controllers and base stations... etc. Not a fan.>>><<<Have you ever used one?

The warping is only at the edge so for 95% of the screen it is still more than other headset FoVs. The DAS has perfectly fine audio. What ergonomics? The DAS fits exactly like a Vive Pro. The lenses/screens are both fine. You would actually have a point about their support before they started their US support team. The software is no more shitty than Oculus or Vive since you really only care about a few settings. If you are talking about the old software, absolutely, but for the last 2 years or so it hasn't been an issue. You still have to buy controllers and base stations with the others...

If you have used one, you must have used it like a few months after they started shipping units because within that first year they made a US support team and improved the software significantly.>>><<<Definitely a few I see missing from around '95. The virtuality? I clearly remember playing ROTT and a few other games on it in a gaming cafe (that was a decade ahead of its time and stupidly expensive).>>><<<Yep, I remember this. It was powered by a Commodore Amiga and you stood in a circle thing with guard rails.>>><<<Why is DecaGear on "yet-to-be-released"? It got cancelled, did it not?>>><<<This graphic isn't completely up to date or complete.>>><<<Where does it say it has been cancelled?>>><<<Go on their website. It was canceled and they became some kind of bullshit nft or crypto crap company.>>><<<What a complete joke of a company. I gave them 10 bucks for the preorder as somewhat of a "hail mary" and forgot about this headset in hopes that it wasnt a scam. Seems like everything was way too good to be true.>>><<<Such a shame the big manufacturers got out of this space>>><<<There are a lot of headsets here, but there is also a huge amount missing as well - particularly from the 80’s and 90’s>>><<<Actually disappointed, none of the vr systems of the late 80's(?) are there..

An arcade booth style vr setup called virtuality I think was a product businesses bought AFAIK. I wanna see the early working prototype stuff on here too though. Vr is so much older then people give credit for.>>><<<Holy fuck, the price of that Canon headset at the very bottom is jaw dropping>>><<<Project Cambria is probably the most anticipated upcoming hmd. Granted, we dont know the final name.>>><<<and PS VR2>>><<<Have you seen this video?  https://youtu.be/6jpPj7bldUY. It outlines what the Cambria will be like.  It's not really doing anything that other companies aren't doing.  It even has the same processor as the Quest 2.  But it's a good collection of current available technologies.  Full color passthrough,  controllers with cameras that can track themselves, mini-led screens, pancake lenses, a decent strap, face and eye tracking, and eye tracked dynamic foveated rendering.  The foveated rendering in particular is something I expect almost all new headsets to have going forward.

People will be excited for it because it's from Meta, but it's really marketed toward business, and there will be better headsets in the near future.>>><<<Full color passthrough is the most interesting feature. Quest 2 is great but the fuzzy B&amp;W passthrough is fugly>>><<<I think the biggest reason why it's something else is the form factor. At this point, the form factor starts to be a big thing. We'll see if the release version is as small as promised.

Too bad the uOLED doesn't seem to be likely anymore. Probably too low FoV or whatever. I'm not sure whether I personally waited for anything else than these two pointers. Controllers that work behind your back is cool I guess, but let's be real, that's useful only rarely.

Well OK, a proper fovated dynamic rendering would be a huge thing. The competition at the moment have like this kind-of-dynamic rendering, where the area of max detail is quite large due to the eye tracking still being so poor.>>><<<&gt;Too bad the uOLED doesn't seem to be likely anymore. Probably too low FoV or whatever.

The FoV of the Cambria will be very close to the Quest 2, which isn't very wide, so it's probably not that.  The more likely reasons for going with mini-LED over uOLED is either brightness, cost, or availability.  In particular, the pancake lenses it will be using need a higher brightness value, and higher brightness is something that companies have been really struggling to accomplish using uOLED.  


Of course, the pancake lenses also make a much better weight profile, because screen, and everything else, can be much closer to the lenses.  The greater comfort from that could be a very compelling reason for people.  Additionally, the lack of god rays.   


But one thing I just remembered, is that the Cambria will likely be using a very similar cooling profile as the Focus 3 (because greater cooling allows much more performance from the XR2 SOC), and one of the biggest complaints about the Focus 3 was the noise from the fans.  It will be interesting to see if Oculus can succeed in significantly reducing their cooling noise.>>><<<I am curious what your definitions are both for "better headsets" and "near future" are in this context. Genuinely so, because as a quest 2 owner the Cambria sounds compelling for my next standalone, but without an upgraded chipset (though with a boost to the XR2 as I understand), I'm having a hard time justifying the increased price for just rumoured improvements. I really like my quest 2 and it's freedom, but the FOV and rapidly aging power are the biggest detractors for me.

The way I'm seeing it with the current information is I'm only buying Cambria if the color passthrough and improvements let me use this with my PC wirelessly and seamlessly replacing my monitors but giving me a non-gimmicky mixed reality setting without eyestrain due to poor visuals in which to do my work. Of course this is what was teased in that leaked teaser video and what has me most intrigued, but for sure it's not confirmed. That alone might be worth upgrading from my quest, but just for the "slight" improvements (my own emphasis) in gaming it's a no go. So what actually will be "better" and "soon"?>>><<<Better meaning micro oled, wider fov, better risc SOCs, better x64 APUs,  possibly lower cost.  Near future in this case just means within the next 2 years, maybe 3.  New risc SOCs next year, (XR3 is expected late 2023, and Meta is also working with Qualcomm on one tailored for VR) , and some better standalone devices will be built on those.  Valve is likely working on an x64 VR device with a similar APU to the one that's in the Steam Deck, but they may be waiting for a generational upgrade to make that feasible.  Micro oled is likely going to be a major player in new headsets, but the tech's just not ready yet, but it should be soon.  


The FOV on Cambria is probably going to be a bit better than Quest 2, but not significantly so.  As for the diminishing battery life, there's really  no way around that unless they have a user swappable battery.  The focus 3 has a user swappable battery in the back of the headset strap, and so does the upcoming Pimax 12k.  I haven't seen any news on Cambria, about the battery.  


With my Quest 2, I have a battery velcro strapped to the back of my head strap, and I plug it in when I see that my headset's battery is at 40% or less.  If, in the future, that's still not enough, I can just buy a better external battery.  


The Cambria is going to be quite a bit more expensive than the Q2.  The more I think about it, though, the more compelling the Cambria is because of the full color mixed reality, the pancake lenses, the mini-led screens, the eye tracked dynamic foveated rendering, and the on-board camera tracked controllers, but reception and adoption will depend upon the final price and whether they have worked out kinks like fan noise and visual clarity.  I doubt it will be the same sort of seismic shift that the Q2 has been.  


The Varjo XR-3 has incredible mixed reality now, but it's tremendously expensive.   Lynx R1 has full color mixed reality, and is supposed to start delivering this June (June!!!), but I haven't heard much about it recently.  The Pimax 12k QLED is supposed to come out by the end of the year, and it is supposed to have an MR module, but it's projected to cost $2400, and it's still a mystery if they will be able to deliver on all of their promises.  It also uses the XR-2 so could have the same problems with fan noise as the Cambria could have.  I'm most excited for the next Valve headset, but I could be waiting a very long time for that.  Apple's headset is rumored to be coming sometime, but I don't know when.  PSVR 2 is coming soon, which will probably be great for gaming, but will be wired, and probably restricted to the ps5 ecosystem.  Also, there's a very good possibility that Meta is already working on Cambria 2(Quest 2 released about 1.5 years after Quest 1), as well as the Quest 3.     


A lot of the information that is out now is speculative, so it's hard to be able to know a lot of things with certainty.  In general, I expect there to be an explosion of next generation headsets in 2024.>>><<<All good information, thank you. And more or less what I figured on the timeline, but I was hoping otherwise. I'm looking at upgrading my workstation very soon (definitely before 2024), and a new headset is in the cards IF it fit the mixed reality bill. Guess I'll just have to wait and see on the Cambria.>>><<<Lynx R1 will be out before Cambria, but it seems they have some supply problems with one of their cameras, so it might not be available to everyone until later.  They have enough for all the Kickstarter units plus about 200.  We'll just have to wait and see if they can solve the supply problem before Cambria releases.  And, of course, wait for reviews to see if it's worth it.>>><<<Oh absolutely. There's no way I'd buy it without units being out in the wild and reviewed. It wasn't really even on my radar though, I'll have to look into it, thanks!>>><<<Half dive ended is it true?>>><<<They went back to the drawing board afaik>>><<<in what universe did the oculus rift S release AFTER the valve index ??

I bought the oculus rift S and used it for a year or so before I ordered day 1 the valve index... so that doesn't make sense to me.

most of the modern VR is a further iteration on the tech until it was actually ready for the consumer market. the OG Rift and Vive were really the first. 

the Rift was significantly more primitive on launch, they had envisioned it as a headset for Sim type games. but then the Vive dropped with room tracking and motion controls and the Rift had to catch up. the early Rift motion controllers relied on a system of cameras that had to be set up. 

now Oculus is ruling the roost with the Quest 2. they've sold the shit out of em, the inside out tracking has shown to be more than adequate (personally i still prefer outside in tracking), but they're making some real headway when it comes to bringing VR to the masses.>>><<<The Touch controllers were planned before the Vive was released. I pre-ordered the Rift CV1 knowing full well I was in for another $200 when the controllers were ready. 

Also, it did room scale just fine. I never heard complaints from CV1 owners about it, and I would have been one of the ones complaining if I were unable to play a whole host of room scale games.

Initial tests were with the default two cameras placed diagonally, which some people got to work. But Oculus realized it really needed three cameras, so you could buy extra cameras for $59. Some people even went for four, which most of us thought was overkill. 

Neither headset was "significantly more primitive" than the other, and the Great Fanboy Wars over whose magical teleportation device was better than whose became more important to too many people than the shared experience of a whole new medium.

And unfortunately, they continue in some form to this day.>>><<<And that's not counting early prototypes in the 60s (Sword of Damocles) and the first commercial push in the 80's (VPL).>>><<<So I really haven't been keeping track of hardware very much.

**[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_\(virtual_reality\))** 
 
 &gt;The Sword of Damocles was the name for the mechanical tracking system and not the head-mounted display, and is widely considered to be the first augmented reality HMD system, although Morton Heilig had already created a similar apparatus (known as "Stereoscopic-Television Apparatus for Individual Use" or "Telesphere Mask") earlier, patented in 1960. The Sword of Damocles was created in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland with the help of his students Bob Sproull, Quintin Foster, and Danny Cohen.

\[Edit: OK, whoever downvoted me - care to explain how it's VR? If Virtual Boy was VR, then so was 1980's Battlezone arcade game, which was also a vector-based game in which you peered through stationary goggles. It also had no head tracking at all. Is your definition of VR "you look through goggles to see a flat game"? Virtual Boy was not VR by any stretch of the imagination.

edit:

Some interesting memories. You needed a specific Nvidia VR driver that converted most 3d games to work with the headsets at the time. It worked pretty well. The main issue was that most games have a 2D HUD overlay that didn't translate well. The solution was to adjust the depth for each game so that the HUD showed up where the screen was and the 3D worldspace had depth beyond that. So the world had proper depth, but it was like looking out of a window or space suit helmet, rather than being immersed in the environment like we have today. Nothing really "popped out" visually.>>><<<The htc flow looking fly af. Almost would wear that on the streets.

For starters Sega VR was never officially released just some public demos. You included Sega VR but not Atari Jag VR which was essentially had the same outcome and actually had public demos and prototypes just like Sega VR.   


Another issue is you included Virtual Boy, which although was 3D HMD had no head tracking what so ever. Also wasn't color and no headstrap. You included VirtualBoy but not VictorMax StuntMaster which although monoscopic still had primitive head tracking, was a color HMD and head strap.>>><<<Where is the Meta Cambria?

Another issue would be problems with pcvr stability in 120fps mode and av1/hevc codecs. On 90 it works well. In case of dead pixels you can just replace the unit.

I think it's mostly the fact that sex requires focus and effort. It's not something you can do while watching TV unless you're goal is for TV to take your focus off of the sex. 

&gt;but I suspect stuff like this (watching TV etc) during the nasty has gotta be more common than you'd think.

And also, I play games to get away from company and not to get more of it. My overly large family is adequately providing for my need for human interaction, to say the least, but I can definitely empathise with people not having any connections in life at all.

So yea, AR is a viable option for what you seek (tho I’m not knowledgeable enough to say for sure if it’s better/worse than VR for this case). 

With my limited understanding of AR you would most likely hang a poster on the wall/ceiling with a QR code on it and it would look like a working TV screen with the AR glasses on. If you want a screen that floats directly in front of you regardless of where you are looking it might be better to do VR instead.>>><<<With AR you could at least see each other and not have your entire vision blocked.

What you want for watching TV or looking at a screen are these: [https://www.tcl.com/au/en/glasses/tcl-nxtwearg/landing](https://www.tcl.com/au/en/glasses/tcl-nxtwearg/landing)>>><<<What the fuck>>><<<Are they still selling the htc vive flow? That seems like the best option.>>><<<"I'm looking for a comfortable wireless vr headset primarily for watching TV"
Oculus I guess

"In case anyone is wondering, it's so I can watch The Office while I'm balls deep in my lady. Hopefully I can nut right when Chandler says Bazinga. I will also be /shocked/ if anyone comments on this behavior"

Godspeed OP. Please report back>>><<<I feel like a tablet or laptop for one of you and set up with "watch with friends" would work (some service that syncs your stream watching)

You could also host your own instance of big screen VR and stream one on a quest or something but that feels like overkill. (Though this method would let you both watch the same thing)

Why not use positions that let you both face the same direction?>>><<<I think it will be challenging to get it synced with a regular TV. Maybe if you used a computer to display on the TV, then you could link the headset to the computer as well. But that's not exactly simple to set up. 

Plus you'll find it hot and uncomfortable and it looks funny. A well-placed mirror might work a lot better.>>><<<I say television but what we use in our bedroom is just a computer with a large monitor and online streaming services/ websites.>>><<<with VR you can fuck yourself>>><<<this whole thread is wild. Does some incel have a bot army downvoting the good advice? So weird.

I think you should do like google cardboard as others have mentioned to try it out first.

Anyway, don't let anyone kink shame you!>>><<<Yeah for real, like 90% of the comments are kinda just asking OP to justify their actions. It was a simple ask and even pointed out that this sub is not for life advice but VR. I’m sure many are joking but yeah if I imagine how an incel sub would respond this ain’t too far off…>>><<<Maybe just get another TV or PC display to place it conveniently?>>><<<The oculus Go might fit your needs. They’re likely cheap now, and lightweight>>><<<N Real glasses>>><<<Have you thought about using the nreal air? Tehy're like AR glasses with HDMI in. You can have the screen overlayed over your view and you don't have to worry about a heavy headset or tracking.

This is crazy as fuck but like I'm interested.>>><<<Well, okay.
Wireless is probably the way to go so some obvious options would be quest 2/pico 4 maybe even an arpara aio when that comes out. That's a bit pricey for 2 minutes of TV watching so as someone already said google cardboard is an option. I could understand however if your people of taste in which case your looking at an oled system most of which are wired. Samsung Odyssey+ is the best price for performance.>>><<<The problem with the current devices is that they are not small.  They weigh about a pound.  And run about $400 and up.   So then you are looking at media player "VR" sets.  There were a few of these types of things a few years ago, but I can't speak about what is available now.

I would believe an option would be for one person to wear the device and the other partner can see what is playing on a pc.  This would require something like a Meta Quest using Air Link (you DO NOT want to deal with cables) so again, this gets a bit pricey.>>><<<Video goggles with like a phone holder are a cheap solution. If you want something more immersive, you could always grab  quest 2 and buy erp ready models on booth for interactivity in vrchat private rooms>>><<<My wife and I did something similar with the quest 2. The hardest part was the boundary thing in Quests UI but otherwise it was a lot of fun.>>><<<honestly, any headset you can slip your phone screen into. Just download an app on your phone to watch media in VR, slide it into a headset with a compartment for it, boom: Sex and Entertainment. 

Other solution: Oculus Quest 2>>><<<You can get something a bit smaller than that, glasses with monitors have been around a while. Never a popular product but you can find the odd ones out there [https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/tcls-mirrorshade-tv-glasses-plug-an-extra-monitor-onto-my-face/](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/tcls-mirrorshade-tv-glasses-plug-an-extra-monitor-onto-my-face/)  
This seems to work well for you>>><<<the future is now, old man>>><<<Haha, you funny man>>><<<I would suggest the "Meta Quest 2".it is small and if you can make a ponytail with your hair and put it over the headstrap it is really comfortable.  
Also it allows "Passthrough", both during a watchsession as the background behind the screen as well as per quick double-tap on the side, instantly pausing the movie/application for passthrough.

Passthrough allows you to see your surroundings through the Headset-Camera, allowing you to reposition yourself in the realworld without taking the headset off, but still seeing your surroundings.  


It is a standalone device, meaning you need no Computer to run it, but it is not super cheap at around 300-400$.>>><<<Thank you OP, for bringing some good fucking content (pardon the pun) to this sub. I wouldn't go past Google Cardboard where cost is concerned for this, VR is a different beast from just watching a flat screen and you don't know whether you or your partner is particularly vulnerable to VR nausea. If it didn't work out I'd expect it'd be difficult to return or resell a pair of Quest 2's with, uh, stains.>>><<<Aight despite how hilarious i found the idea of 2 people shagging while wearing vr watching tv shows (what came to my mind was sonic x lmfao)
Ill give my recommendations


 theres the oculus go which is light, only has 3 dof but thats all u need for tv / porn / some of the more basic games
Theres the quest 1
Vive with wireless kit so long as they have a pc
If tlyou are fine with a cable theres plenty of wmr headsets for cheap
Personally i still havent found a vr headset more comfortbale than the vive focus 1.
Maybe the vive flow would be good for sex stuff? I cant say personally as i havent even seen one in person but i know its light and quite comfortable from what ive heard?

I hope any of that can help. Give some updates on what tv shows you watch next time yall go at it>>><<<This just sounds like r/freeuse with extra steps>>><<<ITT: A bunch of people mad that two loving adults are enjoying themselves.

Just get a Quest. Small, portable, cheap-ish. 

Alternatively get a couple of mirrors. Even cheaper, although people will absolutely know why you've got mirrors all over your bedroom. But who cares, you enjoy your shit.>>><<<Wow, what a revolutionary solution to the age-old problem of not being able to watch TV while having sex. I'm sure no one has ever thought to just stop and focus on the sex itself, or to try different positions that allow both partners to see the screen. But no, clearly the only solution is to strap on some VR headsets and completely detach from each other and the physical world. Keep on prioritizing screens and media over genuine human connection, dude.>>><<<Girlfriend name is rubber cylinder>>><<<Both of you get a gym membership, it'll be cheaper. And you'll enjoy looking at each other instead of the TV or VR during sex again.

This isn't relationship advice, its financial advice. It's the cheaper option.>>><<<Hey OP, just wanted to drop a comment saying fuck all the haters in this post. If you and your partner are happy that's all that matters. Butthurt e-boys gonna butthurt.

As for headsets there isn't really anything on the market at the moment that does what you're looking for in a decently lightweight form factor. The new Valve headset (deckard) sounds like it'd probably have the display resolution etc that you're looking for, but it's likely to be very expensive at release.

Good luck in your search!>>><<<We've taken another step to the future, folks.>>><<<... oculus quest 2, i guess?>>><<<I once had my wonderful, understanding, adventurous wife let me have sex with her while I wore my vive.  I loaded up a model of Mercy from overwatch in Mocu Mocu dance, and well you get the picture.

Especially if the positions are weird enough where 2 TVs/screens are insufficient. Even if it holds you will probably get a headache or nausea from the tight strap and screen shake. Might be viable for one of you if you just lay down and look at the ceiling during sex. I heard that HTC Vive Flow is pretty comfortable for media consumption but it's definitely not cheap.

You should rather just buy a headstrap for your phone.

They look like sunglasses and are meant for AR, but you can put blinders on the front to turn them into VR. They're very thin as far as VR headsets go, and they run on USB C to an app connected to your phone (or to a PC).>>><<<This thread is amazing, thank you reddit.>>><<<OP, am I understanding correctly that your dream setup would be two sets of goggles, one for you and one for your partner, that would allow you to watch the same streaming content simultaneously? 

Are you wanting to blind yourself so you can see only the screen? Or do you and your partner want to see each other's bodies with virtual floating screens just added to your environment? 

I'm imagining it'd be pretty hard to enjoy Better Call Saul while intimate together outside of doggy style.

I did some digging and the Vufine Wearable Display Smart Glasses might do it on a budget.

If budget isn't an issue I think the Epson Moverio would fit the bill.>>><<<I recall seeing mention of some people trying that before, though maybe a couple years back. I definitely want to try it, so many intriguing possibilities.

Ignore all the people who are saying it's weird and crazy, people are always such prudes about stuff but in a few years I am certain at least half of them will be trying it themselves and there will probably be special apps just for it.

As far as form factor, [Vive Flow] (https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-flow/overview/) could be a good candidate for this as it is very low profile and much closer to a pair of glasses, though it still uses an external wired power bank and you'd probably have to jury rig some elastic to clamp it on depending on how vigorous your activity levels are. I would probably start with those as a base if I was going to attempt this now in a serious fashion, but they are five hundred bucks a pop though and not good for much else beyond very light content use. It's possible they do a fully standalone version in the next couple of years though.

Since Google cancelled Daydream I am unfortunately not sure how well phone-based VR works any more as Daydream doesn't run on newer devices and you may have to hunt down and side-load APKs. I used to stream from Plex on PC to Daydream all the time, worked great but I don't know how tricky it would be to set up nowadays.

Super inexpensive option, which I would seriously consider: Oculus Go are/were very nice light inexpensive stand-alone units that are unfortunately not made any more, but were ideal simple VR media viewers with ok resolution and they can still be used for streaming video from PC with [skybox](https://skybox.xyz/). Less than $100 on eBay each, sometimes a lot less. You will need to make a Meta account though to use them. Probably the simplest cheapest solution right now for a very lightweight device.

As pointed out there are some relatively inexpensive "video glasses" devices, but it depends whether you want to be only viewing traditional 2d content vs VR video, I think VR content is obviously much more appealing for the use case, but it does sound like you just want to watch TV. But a device specifically made for VR will give you both options.>>><<<To each their own. Vive Flow is probably what you want. Light, wireless, Bluetooth connection to your phone, and can play movies/videos with a theater-like feel. Streaming sites should work too iirc>>><<<George Constanza is that you??>>><<<Real advice you should get the nReal Air.>>><<<It will most likely be unsupported sooner rather than later as bytedance has stopped making consumer headsets.>>><<<Is there many bugs in terms of PCVR to be aware of? I'll most likely be using it for that only and immersed from time to time.>>><<<One Thing to notice is that most games if not all of them, got no configuration for pico controllers so they show you quest controllers instead and sometimes you will miss a function on the controller 

In my case: I can't open the menu in zero caliber because button mapping not working 

Half Life alyx showed me valve controllers and showed me how to use a touchpad I didn't have.

Most of the time you can download a custom controller calibration from steam so you have a workaround.>>><<<They have already started unsupporting it. Live streams are gone for the past two months.>>><<<That's not entirely true, we still have OS and Streaming Assistant updates on the way, the beta launched couple of weeks ago. And also got new game releases last month  (Arizons Sunshine 2)

I just think they're focusing on a Vision Pro knockoff rather than going the Quest route>>><<<Official word on this?>>><<<What do you want to use it for?

For PCVR it's perfectly fine, for standalone I'd highly recommend a Quest 3.  
Bytedance laid off half the Pico staff recently and it's not sure if there'll be any other Pico headsets.  
So I wouldn't invest in Pico's game store. Your money could be wasted. 

And even for PCVR gaming the Quest 3 is IMO the better. choice if you aren't tight on money.

I had the Pico 4 and liked it very much for PCVR.  
Upgraded to Quest 3 and sold the Pico 4 because I like the Quest 3 better. 

The Pico 4 was definitely a step up from Quest 2 due to better lenses and higher res.

The facial interface was atrocious, though.  
bought a new AMVR one that actually fit and had no light bleed on the sides like the stock one.

I also didn't like the fixed headstrap.

Many people complain that the Quest headsets need 3rd party headstraps to be made comfortable.  
I actually see this as a big advantage because there's many to choose from so that you really can find the right one for yourself.

The fit of the Pico 4 strap was OK, but not perfect.

What's also annoying is that it doesn't come with headphones. 
That alone is not so bad because you can just use your own - right?

Yeah, but somehow they thought it would be a good idea to NOT include a 3.5mm headphone jack to easily connect any headphones.

Instead you have to buy a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter that ideally also has an additional charging port.

It took me a lot of time to find one that actually works and supports up to 18W charging power. 
And it cost me an additional 20 eur.

 Having the adapter always dangling from the USB port wasn't optimal and I hated that Pico cheaped out on the. 3.5mm port.

Also I thought the displays to just be bright enough on 100%.
A bit darker and it would have been not acceptable for me.

Also worth to note that the image calibration is a little warmer (so tends to go into the reds) compared to Quest headsets.

The controllers are fine, especially compared to the bulky Quest 2 ones. 
However I like the ringless Quest 3 controllers even more.>>><<<Yes it'll be primarily PCVR, and the only experience I've had was the quest 2 for the past week or so (borrowed from mate, not mine). Where I am the Pico 4 is a third the price of the quest 3 so that's a pretty big no in that regard.>>><<<If you really only want to use it for PCVR, go for it.

Does your friend who owns the Quest 2 also use PCVR?

Because don't underestimate social aspects.

If you want to play with your friend together online and he doesn't play PCVR but standalone not every game supports cross platform play.

So it's better to be on the same platform.

But yes, the Pico 4 is a very nice wireless PCVR headset.

And for 1/3 the price compared to Quest 3 it is the better choice.

But please make sure you can use it wirelessly.

Wireless VR gaming is just the best! 

So if you don't already have a capable router consider buying a dedicated Wifi6 router.>>><<<Nah he doesn't do PCVR but he also doesn't use the headset for much except when he has friends over (hence why he was ok with me borrowing it).

&amp;#x200B;

By making sure I can use it wirelessly would the limitation only be on the wifi connection?>>><<<Maybe he would use it more often if he had a friend he could play with?  ;)

I play Walkabout Minigolf and Elven Assassin regularly with friends online and we're all on Quest 2 and 3 headsets.

So it's super easy to all communicate via Quest group call.

Then we just jump into the games (running standalone on all Quests) and have fun. 

Anyway - cross play limitations stem from the game, no matter if you have a cable connection or wireless. 

If you don't want to play online with friends or accept that there's many games that are not cross platform compatible, then go for the Pico 4.

It's a very capable and fine PCVR headset.>>><<<Fortunately some of the most liked coop/multiplayer games have very good crossplay support. The mentioned Walkabout Minigolf I also play regularly with friends and we have a mix of Quest 2/3, PSVR 2 and PCVR. Works flawlessly.>>><<<Apreciate it!>>><<<&gt;Where I am the Pico 4 is a third the price of the quest 3 so that's a pretty big no in that regard.

It's really interesting to see different people talking about VR prices in wherever they live. Here, a Pico 4 is the same price as a Quest 2. And that's about 4/5s of the price of a 128Gb Quest 3, even so slightly less. (And half the price of a 512Gb Quest 3).>>><<<I owned one since launch and the biggest issu is the comfort. The fabric they use on the facefoam is shit. its worth it to buy amvr facegasket. Next big issue is if you want to use headphones and powerbank at ones you need an adapter with jack and usb-c,so you can charge the headset while playing or bobo vr batterypack for pico. How much money do you want to use on the pico untill you reach quest 3 price? Pico 4 has better bionocular overlap than quest 3. the picture quality in pcvr is almost the same in ultra using virtual desktop. Both headset have umstable wifi connection, not all but many does.>>><<<Thanks! Yeah the Q3 is almost 3 times the price of the pico where I am so honestly the accessories won't be that bad.

I've heard the edge clarity is better on the Q3 then Pico though? Or did you just mean the IPD adjustment when you say binocular overlap>>><<<The picture overlap is better on pico. Edge to edge is little bit better on quest 3, but you will only see the different if you swap between quest 3 and pico 4. Its not like "WOW, i cant use pico 4 cause quest 3 has little bit better edge to edge clarity"😅>>><<<For me there are no big issues with it but here are my biggest gripes:

Being a standalone headset the controller tracking fails outside the range of the headset cameras. I much prefered the full room volume tracking of my old PCVR setup with wall moutned cameras. Can't throw things perfectly naturally with a standalone headset for example.

Far fewer standalone app than Meta. Also fewer SideQuest apps.

Often the lenses are made with slight imperfections that causes slight visible wavyness when you move your head sideways with obvious horizontal elements in the image. My left lens is perfect but my right lens has this slightly. It's only noticeable in the menu though.>>><<<If you are only using it for PCVR these won't matter at at all, but for me the worst thing about the global Pico 4 is the way the global non-game resources are very limited compared to what is available to the Chinese users. That includes frequent engagement with the user community, livestreams, larger selection of videos and films, public viewing rooms, Douyin interactivity, etc.>>><<<No headset is perfect, and there are always minor things you wish were different. So with that said, the only big issue I would say is the default facial interface is pretty awful. Both the AMVR and GeekVR interfaces are very good though.

Only other semi-big issue is the pico store has significantly less in it than the quest store. If you are strictly doing PCVR, this doesn't matter at all. But there are some good standalone games, and quite a few of them don't come out on Pico.

For the price though, it's an incredible headset!>>><<<I'd say the worst aspects are the standalone software support, the lens glare/internal reflections, the screens are a bit washed out in terms of colour and contrast compared to the competition, no 3.5mm headphone output and the Pico PC streaming software is some of the worst I have seen.

Super comfy and excellent sharpness though, and obviously the streaming side can be taken care of by other solutions like Virtual Desktop.  If I didn't have a Q3 here to directly compare it to I'd be totally happy with it for PCVR.>>><<<The worst aspect is it's WIFI, you'll fry your brain, I'm not even joking. I was using it every day for almost a hour, I started loosing the sense of touch in 2 fingers of my left hand, targeted headaches, and loss of balance. I didn't know it came from the headset. I stopped using it for a while, and everything came back to normal, until I'd use the headset again. I'm not sure the WIFI is "really" off if you put it off, so just turning it off alone doesn't help, yeah I tried, in fact I tried many times just because I didn't want to not use my headset anymore,... It may sound a bit nuts but I swear I'm not a conspiracy theorist haha! I would not buy another headset that has WIFI or even all the electronics, just the screens starts to sound safer for me. Hope that helps!>>><<<Apart from support issues, it’s very good value and it’s comfortable out of box…it’s a bit dim compared to Quest and colors are bit washed out due to cheap LCD panels.>>><<<Comfort may depend on where you bought it and your lineage .. the Asian market version has much less space for the nose, it was murder on me. Least comfortable headset I've ever worn by far.>>><<<Compression and comfort. The bitrate is much lower than quest so the artifacts are very obvious. The facial interface is pretty much a torture device.>>><<<Recently got one because I didn’t want to spend twice as much on a Quest 3 as I mainly do PCVR, and I’d say the only thing that bugs me is the glare and reflections in the lenses, as it often makes things look like my lenses are fogged up. Though this has happened to ever VR headset I’ve owned so I’m not sure you can avoid it. Everything else has been a blast.>>><<<Is that reflection from light leaked from outside env? New to VR and not sure how things work just yet>>><<<No, say you’re looking at a bright screen on a black background, the brightness of the screen will make a bloom effect on the black background around the screen, making things look foggy or “smeary”. This will happen any time there’s a big contrast on screen, which is more than you’d think, especially in VR.>>><<<thanks!>>><<<&gt; wireless streaming, or hands tracking.. I believe, Pico does not have to invent anything now.. just add all Quest features, should be way quicker to copy things. 

Pico had wireless streaming before Oculus did. Pico made wireless VR headsets before Oculus. So if anything, the copying has been going the other way. Pico did it first.>>><<<Well, it would be worse, if that Pico streaming assistant has been developed for years and all they got is this super basic app, which is worse than the Virtual Desktop.

There on my Quest 2 I never even did use Virtual Desktop as default Airlink works so well with the same Xiaomi WiFi6 router at max 200mbps.>>><<<&gt; which is worse than the Virtual Desktop.

People that actually use it properly say it's better. The ones that don't just haven't configured it properly.

&gt;  it actually has quite a few benefits over Virtual Desktop

https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/yfrisz/pico_4_pcvr_tips_how_to_make_the_pico_streaming/>>><<<Thanks! I did not know the resolution is controlled through steam and it affects everything. I will give it a second shot.>>><<<looking forward receiving my Pico :)>>><<<Hands tracking is available in developer mode. Although very slow atm and very clunky. Q2 is way better with it. 

Also you can't use the Oculus Store Q2 exclusives in PC VR if they would not have ran on the PC VR oculus headsets.>>><<<Agree, hands tracking 2.0 is better on Quest and 2.1 will be coming soon.. but again Quest has released hands 2.0 less than 4 months ago [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prr0r1iKX7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prr0r1iKX7o)  


And if Pico is already promoting games like Unplugged Air Guitar. It should take even less to put 2.0 tracking on Pico.>>><<<Wait u can play Oculus quest 2 games? Or you mean Oculus Rift game only as i know?>>><<<Yes, almost all "Quest exclusive" games are available in Oculus Store on PC. And Virtual Desktop allows to run any Quest Store PC game on Pico with just one click. And there are only a few games left on Onculus store as exclusive, as pretty much every popular VR title is available on Steam and even cheaper now too.>>><<<You could have avoided some confusion by using the more specific “Oculus Rift store” or “Oculus Quest store” rather than the generic “Oculus store”.

The Pico can play all Oculus games, *provided* they are on the Rift store.>>><<<Sure if you don't mind the Chinese government harvesting your data and spying on you, then it sounds great.>>><<<Google did it first.

And Chinese did us nothing wrong but someone else is very upset about EU being friends with "enemies". It's just that they are not our enemies...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯>>><<<One would think that given the current state of global affairs, particularly what's going on with Russia at the moment, people would understand that its dangerous to do business with countries that don't respect human life. But hey that's just my take. And just to be clear, I'm not American, I'm not pro-American either. It really seems like the world is just making the same mistakes that lead to ww2. That's my opinion, your entitled to yours as well, that's one of the great things about democracy, too bad the Chinese people don't get to have those freedoms. But hey that's not your problem right?>>><<<That’s fair. In the households of sensitive government or business personnel, I could see a risk. But I doubt the CCRP has an intelligence interest in a SLP’s gameroom.>>><<<Your probably right but why would you help fund their espionage?  And who knows what they do with the info, and what info they collect exactly. 

Would you purchase a headset that you knew had direct links to the Russian government?  Given all the stuff going on I'd hope the answer would be no, so why would the answer be different if it's Chinese? They are bad actors on the world stage, it's silly to welcome them into your home with cameras and access to your home network.>>><<<They may be. I also can’t assume nefarious ends. I have definite bias, but no proof of intent. Also, I can’t say I’m directly funding, except if taxes or fees are collected by a govt, which might be the case for other manufactured goods from a given country. Besides, Pico’s emergence signals competition in a free market. I support that>>><<<Competition is good. But Pico is not just competition, it's a Chinese government puppet. The concerns surrounding it are just too massive to ignore simply for cheap goods.>>><<<Then Meta and Sony need to get with the program. I think it’s funny that Germany will sell Pico, but not Quest 😂>>><<<Ya your absolutely right. We/they all need to do better.>>><<<Germany also happily took Russian gas but and levied empty threats at them for the longest time (including many years leading up to the war, when they could have switched earlier with much less pain). So yeah, Germany is mostly driven by profit and convenience.>>><<<I prefer sending my data to Chinese instead of US communist party. :) Why do you think all big tech gets away with tax evasion, monopolies and all other stuff above the law? Maybe they are already working for the 'local communist party'.>>><<<Sure, OK.  Lol.  Your ignorance is amazing. Lucky for you, you have the freedom to think for yourself and don't have to worry about being disappeared in the middle of the night for voicing your own opinion. Sadly the same can't be said those unfortunate enough to live in places like Russia &amp; china. Enjoy your freedoms provided by democracy.>>><<<Freedom to be silenced, if the opinion does not fit current agenda.   
Business, famous people canceled for not supporting 'the current thing'.  
The land of free and democracy pointing fingers... :)>>><<<Do you not live in a democratic nation, enjoying the freedoms it provides? The fact you on here sharing your opinion points to the answer of yes. It's pretty nice eh? You know, speaking your mind without fear of being punished. 

Is it a perfect system? Hell no. Is it better than what happens in Russia &amp; China?  Absolutely. 

I for one will sleep pretty good tonight knowing that no one will come for me in the middle of the night because I spoke out, you should too.>>><<<lmao, you don't live in China so you know shit about China. I'm so smart because I trust what the US talks ab China. Currently live in China, talk shit ab the government and haven't disappeared in the night. Seriously, yoy should consider going to China once in your life. Compared to the USA, Chinese does everything better. You think your country has better economy? not anymore. You think your country has better community? not anymore. You think your country has stronger army? absolutely not anymore. Lastly, the Chinese has their own internet, sites so you don't have a chance to see their freedom when you aren't here. I'm not pro China or smth like that but I'm a traveler. Do not believe anything the government say, see it with your own eyes.>>><<<So you’d rather let Mark Zuckerberg harvest it?>>><<<Um ya rather than a communist regime that's hell bent on destroying democracy, absolutely.>>><<<Are you talking about Brandon hell bent on destroying democracy?>>><<<Yeah that's a no brainer just for the comfort of having pancake lenses with the weight at the back.>>><<<I'm just here to complain about 3D pie charts. They're the worst and nobody should use them. Thanks for coming to my TED talk and have a good day.>>><<<Yeah, what's the point of dividing things by size then distorting their size with perspective? It looks "neat" I guess but I'd take a nicely done 2D pie chart any day.>>><<<Thanks for the feedback. I will make the next one in 2d. I thought the 3d effect looked kinda fancy. But if peeps fully hate that, I'll change it up.>>><<<It should also say “All others combined” not “combines”. 😁>>><<<Those are for a really realistic farming simulator experience.>>><<<Op’s alt account?>>><<<Look at the watermark in the image>>><<<*Op is alt account?>>><<<Rofl>>><<<Nah, although if OP would like to continue reposting our posts, that would make everyone on our team beyond happy. I honestly didn't think my chart would get any attention here so I only posted on our [Planet Theta](https://planet-theta.com) social media ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/planettheta/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PlanetTheta), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Planet_Theta), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/GgwnUPsn2G)). I am guessing OP follows one of these accounts and if OP reads this, I want to thank you for pushing us out there like this. **Super cool!**>>><<<Even 2D pie charts [are bad](http://www.graphgraph.com/2011/12/pie-charts-are-terrible/), 3D pie charts are just next-level awful.>>><<<I applaude to your ted talk>>><<<Give me 1D pie charts or nothing!>>><<<I prefer 4d hyperpie>>><<<I lol when I read this. Also, why don't you like my pie chart? Would you prefer a bar graph? I am making these every few days so I can make one more to your liking next time.>>><<<The way it's laid out, it's difficult to both read the small labels and also see the whole chart. At least on mobile. I can only really view one side at a time 

The most important information is the labels and proportions if we are trying to actually compare it at a glance. In this photo the rift S appears somewhat bigger than the index.>>><<<I really like the feedback! The next one I make will be sized for mobile instead of only desktop. As for the proportions, I agree. I had not noticed that before you pointed it out, but you are right. I will consider not using the 3d version next time as you are not the only one to point out issues with how it makes things look.>>><<<Having the headset names or logos inside of their section with a large clear font might also make it easier to take in and compare them together.>>><<<I would get a Valve Index but Valve won't ship it while promising to "Expand to other countries as well" for the last two years.

Unlike the Oculus devices that were accessible in most locations in the world.

The Quest2 is crazy value for what it is sold for. There is no real competition at this point, I wish there was but there isn't.>>><<<And there will never be, unless another company, which can afford to lose money will enter the market. The only competition for Facebook can really come from the rest of the Big 5 Tech companies and only Apple is currently developing AR and VR devices and at the same time I am quite sure they won’t compete in the entry-level market.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<MS also has some pretty big VR devs under their belt now. as well as pc and console platforms (WMR was mostly getting scraps fromhololens) Although like most they are/were targetting ar as they thought VR wouldn't make enough of a dent, the quest is showing them that FB/Meta has a pretty good path to an ecosystem.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<They had a rather large setback about 3 years ago when their head of wmr (before they called it that) died in a car crash too.  Add in the xbox one generational policy of "no wired devices" and that prevented them from releasing an xboxVR.  Samsung and HP are the only ones who even made revisions to their hardware. 

They just keep shooting themselves in the foot>>><<<Kinect was functionally only marginally better than what Sony had. The tech was more sophisticated though and was more capable. 

 Nintendo and Sony afaik had done a ton of research on controller less interfaces and decided it wasnt viable as a control scheme. I think it was lack of feedback wasnt satisfying. 

Ms tripled down and spent a ton of money promoting Kinect and it sold better than any gaming  peripheral, but Sony and Nintendo were right. 

Ms has the tech but they sometimes fail in ways only huge companies can. 

To clarify I'm rooting for them in vr against meta and love my Samsung Odyssey plus, but wmr is sorely lagging while they focus on the admittedly more profitable corporate ar.>>><<<&gt; Kortana 

I will grow old and go to my grave still complaining about what they did to the OG kinect voice assistant. My living room has never been as smart as it was in 2013 when I could just hop on the couch and go "Hey xbox, let's watch some netflix" and it would 1) recognize me 2) open netflix on my profile 3) grab something from my queue and start playing

And then if you want to pause it to get a drink or something you just...stand up.

I guess it didn't all go to waste though, the kinect tech is definitely living on in Hololens and WMR. And there's some really cool open source/indie dev projects working with that hardware now.>>><<<PSVR2 will be great but It's not gonna be that huge of a hit until PS5s are more available to everyone to easily buy.>>><<<high tier next when cambria comes out>>><<<&gt; I wouldn’t discount Sony and PSVR.

You must be new here.

I don't think I've seen sales compared directly, but they're pretty much the best-kept secret on this sub for as little as anyone talks about them.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<My point is that discounting Sony is /r/virtualreality's bread and butter.>>><<<Asking in good-faith, is there really anything to talk about currently?

I feel like it's a separate market in a lot of ways unless PSVR2 can work with PCVR.>>><<<And how exactly is Oculus not a separate market? There's nothing about VR that requires PC compatibility, and this is the VR sub, not the PCVR sub.>>><<<The top level comment was talking about the Valve Index, so this discussion was about the PCVR market. The Quest can natively connect to PC, which makes it relevant when talking about PCVR. PSVR cannot connect natively, so it is a completely separate market.>>><<<Completely agree with you.>>><<<Oh yeah apples device will be expensive and old tech because it's an apple product. I'm hoping Amazon will step in and make it a fair fight, they've shown interest in gaming ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯>>><<<Apple who make one of the most powerful SoCs on the market you mean?

Their headset will blow the XR2 away, but the problem is actually then releasing something>>><<<..Valve? I mean isn’t the answer literally right under our nose lol.

Just like the Steam Deck, if they set themselves to it they definitively could.>>><<<Yeah I don't love that it's fb who runs oculus but there's no other company making headsets right now aimed at the general public, I feel like. While I would love to have the disposable income, space, and time to properly utilize a valve index, the Oculus stuff is just so much more approachable at this point...>>><<<Facts. 

I grew up in Asia and I always wanted to get in to VR but literally so fucking expensive and I really had no experience with any VR system. The quest 2 was an amazing starter. ready out of the box and I personally have had no issues with it. I understand Oculus has a lot of issues both with the system or with whole facebook thing but its really hard to beat the price for what you get with the quest 2>>><<<The reason it appears cheap is because fb has you pay with your soul lol>>><<<I just got one.  
Luckily I have literally nothing on facebook and don't count on using the Oculus Store which I hope will limit the soul selling thing.  
When a next gen non FB headset will be available I'll probably buy it, regardless of the fact that it will be sold below cost or not.>>><<<Facebook even tracks you outside of Facebook. A shit ton of websites still share info with facebook>>><<<I have tons from the store, but IMO the best games in the quest are dr beef's ports, and those  just require the base games from steam.>>><<<Unless you go to great lengths to block Facebook,  they can track you and build a profile on you even if you never put any info on yourself. 

I have never made a real Facebook profile but yet the one time I tried to make a fake profile just to claim some freebie,  they actually had most of my real info pre-filled in (because my sister probably gave them a lot of that info).

I was so creeped out that I canceled the whole thing and I've blocked them completely at the DNS level as well as any Javascript or cookies trying to track me.    I'm probably STILL being tracked but at least I am not giving them everything.>>><<<I always see this being said, but can anyone actually back it up? From my understanding, ad renenue earns pennies compared to the walled garden shop and expensive accessories. Also, how do people know more data is extracted and used compared to other companies?>>><<<Facebook doesn’t collect any more information on the Oculus platform itself than Steam or any other store does. It’s the fact that they track you across your entire life that people find uncomfortable. 

Steam uses past purchases and playtime to recommend new games on their platform to buy. I don’t think anyone has any issue with this.

Facebook can use information about your life, whether whether you frequent a rock climbing gym, or read articles on cars online, or interact frequently with a friend that plays MMOs etc to to sell you things. It’s the breadth of what they know that’s frightening to people, not the depth from any one source.

If you have a Facebook account, you can see exactly how much information Facebook is getting from outside their platforms. If you don’t have an account, this data profile of you still exists, but it won’t be accessible to you.
https://www.facebook.com/off-facebook-activity>>><<<It's really less about how Facebook use *your* data and how they use the collective data that they've collected about societies.

And that's by unscrupulously selling it to any one looking to manipulate masses of people, including the most vulnerable and susceptible, and thereby providing easy access to advanced tools for bad actors to devastate society.

If Facebook were scrupulous about how they used the data and what they did with it, I don't think many would mind nearly as much.>>><<<The apps pay nothing. Zuck has been clear the quest hemorrhages money. The point is to kill off the competition and own the future.>>><<<They don't. It's all accusations and conspiracies. I did actually pull data that both Oculus and Steam pull from me, and guess what? Steam has *a lot* more data about me than Oculus.

People like to pretend that Facebook sends some burglars to break into their computers to steal their precious ~~bodily fluids~~ data and act like they aren't actively giving that data away.>>><<<&gt; Steam has a lot more data about me than Oculus

But, one thing to consider, since Facebook requires you link your FB account, that Oculus data gets added to the reset of your Facebook data.>>><<<And Steam tracks you via UTMs, as they list on their website. AKA sameway Facebook does.

And so what ifnthey "add" your data to Facebook accoint? Like, can you give an actual issue instead of some hand wringing about "targetes ads" that is not 100% hypocritical nonsense?>>><<<&gt;I did actually pull data that both Oculus and Steam pull from me, and guess what? Steam has a lot more data about me than Oculus.

I'm going to have to see some proof on that. There is no way that Valve has more data on you than Facebook.

Facebook builds shadow profiles on people to the point that without ever touching one of their products they still know your entire relationship graph. Oculus may not be pulling that data directly, but they're still getting it from somewhere. You're essentially handing them the keys to add on everything else a VR headset and biometric data allows.

&gt;People like to pretend that Facebook sends some burglars to break into their computers to steal their precious bodily fluids data and act like they aren't actively giving that data away.

The problem is that if you want to enter the VR market at a reasonable price point *you don't have a choice.* You can either pay $1500+ to get a VR PC and an Index or pay $300 for a Quest 2 and then $500+ down the line for a VR PC (if you can even find a decent one in stock right now). That cheaper entry and lower price point mean that you're giving Facebook full access to a view of your home and mics for your conversations and activities. Whether they're actively using it or not isn't really the point when they've already proven they will use that avenue for data in the past. It's a when not if question.>>><<<&gt;I'm going to have to see some proof on that. There is no way that Valve has more data on you than Facebook.

I said Oculus. As in, data they gather via your headset. [Now, compare data collected via Steam vs. Oculus](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/qr3wvd/i_dont_know_why_but_it_seems_like_theres_a_lot_of/hk7mz9g/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Whatever extra data you give to Facebook is collected via other routes, such as *using Facebook.* Don't use Facebook = no data for them.

&gt;The problem is that if you want to enter the VR market at a reasonable price point you don't have a choice. 

And whose fault is that? Facebook for producing affordable headset, or everyone else for refusing to produce affordable headset despite being capable of it?

People like to pretend Facebook is sending some sort of black-ops teams to tear down competitors, when in reality it is simple fact of nobody else taking VR seriously.

&gt;That cheaper entry and lower price point mean that you're giving Facebook full access to a view of your home and mics for your conversations and activities.

And we enter conspiracy land! Fun fact, none of that shit is uploaded to any servers, it remains in your headset. You want to claim they are uploading your home schematics or listening on random conversations, prove it. Actually prove it, show the data being uploaded or data being on the server.

Don't just quote the Privacy Agreement like a brainless zombie, because if you do I know instantly you have no understanding of system. Collecting data is not same as storing data. For example, they collect hand data when you use hand tracking. That is what the hand tracking *needs in order to work*. Once the data is processed in the headset, it is discarded. At no point does the data leave the headset.

You want to claim they are uploading all this supposed data to their severs, *prove it*. Don't just be a mindless zombie that parrots OXI.>>><<<&gt;Don't use Facebook = no data for them.

Any opinion you have on this topic is null and void if you truly believe this. It has been proven time and again that just using the internet will give Facebook all of your data.

&gt;Facebook for producing affordable headset, or everyone else for refusing to produce affordable headset despite being capable of it?

Facebook isn't producing affordable headsets. They're taking a loss on every headset they sell. The only competitor in the space that could potentially do that is Valve, but that would damage their relationships with their partners. It's anti-competitive monopolistic behavior, not some secret formula that Facebook found.

&gt;OXI

I don't even know who OXI is.

&gt;none of that shit is uploaded to any servers, it remains in your headset

Mic data, by its intended usage, has to be uploaded to a server. They use the same "collect" term for mic data that they do for everything else.

&gt;Don't just quote the Privacy Agreement like a brainless zombie

The Privacy Agreement is the literal document telling you what they're going to do and why. It's the only proof consumers are going to get because that user data would be encrypted when it's sent out. You would need access to Quest source code or internal Facebook documents for proof.

So no, when you decide to throw blinders over your eyes of the proof right in front of you there isn't any proof. Let me know how that's working out for anti-vaxxers.

Facebook actively collects the exact same data with the same wording in their privacy agreements for their other products. You would have to be paid or incredibly stupid to believe that they wrote the same wording for their Portal agreement as their Oculus agreement and somehow aren't collecting the same data if it's available.>>><<<I notice you rather quietly refuse to acknowledge data difference between Oculus and Steam and instead move to different topics...

&gt;Any opinion you have on this topic is null and void if you truly believe this. It has been proven time and again that just using the internet will give Facebook all of your data.

And this topic is null and void if you do not have basic concept of "don't use services that are connected to Facebook".

You going to a site with no Facebook service attached does not give Facebook any data. That is a simple fact.

&gt;Facebook isn't producing affordable headsets. They're taking a loss on every headset they sell.

They flat out stated they are selling them at cost, and it is still affordable. "Affordable" means "customers can afford it", it does not mean "is making massive profits".

&gt;The only competitor in the space that could potentially do that is Valve, but that would damage their relationships with their partners. It's anti-competitive monopolistic behavior, not some secret formula that Facebook found.

This is not some grand new evil plan. This is console model 101. Consoles have been doing this since the first one, never mind razor and printer manufacturers. Hell, I can buy a printer cheaper than I can get ink for it!

The fact that Valve is not willing to share of the profits from the software sales when they own 75% of digital distribution market speaks more about their monopolistic behavior than Facebooks.

&gt;Mic data, by its intended usage, has to be uploaded to a server. They use the same "collect" term for mic data that they do for everything else.

Of course it needs to be uploaded in order for VOIP to work. It does not mean it is stored. Case in point: Facebook says it collects your hand data, they also explicitly state that data is not uploaded.

Collecting data =/= uploading data.

&gt;The Privacy Agreement is the literal document telling you what they're going to do and why. It's the only proof consumers are going to get because that user data would be encrypted when it's sent out. You would need access to Quest source code or internal Facebook documents for proof.

No, you would just need to have nice little Wireshark running to observe network activity. Such amount of data would be very much visible. Never mind people misunderstanding what Privacy Agreement even means. People think that when it says "We collect your hand data" it means it is uploaded somewhere, but actually reading the Privacy section of hand tracking it explicitly says that data never leaves your headset.

If you have no proof beyond "it says collect and therefore I stopped thinking any further" this discussion is basically over. "Collect" is not same as "uploaded and stored". Your phone "collects" your voice when you make a call. It doesn't mean everything you say is being uploaded to Google's servers.

&gt;Facebook actively collects the exact same data with the same wording in their privacy agreements for their other products. You would have to be paid or incredibly stupid to believe that they wrote the same wording for their Portal agreement as their Oculus agreement and somehow aren't collecting the same data if it's available.

This is exactly sort of braindead "I see word collect, I stop thinking" I warned about. I will, once again, refer you to hand tracking as a perfect example:

[https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/privacy-information-and-settings/index-privacy-information-and-settings#faq\_535510833906841](https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/privacy-information-and-settings/index-privacy-information-and-settings#faq_535510833906841)

&gt;**How Hand Tracking Works**  
&gt;  
&gt;When hand tracking is enabled, our software analyzes images of your hands from the sensors on your headset to estimate the location of certain key points on your hands, such as your knuckles or fingertips. This analysis is done on your device in real time as your hands are moving. The images and estimated points specific to your hands are deleted after processing, and are not stored on our servers. The software then fits a generic hand model over the estimated points of your hands, resulting in hand pose data which is not specific to you (including approximate position, orientation and finger configuration) and an estimated hand size (represented by standardized numerical values such as between 0.5 and 1.5). To ensure that you have a consistent experience, we store recently generated hand pose data and estimated hand size on your device.  
&gt;  
&gt;**What Data Is Collected**  
&gt;  
&gt;We do not store images or estimated points specific to your hands on our servers. As stated above, this data is processed on the device and deleted once processing is completed. To improve the hand tracking feature, we collect certain data from your device when you choose to use hand tracking. This data includes your usage data, estimated hand size, and source image telemetry (e.g., exposure, contrast). We also collect and retain other information about your interactions with the hand tracking feature consistent with our Privacy Policy, such as tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands, and the number of pinches you make. If your device crashes, we also collect crash logs which may contain similar information as well as recently generated hand pose data. This data is stored and associated with your account until we no longer need it to improve the hand tracking feature or if you delete your account. If you delete your account, the data associated with your account will be deleted or disassociated from your account.

They list all the stuff they "collect", but all the data that is collected is send anywhere.>>><<<&gt;You going to a site with no Facebook service attached does not give Facebook any data. That is a simple fact.

That is absolutely not true. Facebook has tons of trackers all over websites. Go to Banfield pet hospital and make an appointment then look at the trackers. Facebook isn't on there at all but is still getting that data.

You are grossly misinformed on this topic.

&gt;They flat out stated they are selling them at cost

Even assuming they are selling at break-even on BoM, that's not at cost. You still lose money on warranty, support, recalls, etc. They definitely weren't breaking even when it first launched.

&gt;This is not some grand new evil plan. This is console model 101. Consoles have been doing this since the first one, never mind razor and printer manufacturers. Hell, I can buy a printer cheaper than I can get ink for it!

I never said it was new, but it's still monopolistic.

&gt;The fact that Valve is not willing to share of the profits from the software sales when they own 75% of digital distribution market speaks more about their monopolistic behavior than Facebooks.

I'm not even sure what you intend to say with this. Valve has never attempted to stop a competitor. They're in a market-dominating position and take special care not to abuse it. The closest thing to monopolistic behavior Valve has ever done is launch the Steam Deck.

&gt;Of course it needs to be uploaded in order for VOIP to work. It does not mean it is stored. Case in point: Facebook says it collects your hand data, they also explicitly state that data is not uploaded.

&gt;Collecting data =/= uploading data.

But they don't explicitly state that general controller tracking image data or mic data is not uploaded. Even the hand tracking section you quoted has a very specific line item to make sure they're doing what they say they do.

&gt;We do not store images or estimated points **specific to your hands** on our servers.

That reads that they're storing images and estimated points of *something* on their servers. Just not your hands. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a need for clarification.

If Oculus did not store images and had no intention to ever store images, they would very clearly say that in their privacy information as they did here.

&gt;We do not collect or store images from the headset in any capacity.

Boom. Problem solved. No more debate. But they don't and won't put that. I wonder why.

At minimum, they have to store images from your headset for when the controllers lose tracking or drift. That is valuable troubleshooting data they need to improve the product. Those images are going to have your home/playspace in them. It is literally unavoidable.

&gt;"Collect" is not same as "uploaded and stored".

Only it is, and this was proven when Portal messed up and people started to realize their home information was being uploaded despite the privacy agreement using the same terms.

&gt;No, you would just need to have nice little Wireshark running to observe network activity. Such amount of data would be very much visible.

I don't think you fully realize how small these data packets are. Just because it isn't a 24/7 feed from all 5 cameras being uploaded doesn't mean they aren't uploading images. Low-resolution mono-color images are not hefty file sizes.

&gt;I notice you rather quietly refuse to acknowledge data difference between Oculus and Steam and instead move to different topics...

I ignored it because your list wasn't proof. It's no different from reading the Privacy Information that you yourself discount. You didn't collect data, you collected a list of what data might be collected. The data that Valve collects is about what I would expect Valve to collect as a cloud save and storefront provider. That information is also collected by Facebook, just not specifically through legacy Oculus accounts.>>><<<&gt;That is absolutely not true. Facebook has tons of trackers all over websites. Go to Banfield pet hospital and make an appointment then look at the trackers. Facebook isn't on there at all but is still getting that data.

Really? I went to their site and... there is Facebook button right there. They are using Facebook service. Furthermore, if you read their Cookie Settings page:

&gt;'Targeting' cookies are linked to services provided by third parties, such as 'Like' buttons and 'Share' buttons. The third party provides these services in return for recognising that you have visited our website. We use 'Targeting' cookies to  
&gt;* Link to social networks like Facebook, who may subsequently use information about your visit to target advertising to you on other websites

So... you want to try that again?

&gt;I never said it was new, but it's still monopolistic.

So, are  you also calling for Steam to be stopped before they take over the digital distribution?

Or are you just being a hypocrite because you like Steam but not Facebook/Meta?

&gt;But they don't explicitly state that general controller tracking image data or mic data is not uploaded. Even the hand tracking section you quoted has a very specific line item to make sure they're doing what they say they do.

And Steam doesn't explicitly state they don't upload anything of your VR data, and yet...

Seriously, there is no point in discussion when the starting point is a conspiracy theories. What can I even say, that doesn't just get dismissed as "Well, there is no evidence that they *don't*!"

&gt;That reads that they're storing images and estimated points of something on their servers. Just not your hands. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a need for clarification.

Case in point. They state they don't store data -&gt; "But they might still store something!"

Seriously, let me ask you this:

What would there need to be said that you would *not* go all conspiracist on this? Because right now, you are moving the goal post at every point and going "AHA! But you can't prove there *isn't* something that they are hiding!".

Also, let me remind you, that such standard would have to be applied to everyone, not just hypocritical "I demand better from Facebook than everyone else". Because if the Facebook is only one who gets these "stricter" demands, it shows that you are not actually concerned about these issues: you are just using them as a smokescreen.>>><<<I want to buy a Steam Deck so badly but they aren't available in my country ;(>>><<<I know man, I'm in the same boat with you. I've been following it since the start and unable to do crap about it.

I will guess you and I will have to pay E-bay scalpers to get it. :((>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I find these surveys odd. Whenever I complete it on Steam it always says I have no VR headset because it's not connected at the time of gathering data.>>><<<The actual percentage of index's might be higher, but similar to PC gaming mainstream vs high-end, a 300-400 dollar piece of kit is always going to be far far more popular than a 1000 dollar one.>>><<<The only issue is that Index is not that "high-end" compare to Quest 2 if Q2 is "low-end". The difference is marginal, but the price isn't.

I'd buy the Index instead of Q2 if the price difference was worth it, but to me it just isn't. Index seems overpriced because Q2 is underpriced.>>><<<Fair point, I think facebook is going about it pretty cleverly, same way console manufacturers used to sell their hardware for below cost just to get people into the ecosystem.

And it has worked extremely well for them, their userbase is so much bigger now that we hear about games getting downgraded to be able to support standalone quest hardware.

I hope both PCVR and quest manage to get their userbase big enough that neither needs to suffer.>>><<<I hear you.  
I showed my Q2 to a couple of friends and when they heard about the price they got shocked and the first thing they did was to go out and buy one before Black Week hits in and stock may be gone.

I think Oculus is huge for the VR community, even for high-end gamers if it means downgrading games at the moment. Getting everyone in on VR will make everything grow so much more, and these people will be drawn towards higher end equipment with time. Much like I starting out with a shitty console and today I have a high-end PC, and I'm starting out with a Q2 and I know I'll seek out higher-end VRs with the time. Planting a seed will make it grow.

I'd probably never get into the high-end VR if it wasn't for the cheap Q2, and I think **a lot** of people are in the same boat, which I believe will make the high-end section of VR industry explode.>>><<<It's possible, though I don't think it's quite as obvious a consequence. Because if we compare it to PC/console and high end PCs, we can see a similar thing happening and how that goes on average.

People seeing a friend's gaming system (e.g. PS4 or a mid-range PC) can absolutely go fuck yeah, I want one of those, and spend 300-500 to get that experience. 

But if we look at how many people have consoles/mid-range PCs vs the high end... we see not that many people would (or have the means to) jump up to the high end of things.

And when it comes to VR, the jump up from standalone Quest 2 to a high end headset AND a high-end PC to run high res in high enough FPS... that's literally multiple thousands of dollars.

As a PCVR enthusiast my fear is that the Quest 2 won't be a rising tide for all ships, but more of a hungry hungry hippo that slowly attracts more and more market share.

Of course the increasing popularity of VR could cause more developers to create bigger experiences like we all want. Or the increasing popularity of the Quest specifically could cause developers to all focus on the more lucrative platform and leave truly high-end experiences in that are only possible on high end PCVR in the past.>>><<<The ability to do PCVR with it as well is nice, too. I think the PC parts shortage is as much, if not a bigger, problem than the limited headsets. If you’re one of the many people who want to upgrade their PC but can’t right now the Quest 2 is a nice compromise for getting into VR.>>><<<AFAIK, Steam tracks if your headset was connected within last month or so.>>><<<People always say it but it sounds really unlikely. Current estimates are like 3 million people on Steam and there's little reason to think it's more than that.>>><<<To be expected honestly, not everyone wants to dish out 1000$ for VR if they are first timers. The Quest 2 is insane value, albeit at the cost of facebook selling your data.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<What do you think selling your data means... it means you get hit with ads so you buy more shit. It also means that they are going to do everything they can to add more ads to everything they can. Even if you do not buy things from the ads your experience will suffer. 

IMDB tv is a free service with ads. Netflix no ads. Which experience is better?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<~~remeber cambridge analytica?~~

facebook has sold userdata in the past. not just personalised advertisement, they actively and directly sold the data. according to some sources data that wasn't anonymised. there is no reason to assume meta won't do the same in the future. we don't even know if they ever stopped.

this *is* a privacy issue. of course what makes the situation even worse, is that a company like meta is getting more and more controll over the vr market. a single company shouldn't have this kind of controll and especially not a company with metas policies.

this shit needs to be regulated and we urgently need privacy respecting opensource operating systems for headsets. especially for the enclosed oculus headsets>>><<<Cambridge analytics didn't buy data from Facebook... They exploited the Facebook api to get user info for free by getting people to install random apps. I haven't seen a single instance of Facebook profiting from selling user data.>>><<<For the most part, though, Facebook has positioned itself as the new Cambridge Analytica. That's why they're less inclined to sell the data now. (As an aside, Cambridge Analytica technically exploited a loophole in Facebook's data access system--they weren't supposed to be able to get as much data as they did under Facebook's terms. Of course, that's pretty academic given that they did get the data.)

But Facebook got out of selling user data because they now instead do user modeling. So, if you want to, say, sell plane tickets for Las Vegas to bipolar users who are just entering a manic phase, you pay Facebook to target those users. Facebook is now a central clearinghouse for psychological manipulation for advertising. It's also why they've been so effective at destroying US democracy.

So yeah. Selling data is an issue, but what Facebook is up to these days is maybe worse.>>><<<thanks, very insightful. i agree with most now

&gt;it's why they've been so effective at destroying US democracy.

what democracy? the USA are a two party state. voters have the choice between neo-liberals (right) and conservative fascists (far right). to even become canditate for presidency you have to be rich and need the support of various companies. the voting system through representatives is indirect and if you want already undemocratic on it's own. the administration of certain presidents is making harder for certain groups to vote. it's the illusion of a democracy. 

sorry for that rant>>><<<Fair enough. There were remnants of democracy, but you're right, it was really more a plutocracy. We're rapidly headed for a plutocrat-funded autocracy, though, which is, y'know, still worse.>>><<<&gt;remeber cambridge analytica?

You mean the case where data was *stolen* from Facebook and then sold? You mean the case where a research team exploited an API loophole to collect far more information than they were allowed and then refused to delete the data when Facebook found out, only to sell it to Cambridge Analytica? You mean that case?

Facebook has never sold data. That is like saying that Coca-Cola sells their recipe.>>><<<Makes sense. I've just seen similar arguments with the intent to disregard what is happening. Like "well, if they aren't actually selling my data then this is all ok.">>><<<&gt; What do you think selling your data means

Probably that they sell your data.

AKA companies buy it, then get it.

You know, like when you say "this shop sells milk", doesn't mean "this shop lets other people use the milk without acquiring the milk".>>><<<&gt; What do you think selling your data means

Selling data = selling data. Using data to target you with ads is not selling your data. It’s no different to how Google uses your search history to target ads at you.>>><<<So they sell you.>>><<<the data is less of an issue. i mean yes, ~~facebook~~ meta has at trackrecord of mishandling user data without any moral concerns what so ever, which definitely makes them worse in that area, than most (if not all) other vr companies.

the real issue though, is that meta is building it's monopoly on the standalone vr market, preventing anyone from even becoming a competitor, that meta is buying up vr game studios, with the goal or at least capability of making everything meta exclusive in the future, and meta trying and (judging from how the rest is going so far) probably succeeding to make the meta's verse and thereby the future of vr and societies, their own thing.

right now not much bad will happen to you for using oculus devices. you are just supporting meta ont heir way towards a dark dystopian future.

we need government regulations on that shit and less enclosed or even opensource operating systems for headsets as well as an actually publicly controlled metaverse/nexus.>>><<<The problem isn't the account attached, it's the future attached. People act like they're not helping their platform, then go and demand youtubers talk about the quest, that devs port to it, and that people buy their headsets.>>><<<I just tried upgrading my CV1 to a Reverb G2 and what I've found is the steam VR and WMR software just isn't up to the level of Oculus when it comes to stability and performance (IE things like vector smoothing vs time warp etc.) If Facebook put out a desktop level headset to replace the Rift S with high res and FOV I would've probably gotten it. My CV1 has been fantastic for years.>>><<<Selling your soul for a desire, serving humanity since biblical times.>>><<<Microsoft will never really compete until it is too late. I have many family members over 70 loving the Quest 2. They are not computer literate and they find using the Quest easy. They will never use a PC for vr.>>><<<Thanks to Valve for making Steamvr an open platform unlike Facbook/meta/oculus and their closed setup.>>><<<Can you elaborate? What's so open about SteamVR ?>>><<<It allows any headset to run through it and valve puts development effort into making various headset platforms compatible with steamsvr apis. In comparison oculus has a bunch of exclusive games that can only be played through their store. The quest is even more restricted not even making its games available to rift users through the oculus store (which should be relatively trivial for them to do if they cared).>>><<<It's important to remember that a lot of the headsets being used on PC aren't even being used on Steam - a lot of users play exclusively via Oculus' PCVR platform. As far as just the Steam ecosystem, yeah, pretty crazy.>>><<<&gt; a lot of users play exclusively via Oculus' PCVR platform.

I am calling bullshit. If you are doing PCVR, why would you limit your self to the Oculus store? I am willing to bet that less than 1% of Oculus PCVR users only buy from the Oculus store.>>><<<Consider that there's a fairly large number of occlus users who don't have a gaming PC at all.>>><<<What does that have to do with anything? This is about PCVR, not MobileVR.

Anyone who is paying attention knows that by the holidays, MobileVR will be 4 to 5 times as big as PCVR.>>><<<Love how many people still use rift s (like me) but oculus barely support it anymore, complete joke>>><<<Sometimes I miss my OG Rift... it feels like a lot of things have gone backwards since then.>>><<<I still use mine.  Resolution is obviously not good at this point, but I still think it's one of the best headsets overall even all these years later.>>><<<Yeah rift s is still the best headset I have ever used as a user with glasses. Affordable yet comfortable, with decent resolution and panel.>>><<<Quest 2 software is also shit don’t worry about feeling left out, they’re only focusing on people who play standalone

I stg none of my cables work properly probably because they want me to buy the official one>>><<<Cries with cv1. Honestly though it's been a great headset but after seeing the fidelity of other headsets it leaves a lot to be desired.>>><<<Great ergonomics, black levels and controllers though.>>><<<My Rift s cable finally died so I decided to get a Quest 2. A benefits of the Rift S is you simply put on the headset and you're in VR if the Oculus app is running. With Quest Link or Air Link, it isn't that fast.

The thing about the Quest 2 Link cable is .. if we choose to use it .. we're tethered to the PC just like with a Rift S. But unlike with a Rift S, we're free to ditch the cable if we go wireless or use native text games and apps. Rift S was more comfortable but Quest 2's more comfortable than Quest 1.>>><<<&gt;My Rift s cable finally died so I decided to get a Quest 2. A benefits of the Rift S is you simply put on the headset and you're in VR if the Oculus app is running. With Quest Link or Air Link, it isn't that fast.

That's why I went from the Rift S to the G2.  My headset is always on and I can just plop it on my head whenever.  I may need to recalibrate my position sometimes but the takes two seconds.>>><<<dont worry quest 2 users will be just like that in a year just like quest 1 owners are left out now,they aint gonna accept psvr 2 platform will look about 20 years more advanced in graphics,game complexity,>>><<<Most Quest users do not use Steam, so the survey is not accurate for the full VR universe.>>><<<The numbers would be even more lopsided then. If you counted *everyone* that uses VR (PC, Standalone and PS), the Quest would **still** be the top dog.>>><<<By a much larger margin.  That's the point he's making.>>><<<Yeah, I agree with OP.>>><<<Given that Oculus is arguably the only consumer-priced headset, should we be surprised?>>><<<No wonder. Vive is pure trash. I need to find a buyer for my Cosmos quick. The headset wouldn't be that bad, but it doesn't support anything and Oculus does anything better while costing less.

With 35 % on Quest 2 I doubt its a bad choice, there should be user hacks if Fakebook becomes too annoying. I don't like it either but its the only affordable headset. I prefer my kidneys staying in SLI, two work better than one.

Also interesting to see a lot of people still use Vive 1. The Cosmos is a new world considering its resolution, which is theoretically better than a Index, but the new headsets supersede that.>>><<<It’s the cheapest choice, thus the most popular.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Wireless alone is a pro point, but overall they also do everything better. If you ever owned a HTC product you know what I mean. HTC even offers upgrade options for the Cosmos, but the wireless is shitty and extremly expensive. They literally charge 200 € for the faceplate (a piece of plastic) and then expect you to get basestations and new controllers because the Cosmos ones don't work with base stations.

Oculus delivers all of that out of the box, a decent resolution, wireless and a topping also a powerful smartphone processor that is included in the package and makes the headset work standalone.>>><<<The Quest 2 also has the ability to hook up to a PC with a USB-C cable. 

The hybrid nature (PCVR/stand alone), and the low price is what made me buy one ($300). And other than some annoying problems on the PCVR side of things, I love this headset.>>><<<Quest 2 is a fuller package in ways, but let's not ignore the shortcuts taken on headset comfort/build quality. Along with accessories breaking.>>><<<I guess it needs some upgrades, but I rather get a cheap headset which I can upgrade than getting an expensive one where I still need to upgrade.>>><<<&gt;shortcuts taken on headset comfort/build quality 

To me, that's a benefit, not a drawback. The barrier for entry needs to be as low as possible, and the industry actually benefits from that.

Also you can upgrade. I don't have all the money to spend at once.>>><<<WMR headsets used to be the cheapest (starting from $99), but they never gained more than 12% market share on Steam.>>><<<That's because they had a garbage service compared to Quest and was wired. And investment and marketing wasn't made in it. 


The VR gaming experience itself was very comparable. But everything else wasn't going for it>>><<<If there was any real competition this could look differently>>><<<I hope to be joining pcvr for the first time soon 👍>>><<<Excited for you!>>><<<Lesgo 5% cv1 gang>>><<<this is really sad>>><<<Also rather inaccurate. The Steam survey doesn't recognize Pimax at all, for instance.

I'm not saying it falls under "other". I'm saying it refused to acknowledge the existence of my 5K+ and 8K X headsets.>>><<<Either way i wouldn't suspect Pimax significantly altering the stats here.>>><<<Fuck Facebook though.>>><<<Meta>>><<<Tbh I'm gonna keep calling them Facebook. Not out of spite, but because it doesn't hide the history of the name.>>><<<Untill there's more stuff not related under the facebook brand, it's still all Facebook>>><<<It's honestly just the price and lack of needing sensor boxes I imagine. I hardly use the actual desktop oculus if ever and I only have two games on the actual headset.>>><<<You forgot it's wireless. That's a huge benefit of using a Quest.>>><<<Yep. Anyone who comes out with a wireless to desktop like I use this, with better screen, for even $100 more and I'll do it if it's good.>>><<<I bought my Samsung Odyssey+ in 2020 and still have absolutely no reason to switch to a different headset. I do, however, enjoy when my friends bring over an oculus quest 2 and we can enjoy a VR experience together>>><<<Ngl, the valve index makes up a lot more than expected, especially since the vive has been around for so long>>><<<Can't get an Index in my country and HTC is ludicrously expensive.
No wonder Oculus is ahead>>><<<Also the fact that you can use the Quest 2 in both PCVR (with a USB-C cable) or stand alone mode, for as low as $300. 

I knew they'd be ahead when I heard that price tag.>>><<<&gt; Also the fact that you can use the Quest 2 in both PCVR (with a USB-C cable) 

You don't need a cable if you have a half-way decent router for [AirLink](https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-air-link-a-wireless-way-to-play-pc-vr-games-on-oculus-quest-2-plus-infinite-office-updates-support-for-120-hz-on-quest-2-and-more/)>>><<<Well no shit, the Quest 2 is 300 USD and pretty good, and the next competitor costs 3-4 times as much and isn't remotely 3-4 times better. I can talk my buddies into spending 300 USD to join me in VR, but 1000+? That's a god damn hard sale, let me tell you.

This is why I keep saying that Valve needed to make a cheap-o inside-out versions of the Index. By all means, make the Deckard, but make a affordable headset too otherwise this kind of thing happens.

ALL my friends except one took one look at Facebook and balked at the idea. Then they looked at the prices of alternatives and balked again.>>><<<Still dont understand why oculus dropped support for the second largest headset on PC>>><<<Because Quest 2 does everything Rift does and it simplifies their support structure. Instead of trying to figure solutions for two headsets that operate differently, they can just focus on one.>>><<<Because Oculus Quest 2 - in just a few months on the market - has outsold not just Lenovo Rift S, but all of its predecessors combined.>>><<< Cos other companies are retarded as fuck. Giving facecrap free monopoly and cry afterwards about how they cant catch up anymore. Fuck all other companies. Don’t care anymore and it’s to late.>>><<<True story.>>><<<Where the hell is psvr? Wasn't like the best seller for several months before oculus became popular??>>><<<PSVR users are like 2% of SteamVR users. And I don't know how they're that high, considering there's not support.

This is a SteamVR chart, not a VR market chart.>>><<<Ohhh my bad then>>><<<People play on Steam with PSVR headsets?>>><<<Damn, Reverb G2 ain’t even on the board...I wonder how big a part of “other” they make up.>>><<<Is there any actual technical reason to get any of the Oculus headsets though? Especially when it comes to controllers and tracking fidelity.

It just seems to me that those models pander to very casual uses that pale in comparison to the more precise input and output gear.>>><<<Inside out tracking of controllers is better than on WMR or cosmos. Touch controllers for me are the most ergonomic. The FOV is narrower than pretty much everything else but not by a wide margin (aside from pimax).

Wireless PCVR on standalones is pretty good. I also like the sharpness and wide sweetspot.

So there are reasons aside from cost and care for UX(failing with Rift S quite a bit with that) 

But they do have their cons. The inexplicable push for not great audio solution. Requirement of facebook account. etc.

So some things are really good but they do target lower budget. But don't be fooled by the price. Others have some margins to make profit off the hardware. While margins on quest hardware is near 0. So comparing dollar to dollar of value is not entirely accurate metric.

Personally I own quite few oculus HMDs. But played around with index, vive. I also have Reverb G2 And I find myself gravitating towards Q2 even for PCVR and G2 gets relegated mostly too space/flight/racing sims. 

For me with index bright artefacts were a bit distracting (but my brain mainly ignored them after a while) The sharpness was hard to dial in so it would be sharp across the FOV but the fov was noticeably bigger. Nothing major as my brain tends to ignore narrower FOV after a while. I really like Eye relief adjustment and audio on index and audio on reverb. But I liked Rift CV1 audio solution as well.

The biggest disappointment when it comes to index were resolution and controllers. I probably got overhyped waiting for them. And I love that it has a strap and ton of inputs that even when not entirely functional within games are immersion multipliers. But they were never comfortable for me. While touch melts into my hand (especially CV1).

When I played wired on CV1  headset cable never really bothered me all that much. Yes it tangled and rested on my back etc. But when I play now with Quest I readily trade visual fidelity for wireless PCVR. 

Wireless PCVR without specialised hardware is pretty good.>>><<<Primarily value for the dollar. Nothing comes close to the Quest when it comes to what you get for the price.

Oculus Insight tracking is every bit as accurate as the HTC/Vive tracking, you just can't keep your hands out of the FOV of the cameras for more than a couple seconds at a time. For most people that does not matter, but depending on what you want to do in VR it could be make the Quest or any thing head-set-camera-tracked controllers a no go.>>><<<That’s why I said technical and not financial reasons. Like, I’m all for getting value for money but I’m also way more concerned about quality of the product you get. It’s no use saving money if you get a substantially lesser quality of experience for it.

Like, I doubt anything that does the inside-out tracking is ever going to support Full-Body Tracking. Or even just being able to reach behind your own head. Good fidelity is important for immersion, even if you’re just playing games where your hands are in view all the time.>>><<<No WMR? my Samsung odyssey + still going strong (wish devs wouldn’t break compatibility with it tho)>>><<<Yep. Turns out cost and availability are winners.>>><<<And yet even bringing it up on this sub in a vaguely positive light makes people react like you just told someone to get the plague>>><<<yeah, truly a sad momentary state for VR.>>><<<if you want to feel really sad, just realize most Oculus Quest users don't connect to pc or even have no VR-ready pc, which is exactly why they went with a Quest.>>><<<IDK, i bought a Quest 2 to use it with AirLink and SteamVR, but yea, I'd be curious to see how many will stick to the Evil Guy ecosystem.>>><<<I just can't afford a high end PC, nor can I afford to update it down the road.>>><<<I get that point, what I don't like is the whole invasive and exclusive development ecosystem from Facebook and their general villain approach on user data, privacy and bias exploiting social engineering.>>><<<I don't either, but there's not exactly other optio s for low I come gamers who want to try VR. If Valve, and HTC and these other companies make something then I will buy it.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Hey Thanks for reposting my Pie Chart! Super cool!

I will have more charts coming soon!>>><<<I hate this.

As affordable as the Oculus devices are, FB shouldn't be the ones leading this market. Wish it was never sold to them. It's only a matter of time before they ruin it with their whole 'Metaverse' bullshit.>>><<<I predict they will fail with the Metaverse.>>><<<Terrifying>>><<<Can't believe there are people willing to defend Facebook. Really says a lot about consumers. Bring a product to the market that people desire and can afford and bam, suddenly they're not so Bad anymore.>>><<<Well of course they do, they're easily the most cost-effective options. Sad to say, most people can't afford to spend double or more than double just for the sake of their morals>>><<<It’s not about morals, it’s about us all being fucked soon.>>><<<Still using my rift.>>><<<Still using my Rift CV1.>>><<<Yes, it's going to be a monopoly>>><<<Regardless, they're still not the best hmd on the market. I feel ashamed for downgrading to this perfectly capable extension of zuck myself.>>><<<I don't mind the quest (I'm mostly PCVR but I do own a quest), but I really dislike a lot of the Quest community. When it comes down to it.. a lot of the people using quests are children.. and as such.. a lot of them are toxic. When you go into a multiplayer vr game that is just PCVR you don't really get that toxicity>>><<<Classic sell product for loss for market share scheme going on here.>>><<<wtf General Mills doesn't have a headset.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<They are the best.

What do you expect?>>><<<When Meta disables SteamVR compatibility, Index will become the most widely used VR headset on Steam! :)>>><<<why would they do that? The quest originally didn't support it, fb added support later. I would say that it would be more likely a future headset doesn't support it, because they would piss off current quest 2 owners.>>><<<Lol delusional>>><<<They won’t, that would make people look for another headset to play Alyx. This is the easiest way to kill off SteamVR.>>><<<25% of all headsets were completely abandoned by those fucks at oculus/Facebook.>>><<<That's sad.>>><<<*Meta

lol>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<If you ever felt like trying a Vive, you could get one at a decent price. 

It can also be an upgrade path to an Index. **I know it's not recommended by most (understandably), but it's an option that exists.**>>><<<Happy to see the quest 2 do so well, still using my trusty Rift S though>>><<<This is only because nobody else is really competing.  Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, Dell, Asus...who else?

All of these companies got out once they determined that it's not worth it.   There's no money in it.  They're better off making laptops or monitors.  Basically anything other than niche VR headsets.

This is before the Quest even came along so
 It's not like they were forced out they just looked at the numbers and realised that there's no money in it.

So with Facebook having 60% of the market I'm not sure if winning the race to the bottom is necessarily something to be proud of.>>><<<&gt; So with Facebook having 60% of the market I'm not sure if winning the race to the bottom is necessarily something to be proud of.

So they should not be proud of the Q2? A device that gives you 6DOF MobileVR or streamed PCVR for $299, and has sold 4x as many units, and brought 4x as many people to VR than all of PCVR combined did in 6+ years?

I think I would be pretty proud of that.>>><<<Well I'm pretty sure they're losing money on VR.  Losing money is not that hard so anyone willing to lose money could probably do the same thing.>>><<<*Reality Labs* is funded by *Meta* for a lot of different stuff besides their VR hardware. That pays for most of the R&amp;D, and it is likley that the 30% they make off the store easily coverys everyting else.

For just the production costs, I think tthe 128GB version is sold at a small lost and that they make a pretty good margin on the 256GB version.   They certainly make a good margin on their 1st party accessories.>>><<<Great visual that tells you all the key info.

If this was on a tech blog, it would’ve been surrounded by paragraphs of buildup and redundant text.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Yes it's accurate. If you are paranoid about the Oculus device being listed first, it seems to be in order of price. We don't have a price for Santa Cruz yet, but people are guessing around $500.>>><<<So I hear, but I don't know how you could express bias with blunt specifications, short of straight-up lying about what they were.>>><<<Too many storefronts, I wish companies would stop doing this>>><<<They're all trying to be the new Apple app store.

The stores will consolidate once the buyers focus on one or two.>>><<<I just really *really* hope they don't become the App Store and start selling super cheap titles en masse till the market becomes flooded and entirely unusable

It needs to be more like Steam.>>><<<Steam is a monopoly when it comes to non-VR, we don't want a monopoly in standalone VR (thank goodness Oculus is on PC and has competed equally with Steam).

The best thing for consumers and competition would be for 2 stores to dominate.

Enough for competition, but not too many that it's hard to switch.>>><<<If Steam is trying to be a monopoly, they are doing a really bad job at it. Oculus on the other hand is focusing on trying to create a monopoly with anti-consumer tactics, but they are worse at that than Steam is at trying to be a monopoly.>>><<<Steam is literally a monopoly when it comes to non-VR PC gaming, by the definition of almost all regulators.>>><<<You have no clue what a monopolistic action is, nor what a monopoly is. Can you only by computer games from Steam? I would love to hear your definition of a monopoly as it's not the same as everyone else on the planet.>>><<<Every regulator in Europe defines a monopoly as "when only 1 company has over 25% of a particular market".

Steam is the only PC non-VR gaming store with more than 25% market share.

I'm sure America's definition is similar.>>><<<*facepalm* That's not the definition of a monopoly. Please show me where you get your information from? Pulling it out of your ass doesn't count.>>><<<Yes, it literally is.

You seem to not know the difference between a monopoly and a pure monopoly.>>><<<So by your definition. Oculus too is a monopoly. They own 85% of mobile and ~50% of PC VR>>><<<They're a monopoly in the mobile market right now, but not in PC, because monopoly legally requires you to be the ***only*** company with &gt;25%.

HTC also has around 47% of the PC market, so no, it's defined as a duopoly right now.>>><<<Oculus is trying to create a console like ecosystem on the PC space so I don't share your (thank goodness Oculus is on PC), if Oculus just created a storefront that was open to all I would agree with you, but until then I think Oculus is poisoning the PC space and VR>>><<<Well, even in the standalone VR market, Oculus is bringing up the rear of resolution.>>><<<Like Netflix and Hulu. I just get both so if something isn't on one, it's usually on the other.>>><<<Would be a lot nicer if both stores offered the same content so you could choose the overall better store instead of just the content on it.

With the way Oculus is doing business, you would need entirely separate hardware to support your Netflix/Hulu subscription.>>><<<Good point. It's pretty annoying how shows and movies are exclusive to only one app. Like when something is on Amazon Prime or HBO, I'm not going to sign up for a new service just to watch one show. 

Exclusives are such a shitty way of doing business.>>><<<That's the way **all** the above OEMs except Pico are doing business.>>><<<So I can buy anything off the oculus store and use it with any VR headset? Learn to read what I type>>><<<* What you buy on VivePort can only be used on Vive Focus and Pico Neo

* What you buy on Pico Store can only be used on Goblin and Neo

* What you buy on DayDream can only be used on DayDream View and Mirage Solo

* What you buy on Oculus can only be used on Gear VR, Go, and Santa Cruz

What's the difference...?

Learn the market you're talking about before injecting your opinion.>>><<<You forgot steam? Why focus on the companies with anti-consumer actions?>>><<<Exactly, or Android and iPhone. Google Home and Amazon Alexa. Waymo and Cruise. PlayStation and Xbox.

Innovate hard to compete with eachother.>>><<<Not fully though. If we had all in one, it would be great. But it will most likely end up like it did with online DRM, we'll have Steam and them some smaller ones which are mainly just for one publisher like Origin or Uplay.>>><<<Only if they're clearly above competition, be it DRM-less policy or separate, customer friendly pricing in $ and €. Hehe, it kinda reminds me of GoG galaxy; they don't happen to have their own storefront, do they? /s>>><<<Nobody wants to be the first to start using someone else's. It'll sort itself out when enough consumers enter the field and basically choose for the companies.>>><<<This is how all new markets start. The big money is all in the storefronts, not in the hardware itself.

Every OEM with the ability to do so will try to get their own platform out there.

Over time, consumer preferences will bring it down to 2 winners (like the mobile market with iOS and Android, or AI market with Google Assistant and Alexa), and the other OEMs will make hardware for those platforms.

If I had to guess, I'd say it'll be Oculus and DayDream- with HTC and Pico changing to the latter in around 3 years.>>><<<I just wish it was not the case, it is just bad for the consumers to be locked into a certain ecosystem, that's the main reason I moved away from consoles to PC, personally I don't really have much interest in standalone VR, but I was thinking of getting one just for porn, but now with all these storefronts it's just put me right off  >>><<<It won't be the case in 5 years.

The same thing happened in the mobile market.

There was iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Symbian, and some others.

In the end, it's just iOS and Android.

Porn runs on WebVR mostly, which is cross-platform. WebVR may be the saviour in this perspective actually.>>><<<I hope you are right, it's just a shame it will take that long>>><<<So what are the odds we see steam better support the rift and the oculus store supporting the vive in the future? >>><<<I'm not talking about PC, I'm talking about mobile &amp; standalone.

By the time Oculus Store supports non-Oculus systems, HTC probably won't exist in the market.>>><<<Oculus is likely to go first. Facebook has to be getting fed up with all the fumbles, and they keep shedding people.

CV1 going to be the first and last of the consumer PC line?>>><<<You're delusional.

Oculus is growing every year, it has over 1500 people working for it now.

Oculus owns &gt;50% of the PC market and &gt;85% of the mobile market.>>><<<That $199 will probably jump out at many average consumers. The following is a VR statistic that showed what happened in 2016 ..

"Greenlight VR survey reveals U.S. consumers are most interested in using virtual reality for travel, entertainment, events, home design and education"

In fact the title of the article is "VR Survey: More interest in travel, videos than gaming"

If 2017-2018 stats are similar and  Facebook knows these stats, they might release products accordingly. They may assume that most of the people they're interested in, "Facebook users," may spend more time performing non-gaming activities, such as watching videos and interacting socially in VR as avatars. There's an article called "Why is Oculus releasing so many different types of headsets." If everybody was a gamer, maybe the Oculus GO might now exist. 

Gamers and companies with business use cases and me will probably prefer "real VR," which today costs more than $199. 

Here's a 2017 stat compiled by the Greenlight research firm ..

"Two-Thirds of U.S. Consumers Are Interested in Social VR"

https://greenlightinsights.com/2017-consumer-report-released/

__EXCERPT

“Virtual reality has always been more than a medium for gaming experiences and technology savvy consumers are quickly learning that,” Erica Bishaf, Research Director for Greenlight Insights. “Our findings from multiple studies suggest that some platforms in the VR ecosystem may be overly focused on gaming. The reality is that consumers have a wide variety of interests for using virtual reality, including creative expression. Platform and content providers would be wise to consider these bigger, richer findings as they develop their content and marketing strategies.”

 .
So if Facebook is shooting for social VR and Microsoft, by its own admission, is shooting for social vr, maybe a $199 Oculus GO or a $230 Acer running on a low-powered non-Ultra laptop may satisfy a lot of the world's consumers. They GO users may never get to try positional tracking, but for many of them, that may not matter if stats about usage trends are correct. They won't need positional tracking to watch a VR video while riding on a plane or meet a friend in a VR theater to watch a movie.

 They won't even need a phone if they get one of those all-in-one headsets. $199 and you're in the club. Someone's grandmother may not care too much about Fallout 4, but she might like to meet her grand daughter in a Facebook room and hang out as an avatar. 
 >>><<<The Lenovo one so far looks like the best bang for your buck with both positional tracking and accessible pricing.

That is unless Santa Cruz stays in the same price-range but also adds positional tracking on the controllers as well, although I feel more like it'll hover around the price range of the Vive Focus, in which case it'll be a choice between higher visual fidelity or positional tracking of the controllers.>>><<<There are other factors to consider imo. Which advantages does a 6DOF headset with 3DOF controllers have compared to both 3DOF in real life? And which will have the most compelling content?

The Oculus Store should be well above Daydream right now. The Lenovo is price/hardware wise definitely attractive though.

Effectively you pay double for 6DOF tracking compared to the Go.>>><<<From my personal experience I find 3DOF visuals to be extremely jarring so I wouldn't want anything with 3DOF on the screen even for half the price, even on a simple "theater" app where you effectively watch a 2D screen in front of you that gjves you the effect of being 30ft tall, having said screen follow my back &amp; forth head movement all the time instead of sticking to it's spatial position makes me feel very uncomfortable, but that might just be my personal problem.

As for the controller being 3DOF only it doesn't feel as bad as you'll most likely only use it as a pointer or as a regular "gamepad" in those use cases, however for sure if that was also 6DOF it'd open up an entire new world of possible application.>>><<<Good luck to all, they are going to sell 10 units. >>><<<What makes you think that?>>><<<Too many players for a niche market. Standalone will only be successful with an AR implementation. GearsVR had a limited success and that was free, I don't see how they expect people to pay $300 to play mobile phone games.>>><<<Gear VR was $99 and has had *huge* success.

The most reviewed VR-only games on Oculus PC and Steam have around 5K reviews.

The highest rated Gear VR apps have 50K, 60K, 70K reviews.

10x the active userbase of PC VR.

---

Standalone will dwarf the PC market. **PC** is the niche.>>><<<This is a sad truth.

It's very disappointing as everyone i have talked to about VR that doesn't own a rift or vive has been very turned off by mobile and stand alone VR.

Honestly without full positional tracking for the headset and controllers what is the point?>>><<<&gt; $99

Sorry, I have it for free, like almost everybody I know, and yes, keep dreaming, every five years or so comes some genius declaring the death of the PC.>>><<<Go look at the Amazon sales figures. It outsells all the others there.

I didn't say PC was dead, I just said it will remain niche for VR.>>><<<Can you provide a source for that? [Vive beats GearVR in this category](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Wearable-Tech-Virtual-Reality-Gear/zgbs/electronics/14775003011/ref=zg_bs_nav_e_2_10048700011)

And we know that the Rift is a good chunk above the Vive.>>><<<Eenie meenie miney mo>>><<<santa cruz is stand alone? I thought its connected to pc>>><<<Has never been that way.>>><<<Nope, fully standalone, doesn't connect to a PC.>>><<<Here are my **musts** for a standalone system.  Headset positional tracking, controller positional tracking, and SteamVR.

VR will go mainstream once you get the full package in a standalone system that can play some cool games on its own.  I just hope we're not "ahead of our time".>>><<<SteamVR is PC-only, it doesn't run on standalone OSs or SoCs.

Of the mobile/standalone platforms right now, Oculus has the highest quality *and* quantity of content, so replace SteamVR in your list with Oculus and you have it.>>><<<Oculus is only interested in creating a walled off ecosystem, I would not buy from them just for that reason, then you have to consider the data it wants to mine of you>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<The Google one is the Lenovo one, unless you mean something unknown.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<3DoF or 6DoF?>>><<<what ...why wouldn't they announce that ...they were pretty open about the all in one headsets they wanted to bring to market ...although the deal with htc didn't work out
>>><<<And all of them will fade into obscurity, damaging vr in general due to their unique programming requirements and store fronts. Software drives adoption and being open and abstracted is the answer. All of these standalone devices could have added a pc interface and openvr and then would have universal value. >>><<<So I guess Nintendo needs to come out with one? Just imagine if all the headsets currently out didn't need distortion correction or handled it in the hardware and accepted any HDMI input.>>><<<literally all of the distortion correction could be done by a Signal Processor inside the headset. All a game engine has to do is output two stereo images via OpenVR. Writing a driver for OpenVR is child's play, so much so that four separate developers are adding in "unsupported" headsets as we speak that have all the capabilities of the vive, and that includes things like a gear vr from your mobile phone. There's no excuse except greed - but the funny part is they'll actually LOSE MONEY this way. 

PSVR since it has an hdmi port can be used as a "vive". 

Windows MR headsets have seen TREMENDOUS success even though there's so many options - and I would go on record to say that is entirely due to SteamVR (and by proxy, that also means oculus home via librevr) cross compatibility. 

The funny thing is windows MR is a walled garden too! BUT: it's got some great stuff! I wouldn't have even cared to check it out if it didn't have support for OpenVR though - microsoft was very smart to add that to their platform and these other hardware developers need to follow their lead.>>><<<u can also add ......integrated audio and the integrated storage amount and sd card option>>><<<If you’re looking for one of these, the Lenovo seems like a good bet.

Great upgrade to push to clients over basic mobile VR for sure. Once you add in the cost of a phone then GearVR isn’t terribly cheap anyway >>><<<Almost everyone who buys a Gear VR already has the phone though.>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Because it's only releasing that headset in china>>><<<Hi mate, did you do this lineup with the wired ones also? Thx!>>><<<Yes, but since they are all so similar it required a more detailed perspective, as tables rather than a chart: https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/wiki/pcvrcomparison

###EDIT: [here's an attempt](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWwrwk_WAAA0EbH.png)>>><<<Nice to see the officially playspace for the Rift changed>>><<<Someone has changed the officially playspace for the Rift from 8.2ftx8.2ft to 3mx3m which is 9.8ft which is not the correct officially playspace for the Rift, so I have just changed it to 2.5mx2.5 which is 8.2ft.

Here is a [link from the Oculus website](https://www.oculus.com/blog/oculus-roomscale-tips-for-setting-up-a-killer-vr-room/) which does state 8ft is recommeded, if you don't want to read all that here is the [section that is important](https://imgur.com/a/v7Tha) I know the .2ft is extra, but I thought I would just round it up just for you, haha>>><<<Does anyone like their daydream? Thinking of buying one, had a Vive before. >>><<<DayDream View is very different from Mirage Solo.

Mirage Solo has positional tracking whereas DayDream View does not.>>><<<Comfy headset. Scant content.>>><<<It's a solid 6/10>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<None of the Windows MR headsets except the Samsung one have variable IPD. Nor does PSVR.

Are they failures too?>>><<<yes, your asking for market failure if your device causes eye strain>>><<<OK well PSVR has outsold all other 6DoF headsets *combined* by like 2x, so no, you're wrong.>>><<<and vrgear out sold those and google cardboard has outsold both of those. attach rate and play time is where the important numbers are for long term success>>><<<And only one has an OLED screen which makes a huge difference in VR>>><<<I personally will never use any of these products, but recognise the market potential, so once there are blockchains designed for these services I will gladly contribute to their uptake and profit as a result.>>><<<Why are they doing this? Energy limits and heat dissipation necessarily gimp any such tiny computer just as they do in mobile phones and other small platforms. And it's so much worse for something as demanding as VR. They'll thermal throttle within tens of minutes.

I consider each and every one of these to be 1 of 2 things: a scam, or a porn/video headset.>>><<<You know all those times you see GearVR being used for small experiences and marketing materials where lugging a PC around isn’t viable?

Yeah. This would be a massive step up and probably cheaper >>><<<All those times I see gear VR used for marketing material... Honestly only once at a big data conference and I skipped it. I see the potential for these stand alone devices in 3-4 years and as much as I hate saying it, apple will be the one to pull it off (for ones not tied to desktop GPUs - those will strive bc of gaming). So none of these devices excites me... Yet. 
Don't get me wrong I'd love to be proven wrong about the apple part but I'm pretty confident in the 3-4 years part. Mostly bc I used daydream with my note 8 and I returned it after 45 mins and I was super excited for it. I mostly wanted it for casual use to, like watching a movie on a plane, and it just wasn't a great experience. I think it will get there, just not with the next round of mobile chips and tech.>>><<<&gt;Why are they doing this?

Because the vast, vast majority of people don't own a gaming PC and don't want to pay $800 *on top of* a PC VR system just to use VR.>>><<<I strongly disagree. Most people who try mobile VR never want to go near it again. And most people who have tried PC VR don't count mobile solutions as VR. 

It's honestly an insult to the term Virtual Reality.>>><<<&gt;Most people who try mobile VR never want to go near it again

This is just nonsense.

Go and read the top helpful Amazon and Best Buy reviews for the current Gear VR. You'll be shocked at how wrong you are.>>><<<I see a lot of 5s and a lot of 1s. That tells me all I need to know. Or it would, if GearVR were a single thing instead of a lot of different things depending on which smart phone you use.>>><<<Again, go back and **read the top helpful reviews**.

I see averages of higher than 4.5 and overall excellent reviews.>>><<<If you have to bias filter the reviews to show what you want it's kind of pointless. But then again, so is this whole comment thread now that I've noticed who I'm replying to.

You're the baghdad bob of VR.>>><<<Again, I'm not touching the filter. I'm just scrolling down to the reviews and **actually reading them**.>>><<<Then read the 1 star reviews as well.

You are extremely biased.>>><<<I have spoken to well over 70 people about it in person. Every single one has been disappointed and put off of VR from mobile "VR" 

Maybe some people like it, but as a VR game developer i have yet to meet one in person.>>><<<This guy will be here for us after ww3>>><<<So…next Thursday then?>>><<<RIP Ukraine.>>><<<Happy cake day>>><<<you are the second person I've seen today with the same cake day, happy cake day 👍>>><<<Thanks, you’ll wish him a happy cake day too !>>><<<Happy cake day>>><<<Hey, I saw a couple of negative comments and I just wanna say, good job on taking some steps on making something! It takes a lot of courage to try something new and unique, and I’m sure lots of folks are proud of you :)>>><<<I think a lot were made in good jest. Scrolling through their post history, they like to tinker. Properly honed and harnessed, could lead to a career or just amazing pieces of work.>>><<<...and big projects start very modest - like a cut up plastic fish bowl.  It's about iteration:

https://kguttag.com/2021/02/04/mira-from-20-fishbowl-to-new-mario-kart-ride-at-universal-japan-in-about-4-years/>>><<<Oh man, iteration is key.

Near the beginning of mandated mask our company sourced out homemade masks, but the straps weren't adjustable or elastic so they would fold our ears in and they got real sore real quick.

I had already seen a few behind-the-head strap holders out there, so I decided to model my own just for kicks. It was a rectangle shaped bar with three pairs of hooks placed on each side for adjustability. The first iteration was too thick so it couldn't flex, wildly uncomfortable so I thinned it. Then I added curves to more comfortably rest against the back of the skull, but it still wasn't good enough.

It was meant to be used with hardhats but it sort of got in the way of the tightener knob on the back and was annoying to put on. Then I realized I could split the two sides and make them clips that attached directly to the hardhat liner. I had people providing feedback through the whole process as I was testing, I swear I've never looked at so many dudes ears up close in my life. Big ears, small ears, further back, closer to the eyes, higher, lower. I ended up dropping the two sets of hooks on each side, only keeping one set per clip. I adjusted the angle and made it wider to help mitigate wear on the top if the ear, and turned them into five sizes and sold them for $5 a pair. I made enough for a couple rolls of filament and learned a ton in the process. It was a great experience.>>><<<This is great advice that more people need to hear.   Iteration is the means and methods of innovation.>>><<<That was a fun read! Fascinating stuff.>>><<<They're just joking. I doubt anybody is seriously hating on a dude for creating his own headset>>><<<Indeed>>><<<The world needs more people like you>>><<<Creation is one of my biggest sources of joy and happiness, I recommend everyone to go out there and try to create something, especially when you are feeling kinda down.>>><<<Nicest redditor>>><<<I once made a gas mask out of an asthma inhaler, a medical face mask and a  plastic sandwich bag.

Didn’t work, but had a lot of fun making it lol>>><<<looks like it has face and eye tracking, built in tracking, and a holographic display! truly the future>>><<<Looks like two LCDs meant to reflect off safety glasses? How’s well does it work?>>><<<Yeah but not how it was meant>>><<<How did you do it?>>><<<Probably better bang for my buck with this compared to the quest pro.>>><<<Does it work, or?>>><<<My guess is no>>><<<Wrong, it’s working but I still need to make an OS for this>>><<<I propose calling it VOS is DOS (a play on the German “was ist das”
meaning “What is this?” and Virtual OS and the OG MS-DOS platform)>>><<<Congrats! Are you planning to core with something existant or go from scratch?>>><<<are you going to make a video about how you made it and how it works? Because this is actually pretty cool>>><<<Wat>>><<<You try making one please>>><<<The people sitting here saying this is stupid have never done anything other than watch YouTube and Reddit for the next thing they tell you to buy.>>><<<I used to use meth too.>>><<<Adderall was my immediate thought>>><<<May be a generational thing. Wikipedia does have an interesting article on Adderall. Will give it a skim today.>>><<<With enough caffeine I could recreate around 50% of what OP made with this>>><<<I 100% agree. This was also my first thought.>>><<<I still do, but I used to, too>>><<<Yooo it's the Quest ->>><<<Quest 1/2>>><<<How good is the display projection?>>><<<for a second I thought he still needed lenses but I just figured out that the displays are projected on the goggles!>>><<<It’s not quite good but still interesting result>>><<<Looks like Reality Goggles. 


Jokes aside, looks really cool and I love the idea of having a HUD!


I think you're on to something here, keep it up!>>><<<Google Cardboard Pro>>><<<Did you use a plumbus with it or no?>>><<<Was that a Rick and Morty reference I sensed?>>><<<Perhaps>>><<<🤣 definitely also I have no idea why I was downvoted say I know this is a bit off topic but did you ever see the episode where they show how plmbus are made?>>><<<Idk either and yeah why>>><<<Just curious mostly cause you know what a plumbus is🤣 but yeah Reddit is weird like that>>><<<what>>><<<Wow, you are super talented dude! I wish I had someone to do these interesting projects with, good luck with the development, keep us updated!>>><<<Well surely it's better than HTC's next headset.>>><<<Yep, already got higher specs and we don’t even know it>>><<<Yeah this is THC's next headset>>><<<Cool project!>>><<<looks like two composite (maybe?) displays pointing at a semi-clear pair of work glasses. 

So, this could sort of work ... You need to reverse the image before sending it to the display, which is easily done in software. 

I'm guessing these are lower than 320x240 resolution, which is pretty abysmal, but it's okay if all you're doing is emulating the age of computers/game from before HD TVs were a thing. 

I'm curious to know more.>>><<<I was at Quakecon 2012, or maybe it was 2013, when they were giving super secret rift demos. It was literally a ski mask with a smartphone screen strapped on. This might actually be more sophisticated. This is how it starts. Well done!>>><<<Ah I think I remember that it was the prototype before the um refinement>>><<<That's awesome you got to see the early rift prototype. This reminded me of that as well. Still crazy to think some kid in a forum just up and decided to make VR and here we are today. Shame the story of oculus and palmer ended the way it did with him being forgotten and kind of a douche. Oculus was the most exciting company in tech for a long time. We have so few stories now of solo people at their house out-designing huge tech companies.>>><<<LOL

does it work? or is this just a "built this while trippin and have no idea what it does nor do I want to" moment>>><<<I want to know that but I feel I already know the answer.>>><<<I can't tell if this is a shit post or not>>><<<A shit post or a shit post?>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<Or was it a shit post for a shit post..>>><<<Balance looks nice.>>><<<Reminds me of old school FPV goggles. Pilots before my time in FPV use to make their goggles out of old ski goggles and fly with those.>>><<<They actually made their own headsets? That’s pretty neat>>><<<I wouldn't call FPV goggles headsets per say, but yeah lol. They're mostly just 5.8ghz radio receivers with a screen. They pickup low latency video transmissions from the drone and pump them into your eyes as quick as possible.>>><<<🤣 oh yeah I think I remember seeing it with a high end dji drone it's similar to what you're describing>>><<<Interestingly enough, the DJI goggles can be used for home built drones just as well as old school analog ones. In fact because they transmit a digital signal, the picture quality and framerate are much better. I have a homemade race drone that is bound to those DJI goggles, I also have the DJI drone, which really isn't that impressive. It flies like it's drunk.>>><<<🤣 I just pictured a dji drone getting drunk then flying although that's pretty cool that works with non dji drones😁>>><<<Pretty much what its like. And it kinda does. You've gotta add DJI's little box and camera, but it integrates with betaflight flight controllers just fine.>>><<<What's beta flight?>>><<<Betaflight is the firmware installed on the computers that are in our race quads.>>><<<Probably better than everything facebook has done after the og rift...>>><<<Meet the Engineer>>><<<Have you named this device yet?

This is amazing, teach me how pls>>><<<Next step, get a 3D printer, cad up some designs, create an open source GitHub project and get yourself a community. Continue to develop this project with the community (or all by yourself), Launch a Patreon. maybe when you have a fully functional reliable prototye you're proud of, reach out to The Mysticle on YouTube and ask him to cover your project. Your community will grow in no time and I have no doubt that the VR community will support you on this project. We need more unique projects like this aiming at consumers.

Musicians and cooking come to mind. Lord knows it's a pain when my phone locks, I have food on my hands, but also need to see the next ingredient.

/me dawns his cooking goggles>>><<<Didn’t google already try that? Something called Glass. I believe there was a special name for people wearing them, as well.>>><<<They did try glass but it wasn't this per say. It was a single, non-stereo/3D, display. They tried to stuff a whole smartphone into it, basically. Added a bunch of features no one asked for and cameras that were pretty invasive. Charged an ungodly amount of money for it. And then half assed it until they killed it, as Google products go. Similar, but clearly not the same for several reasons.>>><<<&gt;Added a bunch of features no one asked for

That was kind of the point. They were trying to figure out how people would actually use it.

&gt;cameras that were pretty invasive

How so? The device was not meant for streaming/continuous recording. 30 minutes of continuous camera operation would kill the battery if it didn't overheat first. It's a lot easier to secretly record someone by pretending to mess around on your phone, than it is by staring directly at them with a weird thing on your face. You can get a hidden camera pen to stick in your shirt pocket for $30 on Amazon, and it will record much longer.

&gt;And then half assed it until they killed it, as Google products go.

You're talking out your ass. They've released two hardware revisions since they "killed" it; You can buy a new one right now with next day shipping.

For the displays to properly reflect into the eye the glasses would need to have a reflective lattice on them to redirect the light by 135 degrees, otherwise the displays will reflect at 90 degrees which would direct the into the top of the headset, not the eyes. Of course, reflective lattice is not easy to etch into a pair of plastic glasses and I can't see it in the photo so I will assume it's not there. If OP can enlighten me on how he directs the reflection from the displays into his pair of blinkers I'm all ears.>>><<<The thing is actually working( for now it’s just a spinning cube) but the screens aren’t perfect, but it doesn’t reflect to the top of the headset but I need to position it more accurately>>><<<Giving me edgerunner vibes when he shows up to class and busts their system>>><<<What can you even do with it?>>><<<Nice work!

And in a year when that orangutan is back….>>><<<I used pico 4 and now quest 3. For gaming you can just install virtual desktop and you are set no extra apps nor Internet access for both pico 4 and quest 3.

 But if you wanna stream the headset pov even before entering the game or os menus (useful when guiding people trying the headset) on pico 4 this is possible offline but not quest 3 since that one require Internet access for some reason : )

The main thing that I miss about the pico 4 is how easy it is to cast to any device in my local network directly without apps...>>><<<Thanks a lot for your response. Would you prefer the Quest3 over the Pico 4 generally?>>><<<Pico 4 is a great value but If money is no issue and you will get a battery strap for quest 3. Then yes I prefer quest 3, in many aspects there is improvement. &gt;&gt;&gt; except for the pet peeve of casting easily offline mentioned above.>>><<<The idea is to stick a screen on a stripped down phone VR headset. Put a Raspberry Pi with dual camera and 6DOF sensor on it and have the crappiest yet affordable way of doing experimenting with Mixed Reality.>>><<<I admire your effort.

I pre-ordered the original bank in 2013, and I wasn't sure they'd stick around>>><<<ok wow!>>><<<that link says a lot about your relation to privacy.>>><<<Yeah. Whatcha gonna do now that you know I have a huawei phone?>>><<<He can feel cool and write the comment>>><<<i can see, that you use one of the most privacy disrespectful browsers, one of the most privacy disrespectful search engines and all that on a phone, from a companie that got banned in the USA for allegedly spying on it's users. the fact, that you involuntarily shared all this information, just adds too perfectly to the image for me not to point it out.

this is what i meant. i hope you can see where i am comming from. 

seriously, if your privacy and the privacy of your fellow human beings means anything to you, please switch. there are countless browsers and search engines, that provide a lot of comfort, while protecting you data. under this capitalist system we unfortunately vote with our money. by using google you are actively supporting their privacy policies and helping to eliminate privacy.>>><<<Just because you have an Index doesn't mean that your are better then anyone else>>><<<protect your privacy. if everything else is to much effort for you, at least install a safe browser and use a good search engine. 

i think privacy is importan and we should defend and reclaim it. as a result of this, i chose an index. i know not everyone can afford to uphold their values like this. i can myself often not afford it and you could even argue, that buying a headset at all is already against my values. i do not think my headset choice makes me superior. i do think though that you should fucking value your privacy and not be an angry jack. if you don't think privacy is important, say so. otherwise protect yours instead of attacking me for telling you to do so.>>><<<You have a reasonable point but I really think you should work on your execution of trying to share it with others.

Your posts came off really adversarial and immediately get people offside. It's not the best way to bring something to light if you want people to take what you have to say seriously.>>><<<i guess you are right.

people feel attacked extreamly fast, when you tell them to do the moral thing. going slow enough to not offend them is hard and feels like a betrayal to my own values. i need to work on myself there>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<At what stage have I implied that it was in active developement?>>><<<If you're interested in screwing around with AR/MR on a budget you should consider a Meta 2 (no, it's not *that* Meta) developer kit.

You can usually find one for $300-500 on eBay, but if you're willing to wait for a deal to show up you can get them for less. I just picked one up for $140.

The tracking isn't perfect, but it's not bad. The hand tracking can be a little hit or miss, but gets better once you learn how to hold your hands the way it likes.

The company went out of business a few years ago, so you won't be getting any support or updates, but it's still very usable in its current state. Supports a proprietary API in Unity, as well as SteamVR. I haven't messed with the SteamVR support yet, but it took me about half an hour to make a basic app in Unity with minimal Unity experience. 

Also has a ~90° FoV. Really can't go wrong if you're just looking for a cheap AR device to play with.>>><<<There's a VR/AR headset that was already named "Meta" BEFORE the FB/Oculus name change?? 😂>>><<<Yep. Originally released in 2016.>>><<<Bet they're regretting the going out of business lol>>><<<Fun fact, there is a Meta 2 development headset in a cardboard box four feet from my desk right now. 

Please, god, someone get this out of my apartment. 300-500 sounds totally fair and cheaper is fine if you'll actually come here and get it (bay area). 

FWIW, I was able to see spykids 3D but using the meta makes me want to hurl. That said, I never tinkered much with their final firmware update that was supposed to improve stability considerably.>>><<<Alright. Once you get this proof of concept done, get at me and we can design a 6DoF headset with a Qualcomm Snapdragon running 2x 1440p passthrough cameras and 4x 480p tracking cameras. Lets make mixed reality *compelling*.

Seriously, I want my virtual workstation, where i put on my headset, see my field of virtual displays in my room/office, and still see my keyboard, mouse, coffee, and spliff. 

Srsly, Mixed reality is exciting, it still needs good hardware.>>><<<basically lynx>>><<<But with hybrid aspheric/fresnel lenses and a min 5k micro LED display with retina tracking for realtime IPD adjustment and foveated rendering. And a headset with a removable shroud. And WiGig instead of cables... lets make this shit happen.>>><<<What kind of screen is on it? Is it like a phone screen with the vr kinda effect or is it 2 round screens or something like that?>>><<<https://www.uctronics.com/uctronics-7-inch-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi-1024-600-capacitive-hdmi-lcd-touchscreen-monitor-portable-display-for-pi-4-b-3-b-windows-10-8-7-free-driver.htm

It is like a tiny tablet screen. The dual camera's will indeed split the screen for each eye.>>><<<1024 by 600? That's rough for VR. Admirable project, though.>>><<<The monitor supports full HD 1920 * 1080. I realise the quality is rough but I couldnt justify spending a large amount of money on a specialized screen.

Money is a bit of a defining factor, because if I up the camera's or screen more than other components then I almost automatically would have to invest in computing power and the other components to a higher level, which quickly complicates the project and spirals out of control cost wise. :)

If my proof of concept works and I am confident enough in it, maybe one day can start upgrading to a closer to modern standards build :D>>><<<&gt;The monitor supports full HD 1920 * 1080.

It supports a 1080p signal, but it's still going to display it at 1024 x 600.>>><<<Ah thats rough, but I am glad I didnt go with the 480 x 600 that supports 1920 x 1080 then XD

Either way its not gonna be amazingly modern.>>><<<If you do a second revision order a replacement screen for a Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. It's a 5.5" native 4k screen for $50. You'll need board to convert the HDMI signal to something the display can handle, but those aren't too expensive.

They're popular for homebuilt projectors, so there's plenty of info out there on how to get them setup to display an HDMI signal.>>><<<Thank you! Thats something I wouldn't have stumbled upon myself! For that price it might be worthwhile to check it out even before the prototype is finished.

Would you happen to have some resources for that? A link or file of some sorts?>>><<<I believe DIY Perks on YouTube was the one who popularized making it into a projector.

https://youtu.be/YfvTjQ9MCwY

It doesn't look to me like it's actually $50, though. His link for the 4k display + control board leads to a bunch of ~$250 listings. Maybe there's another source of them that's still cheaper, like AliExpress? I'm not sure.>>><<<[Here's](https://www.ebay.com/itm/402331164941) everything you need in one box. If you want to save some money and buy the parts separately you just need a phone display, and an HDMI to MIPI board. Make sure to check the board's specs and confirm it supports your panels resolution and uses the same connector. Really not much to it beyond that. Hook the board up to the LCD, power on the board, and plug in an HDMI source. Should work just like a regular monitor.

Panelook.com is the best place I know of for detailed specs on bare LCD panels. Look up the part number for whatever panel you're interested in on there, and note what it says under Signal Interface. Then find a converter board with the same interface.

Edit: just remembered most of the 4k driver boards can only do 30hz which would be terrible for an HMD. So you'd probably want to go with a 1080p or 1440p panel. Don't have any specific recommendations for those, but there are plenty of options out there.>>><<<Any plans for the software?>>><<<looks like next VR kickstart project can get going , try to beat up Pimax and Oculus record>>><<<Wouldnt be the most affordable way be to just use your phone?>>><<<Absolutely, but way less fun designing and solving the many problems that this idea poses :)>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<With DIY, while I first usually start it to save money I often end up with something that was as expensive as the commercial product and is not even working good :D

However what I learned from all my DIY "projects" over time is absolutely priceless and cannot be bought so easy.>>><<<Oh yeah, my cheapest option comment was semi-sarcastic. There are absolutely cheaper/more cost effective ways. But it feels cheaper ;)>>><<<[deleted]>>><<<I suspect they also have fun doing it. Kind of the idea for DIY projects.>>><<<For serious development oculus gives developers WAY too many hurdles. You can build apps for quest, in the way that oculus wants you to. Actual control over the device is not an option with oculus.  
That's the facebook walled garden. Worst thing that ever happened to VR (and there's people that actually think facebook is good for vr, total idiots)>>><<<OP isn’t going to develop a standalone headset as far as I can tell.  Maybe I am wrong.  In that case the Quest 2 is a cheap and easy way to develop for PCVR

Oculus just opened up pass-through to devs so shitty mixed reality is now open.

Side loading on to your own device does not require a paid dev license, unlike Apple.   Pretty much anyone can do it and get reasonably decent access to the hardware,  

 The underlying architecture is just Android so lots of tools available including Unity.

I’m not a Facebook fan by any means but after years of Apple development I might have some insight.>>><<<I would guess Facebook is practically required to do this to attract developers for what is a much much smaller market than Apple.>>><<<Might be.  Still>>><<<Wondering what the unlocked bootloader of the oculus go will bring us>>><<<note that in my experience to fully utilize the pi4 gpu you need to go 64bit. just fyi to save you a headache in discovery as default raspbian is 32bit.>>><<<What are you gonna use as controllers?>>><<<It's cool and all, but how is this any different from say google cardboard that you can get for like $20?>>><<<This is a full HMD, not a piece of cardboard to stick a phone into.>>><<<Yeah, but it's a phone screen, powered by an RPI. Your not running desktop VR applications with a PI for many reasons, at least not in a way that you can't get a phone to do anyway (eg streaming), I just can't really see what additional practical capabilities this would have that using a phone woulden't.>>><<<As he says, experimenting with mixed reality by using multiple cameras and passing the augmented video to the screen. Sure, you could maybe do that with a phone if you had a compatible phone and knew how to program for Android, but Android probably doesn't quite have the freedom to experiment as freely.>>><<<Ahh this reminds me of 2014/2015 era. Very nice.>>><<<Reminds me of Oculus DK1>>><<<Here we go again! I hope this one doesn't sell out!>>><<<The Rift [DK1](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RiftDK1) and [DK2](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RiftDK2) are both open source. You may want to start by replicating one, and you will quickly find that putting a screen in front of some lenses is by far the easiest part of creating a viable VR HMD.>>><<<It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users.

some tips:

* weight adds up. strip everything unnecessary
* cables too. you probably don't have one of those crazy oculink cables so HDMI + Audio + USB will add weight+pull to the HMD. try to use a breakout box or something on your waist
* leap motion might be an interesting solution for controllers, it wasn't that good when I used it mounted to the HMD but I heard it got a lot better
* good luck with the 6DOF I have no idea how to do that!

but: 

&gt; crappiest yet most affordable

I am sorry that the reactions on your post were so weirdly negative.

Did you go on to develop it further?>>><<<oh it’s completely fine!! and no, pi 0’s aren’t very quick>>><<<In all honesty, the most affordable way to do VR is the Quest 2; you won't be able to build anything yourself for cheaper than it. If you really want cheap, you can do Google Cardboard or one of those not-cardboard-but-still-$100 things, the ones that were released around the time the original Oculus Rift (CV1) was released. 

Even if all the components are cheaper than a Quest 2, you'll spend at least 2x that because you'll find that some parts aren't compatible, and will need to spend extra on the plastic housings and stuff just to hold them all together. That's not to mention the HUGE amount of time this project would require; months at minimum.

Have you thought of how you'll actually get content onto the device and use it? There will be a ton of programming required to make anything render in passthrough; and if you try to program it all yourself, then it'll only work with art assets that you personally made - you can't import some FBX model and expect it to "just work". You'll need to figure out what libraries are compatible, then how to set up those libraries with your passthrough video, how to do virtual lighting in those libraries (because if you don't, the object is either pitch black, or it will look like a flat silhouette (and not 3D at all) because it's the shading and shadows that indicate shape; just try making something in Unity without giving it any texture or material). In other words, this is months of work ***if you've done all this before***, and a multi-year project if you haven't. And what would you get from it at the end? A VR/AR headset which has almost no content, only you know how to use, and which has no commercialization potential. 

I'm sorry to give you "bad" news like that, but there is a truth that you must follow if you want to use your time usefully: **use the tools that already exist; dont re-invent the wheel**. Existing headsets are those tools. 

Please, save yourself the months of frustration and wasted time. Because yes, that time will be wasted. Even if other people try to jump in with "he'll learn a ton, that time isn't wasted!" - you'll learn things that will never be useful elsewhere; it will be 1% as useful as learning a broader skillset which is in demand. There are no VR hardware jobs for people without at least a college degree in the applicable fields; so even if that job is your specific goal, you are better off studying it in college (then maybe some headset could be a capstone/thesis project, and would at least have use for the degree).

There is a reason there are 100x as many companies creating apps, games, and programs that run on headsets than there are companies creating headsets. 

I say this as someone who has made hardware devices from scratch, and learned this stuff the hard way.>>><<<This man is learning stuff, it's about the journey not the destination 😉>>><<<Fax! The route is the goal!>>><<<The cake is a lie, just saying>>><<<I am a webdesigner by day and really have been wanting to build anything but didnt have any drive or good inspiration. When I found r/cyberDeck a while back, I knew what I wanted to do. 

All the points you make are valid. However I am not driven by any deadlines or needing to create a product that can be sold. This project is completely for fun.

Thanks for being real with me, but I considered everything you said before I dove into the project and still decided the fun would be worth my time. :D>>><<<Good to hear! I always worry that these things are started by someone young and without significant resources; but in your case you're fine. I'm sure you'll have the expected balance of fun and frustration in the project :) 

Go for it!>>><<<Keep on going :)>>><<<&gt; Even if all the components are cheaper than a Quest 2, you'll spend at least 2x that because you'll find that some parts aren't compatible, and will need to spend extra on the plastic housings and stuff just to hold them all together.

What if one is looking for a Linux-compatible PCVR headset where the Quest 2 is not an option? Then the best comparison should be a used Vive, not an Oculus Quest 2. And in this case, depending on which parts one sources, one may be able to get better displays than the original Vive has. Making something oneself, also allows one to verify that it is quality and repairable, a rare trait in today's hardware. There aren't many headsets out there that meet my standards for reparability and openness, so I would certainly consider creating my own eventually if no new options come up that are good.

Why would everything need to be from scratch? Program a driver for SteamVR or Monado, that way off-the-shelf software will work. These are open platforms designed to be extensible by third parties. This could also be made much easier by using SteamVR tracking, which I believe can also be used with existing free/open source drivers.>>><<<&gt; This could also be made much easier by using SteamVR tracking

Vive Tracker $100-$150 per piece.

The problem with lighthouse tracking is that you get entire used CV1 or WMR sets on ebay for the price of the tracking system alone.>>><<<Again, that has Linux compatibility problems. Even when using reverse engineered solutions – https://monado.freedesktop.org/ – CV1 is not supported and WMR does not have controller support. And, this still does not solve the problem of wanting a headset that is very easy to repair, because it was built DIY in the first place, nor gives the advantage, of current off-the-shelf display panels being potentially higher resolution – [Relativty](https://www.relativty.com/)'s [current display panels](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32975198897.html) are 1440x1440 at 120 fps and therefore beat my used Vive in these areas. 

&gt; Basestation $100-$150 per piece.

Ironically, the best deal on this may be by buying an entire used Vive. Mine was $250 including base stations, controllers, and the HMD itself. So in all honesty, the most practical solution of cheap Linux PCVR is almost certainly a used Vive. 

Which is good, yes. In fact it is quite reliable and most parts are easy to repair; it is the best off-the-shelf headset for this that I have found. But I would like something where it is easy for me to swap out the display panels and lenses, so I can get a better display. For this, I would want to keep my existing tracking, while upgrading the HMD, and then when I upgrade the HMD, only upgrade part of it rather than the entire thing. The competition here are the Vive Pro and Valve Index, which are significantly more expensive and come with built-in headphones which I prefer to avoid in favour of using my own.

&gt;
&gt; Tundra Tracker $100 per piece.

I would want to use integrated tracking with a module [like this](https://tundra-labs.com/products/steamvr-tracking-general-purpose-hdk-reference-design-tl448k6d-gp-hdk), not something tacked on top of the HMD. That option which is actually a _more_ expensive than the trackers currently (I wonder why. More tracking points?), but can get a constellation of tracking points over a larger area that is integrated into the HMD. Might also use something based on Attila's DIY base station trackers (WIP), if it ends up cheaper or more reliable for the same spread of points. Annoyingly I cannot find a homepage URL for it right now – [this is the site where pre-compiled kits will eventually be sold at](https://vrkitz.com/), [and this is the Discord, which has much more information](https://discord.gg/X8TQa4D6wP). I am planning to build this first, as I would really like full-body tracking but have not found a single option where it is easy to replace the battery. Going DIY would ensure that, since I can make it, I can also tear it apart and repair it when the battery inevitably stops holding charge. Because that's always the issue for me: Either the cable or battery.>>><<<I wasn't trying to advocate buying these headsets, I was just complaining about the price of lighthouse tracking. :)

&gt; https://monado.freedesktop.org/ – CV1 is not supported

Thaytan's OpenHMD fork with his tracking implementation is supported, including controller inputs.

&gt; and WMR does not have controller support.

True. It's being hacked on but progress isn't the fastest.

Out of stock, the shortage strikes again. https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Generic/HTC-Vive-Headset-Sensor-Array/IF453-004 has this ever been available?

You should have read the last line of my post.

And I didn't include my fuller history: I created a company that makes robots that remove landmines; I built much of our early hardware myself, and programmed it myself, before I began hiring employees after more than a year of getting the project going (as both a technical project and as a company).

You're talking to one of the people who has literally started a technical project and turned it into a successful company.>>><<<Thats great, I never questioned your expertise. I just implied that any kind of success is not the main goal of the project but having fun in doing it, achieving something that shows it can work and learning a lot when doing it. Building something on your own also gives you a much deeper understanding of how it works, I think with your background you know that :)

Really cool that you do such an important work. Thumbs up for that.>>><<<the next palmer luckey>>><<<So he's going to duct tape a bunch of hardware he can't get working properly together and hope a legendary programmer that lives nearby shows up to do all the hard parts?

Just hard and difficult. But I am willing to spend time and effort to get there.>>><<<Haha, yeah that's more accurate, I always thought once  VR becomes mainstream, headsets will become like PC'S and people will build their own with parts from different companies...
