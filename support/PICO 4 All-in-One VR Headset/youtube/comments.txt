<<<you need to be online with it that is one way of them accessing information like face scans to be sent back to china for evaluation i have lack of trust when electronics ask to be on line amp ask for more personal details before you can use it >>><<<they are locking up these devices to their stores games controllers vr should be open platform so you can buy controllers including specialty gun like for any device you should also be able to play steam vr games regardless of your vr headset if they do not standardize these things vr is not going to be popular at leas nowhere near as popular as regular consoles >>><<<the middle fingers that is the real test>>><<<did not apple copy these guys >>><<<who also checked his steam inbox 7 19 >>><<<hi this head set have some sort of lag in games in wireless mode i buyed reverb g2 and sell it a few months ago because the lenses become blurry after minutes of use >>><<<highly reluctant to give facebook my hard earned cash made my mind up pico 4 it is great review mate >>><<<what about the quest 3 the quest 3 has full colour past through and no fish eye small controllers so you do not clash them together and the headset is so much smaller so it is so much more portable to take around >>><<<so let me do the math here regarding the controllers after a quick google search you can see that a double a battery has a capacity of 1800 to 2700mah at 1 5v let is be realistic and land on a 2400mah battery for a very decent one an economical 18650 lithium ion battery that has a great capacity is the samsung 35e or something 3500mah at 3 6v so 1 5 2400 3 6wh 3 6 3500 12 6wh so say you are a dedicated gamer you play vr games for more than 10 hours per week every week you will have to pay about 4dollar for batteries at the end of the first year will have paid more than 200dollar maybe even 250dollar for batteries d how much is a samsung 35e 3dollar  6dollar for two controllers so why do not they put 18650s in there weight no 2 aa batteries is 46grams 1 18650 is 48grams xd charging controller and type c port literally 1dollar or less manufacturing cost  so why environmental concerns surely after 200 batteries thrown in your trash per year this is not realistic  so  i rest my case they are just stupid they do not get that 4 aa batteries for the two controllers is a considerable expense if they are used frequently >>><<<good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life >>><<<reasons why to not get the pico 4 you can not play gorilla tag on it theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100dollar while pico costs 430dollar and its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can not do anything about it>>><<<hi i am planning to buy this one i would like to ask how harmful it is for the eyes and neck >>><<<thank you my friend for the detailed explanation but you forgot to talk about screen resolution when watching movies >>><<<bruh this is like meta stealing picos style>>><<<does the pico 4 pro have eye and face tracking im unsure on this>>><<<so the quest 3 but objectivally worse>>><<<is it compatible with ps5 >>><<<quest 2 quest 3 quest pro pico 4>>><<<i am looking at getting one but need to know what it is like if you wear glasses also is it good for watching films and tv >>><<<just got one as my first headset really good but the standalone games are actually terrible so i use it with steam if i knew i would only use it with steam i probably would have saved up for a bit longer probably would have gone mad waiting for a headset and gotten a valve index even though it is heavy or a bigscreen when it comes out maybe even a quest 3 since it is lighter but not as balanced >>><<<whts the pico library now for games and apps>>><<<does pico vr pc connect require a good pc or it runs on pico>>><<<i purchased a local chinese copy and want to use it in africa is it possible that i will encounter problems while downloading games and updating the system >>><<<do not get why people giving such hate on the built in audio it was 10x better then what all the reviews are saying about it standalone games library is still poor tho 12 months after release and no mod support for games like contractors kinda sucks plus still no pavlov shack >>><<<thanks for saying what the company making this also makes >>><<<it actually has gorilla tag >>><<< >>><<<love pico but wavy lenses >>><<< 14 21 >>><<<publisher is bytedance hence i do not recommend this headset research the actions they have committed

games on it>>><<<i just want anything thats not oculus they give me so many issues and can not fix a single one my headset has become a brick>>><<< nope none of that china garbage facebook bad china worse bytedance can suck it >>><<<nahhh tic tac>>><<<what is a good vr headset budget friendly to connect to laptops for adult content thanks >>><<<sell your data to the zucc or to china pick your poison i just want a standalone vr headset that i can start using without any accounts and that doesnt have yet another proprietary software store that requires developers to support it creating yet another ecosystem but works seamlessly with all vr games out of the box regardless of where they were purchased  something like an android for vr>>><<<no thanks i am not putting my hard earned dollars into chinese owned competition >>><<<my pico 4 is coming tomorrow i will try it with wire and then try to swap to wifi then perhaps i shall buy a dedicated router anyhow i am happy to join vr playerbase>>><<<n o genuinly that ipd motor is far better than doing manually it is usefull >>><<<there is a split audio and charger adapter>>><<<not compatible with quest games period >>><<<so if i install virtual desktop i could play all the quest games on the pico 4 headset >>><<<i just ordered these for myself i am interested using the built in games and steam vr thank you for the review video >>><<<great review do i need a specialized link cable or any usb c to usb cable will do it seems quest uses the same type of cable also would a quest cable work then thanks >>><<<really pico 4 is just trash bro>>><<<how is this not the same os as oculus am i tripping>>><<<how much does virtual desktop cos aud >>><<<im pretty sure that you had a yellow dot because when you expose your lenses to the suns it basicly kills the pixels>>><<<how did you record a dead pixel >>><<<is this headset able to work as a monitor as in could you plug it into your computer and watch or play something like cyberpunk >>><<<zkxdokd>>><<<owned by the chinese communist party that is all i needed to know thanks >>><<<not gonna lie this headset in my opinion is head on against the quest 2 and if improved will 100percent be better >>><<<i have owned both headsets before and i prefer the pico 4 a lot more than the quest 2 at this point it is just the better choice >>><<<it would be nice to see developer port the quest 2 firmware to pico 4>>><<<a great alternative of spending all of your money on one thing>>><<<ps vr 2>>><<<thank you man very positive and informative thank you dear >>><<<were you paid to leave this review >>><<<pico from fnf>>><<<so how about a more recent video 6 months in which is the better one>>><<<terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2>>><<<forget handbreak steam vr what is about performance pusher open xr >>><<<quest2 2 0 >>><<<does anyone notice this looks like the ready player one vr headset>>><<<is it better the then the quest or is it the best vr>>><<<would really love to see an update video on this headset to see if they fixed most of your problems with it >>><<<my nick name is pico  i am so surprised to see this  i am real >>><<<it is funny to think how much money meta lost raising the price of the quest 2>>><<<i need to crack down on my unnecessary spending so i can save up for a vr hedset right now the pico 4 is at the top of my list but by christmas i might spot something different that is still under dollar1 000 >>><<<question can one buy this but not let tiktok collect your information seeing its owned by bydance ccp spy company can it be used off there grid with there spy collections softer ware >>><<<and that is what i call a beautiful design>>><<<thanks for the review ten hag ggmu >>><<<advanced beat saber players beware considering the pico4 for playing everything expert on beat saber tldr forget it  long version  if you use the pico streaming assistant either over wifi or over usbc and you crank up the video settings to the max the image quality is still inferior to a valve index because it is blurry lower the settings and it becomes more blurry no matter how it is blurry despite the pancake lenses personally i prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect as on the index than a blurry image without some say the pico streamer app is compressing the video too much who knows whatever the limitation is it sucks  so if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you will need to use virtual desktop virtual desktop consists of 2 parts an app on the pico and a streamer app on your pc but there is a but virtual desktop is streamer app wants to go over wifi only there used to be workarounds involving tethering over usb but after the last firmware update they do not work anymore the workaround involved installing an android app apk which allowed you to access all of the pico is hidden settings besides it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up tons of forums to read on reddit hard to get right on the first try and you had to enable the settings on the pico and on your pc every time before playing uggh if with your previous headset you used to just start vr and play this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker  but now for the major deal breaker the controllers omg these controllers are so bad for playing beat saber it is worse if you have big hands their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and secure grip you end up clicking buttons all the time while playing and you know what that does the plastic is super slippery when playing fast they will slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed do not even think of playing any camellia map when you see youtubers play beat saber with them they all play very slowly clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming the tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play it works but it will ruin your pp  for the rest i found the face mask to be very uncomfortable compared to a valve index but i guess ymmv and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and do not let light in from the sides  i returned my pico4 after less than a week of daily use the poor image quality due to the streaming limitations and the slippery un ergonomic inaccurate controllers made me do so >>><<<what games can you not play on the pico that you can on the quest>>><<<its like meta quest pro>>><<<pico 4 is gt gt gt gt gt gt gt psvr just for that middle finger>>><<<so its a quest 2 but worse >>><<< 14 27 interesting subliminal message >>><<<should i get quest 2 or pico 4>>><<<is the pico 4 able to run adobe medium >>><<<one of the reasons sony apparently went with fresnel on psvr2 was the amount of light it could passthrough vs pancake lenses wanting hdr is why they went with fresnel they claimed >>><<<headset like momentum 4 can do around 60 hours of playing music now i know a vr headset would be more power hungry but i bet the battery can be improved to at least 10 15 hours 2 3 is too little in my opinion>>><<<your dog is so cute >>><<<i play sim racing games and microsoft flight simulator would the pico 4 be suitable >>><<<i have quest 2 and watching this shit>>><<<the pico 4 is a total game changer >>><<<i bet you do not have to have a fb account to get it to work >>><<<what is the point of making the ui almost identical to

just want to say it is great to have a channel like this you do such a great job on reviews and i just want to ask you a question as far as today is right now which do you think is the best headset right now in 2023 >>><<< 13 20 thats so retarded lol why no headphone jack >>><<<geekvr has a nice face cover makes the pico 4 look even smaller>>><<<by competition you mean it smashes it right the quest 3 will basically be this >>><<<hey i have a littel problem with my pico 4 the pov of my pico dous not look like the one he shows insted mine is pixelated>>><<<maybe it is quest killer but first it is quest copy>>><<<why are they not selling this in the us did pico ever give a statement on that >>><<<my pc is connected to the internet via lan is it possible to use virtual desktop with a router while being connected to the internet via lan >>><<<creator of tiktok ok i will pass >>><<<can you use pico 4 with gt7 >>><<<its a good entry point but as soon as someone says i need to have an account for a physical device its a no go for me >>><<<why are people not putting headphone jacks on their devices first the reverb g1 and g2 and now the pico 4 >>><<<i can not wait to be able to use one of these vrs to watch porn videos maybe with a sucker included to act as a vagina or oral cavity who knows how many boys will also try the gay version while we are at it >>><<<in my opinion the biggest flaws the pico 4 has are that the handtracking doesnt really work for me at least and the game library isnt great so far there are even some games that entirely just do not work like ruinsmagus also it just feels like sometimes the games get really pixelated and low res but on the other hand i got nothing to compare as this is my first vr headset>>><<<is hitman vr in epic games launcher compatible with the pico 4 >>><<<frackin ell mike you have come a long way in a short time your vids are unreal great review mate keep up the good work thank you>>><<<how does the recline

alternative for quest 2 and better visual experience more than rest thanks for review buddy >>><<<i wouldnt buy this its another tech giant from communist china to gain all your personal info>>><<< 10 52 can you do this test between the pro and pico 4 i just want an upgrade for immersed and i would go with the pico 4 >>><<<since it does not have the audio jack i do have the baseus usb type c to audio jack and type c port adapter it will not work on my samsung phone so it was such a waste but will it work for pico 4 >>><<<im geting a power link kabel compo from amazon>>><<< 2 25 already they did something better than quest>>><<<everyone here because they got one for christmas >>><<<maybe no if they are the same company that owns tik tok then they are going to have creative ways to steal your info and record you i am aware that facebook does that stuff too but there are easy ways to solve those problems on the quest >>><<<did we ever hear back from pico about that dead pixel i am interested to see how their customer service dealt with your issue>>><<<i have a quest 2 and the only thing that would keep me from buying the pico 4 is the lack of a headphone jack>>><<<thanks for the review is the screen door effect still there >>><<<one is manufacturing and other is during sale>>><<<10 15 or 15 10 or 15 15>>><<<bought a pico 4 today it seems ok but kind of baffled that it did not feel that different from the old first version of oculus except that the text in the sweetspot was way sharper could also be that in the headsett it just don t actually use the higher res but the other thing is that it felt like i was looking through a binocular is the screens to far away or is it just the way it is don t remember it being like that in oculus menaing that i notice the corners i do know that pico is round to the sides and not the others that i am aware of though i do like that the sweet spot is overall bigger making it a bit easier with headaches and such >>><<<i can not even consider an alternative unless there is the ability to work virtually like i can on the quest with horizon workroom and immersedvr >>><<<might finally upgrade from my oculus rift hope my router can keep up with the streaming bandwidth though >>><<<def happy that it has better fov than quest 2 while also being easier to read text i always feel like things being blurry from afar and the tunnel vision being the two most discomforting things in vr still wish in the future that they will somehow be able to pack even more fov into these things without sacrificing on sizwe though human eyes do have around 180 fov when looking around so it is a shame that currently we can only get just above half of that >>><<<but does not virtual desktop destroy some of the 3d sensation i e is not it more like playing on a flat screen >>><<<i need helo should i buy the quest 2 or pico for i do not know now bc at first i wanted to buy the quest 2 now idk>>><<<good review thanks i was looking for an alternative to meta quest as i do not want to have a meta facebook account which i will be forced to have from january 2023 when meta will effectively brick my quest does the pico have a browser >>><<<the build quality looks so much better than quest 2>>><<<can you play gorilla tag    >>><<<finally replacing my oculus quest 1>>><<<no one talks about how horrible the lenses are on pico 4 is the ghosting on these things is horrible and also the screen door effect is awful the battery life is horrendous totally not an upgrade more like a sidegrade do not buy if you have a quest 2 you will not be satisfied with the upgrade >>><<<the software looks exactly like quest>>><<<i am going to wait until summer before deciding on what next headset to buy i am eager to get away from oculus but i would like to keep my existing pcvr game library on there i was planning on the quest3 because i imagine it will be much more affordable than the pro but if the pico 4 is a solid competitor then i might just settle for it we will see what meta has to offer if they have anything to offer by summertime otherwise it is likely going to be the pico4 and for my existing oculus library i will just be running revive i guess >>><<<any wireless vr can beat the quest 2 especially the pico 4>>><<<when tiktok does better than meta themselves >>><<<pico 4 has extra tracking devices to track all body parts >>><<<can you play any game >>><<< 00 18 what is the thing on the glass and where can i get it >>><<<hi thanks for the review i do not have a pc but a chromebook is there a way to get the pico up to date how about netflix is there an app for netflix is it the same or better than oculus i have to be honest i am not a gamer i only use vr headsets to watch movies on big screen are youtube and prime also available >>><<<the headset may be great on paper or if you get a unit that is not faulty i received a unit with heavy lens distortion there is more and more threads on discord and reddit showing up on this issue it seems that pico released batches to market with faulty lenses in my case this caused severe nausea had to return >>><<<i just do not think it is worth it it is basically a copy of the oculus especially the software compare it side by side oculus may even be able to sue it is insane >>><<<i play a lot of il 2 sturmovik vr and i want to buy a new vr headset as my current set rift s is too low res to spot or id planes from any distance would you recommend the pico for this or is there another headset that would be better that isnt too expensive >>><<<what a lovely little dog what a star videos are always better with a dog >>><<<my quest is really messed up so this will be a good buy for me>>><<< 4 32 rest assured that in the headset it runs at a ismooth 72fps tfw motion sickness>>><<< 13 44 i can not even tell a difference if i did not buy the index a few days ago i would have gotten this>>><<<biggest issue for me is the game library and software and also there are not accessories to fix that headset that does not have the top part which would be uncomfortable it is a hard pass for me >>><<<so with using the pico 4 with the virtual desktop i have got a gtx 1070 8gb which isnt exactly bad but i am wondering whether it then fully depends on your pc hardware or only vr or both because i do not want to lack in the graphical department because of the 1070 any help would be appreciated >>><<<newbie here d may i know if this works with fallout 4 vr in stereo mode or does it work in stereo with normal fallout 4 asking cos of the controllers vs mouse keyboard thanks >>><<<have you tried turning the brightness down i know is counter intuitive but apparently it controls the white balance more than actual brightness that would be more a gamma the colours should improve also like this >>><<<seems like this is not available in the states >>><<<the fact the tik tok guys made this is such a heart breaking deal breaker fuck genuinely had interest in it>>><<<dude now we have another portable vr console where games need to be specifically ported to this nonsense is getting out of hand the market is totally split i am ignoring all this and waiting for standalone headsets like valve is deckard that will hopefully be open platform and out of the box compatible with pc vr games closed systems can buzz off with these the vr market is not going to get anywhere >>><<<half life on epic games store do not you mean full life nope myopia >>><<<does it run vrchat >>><<<thank you for letting me know the chinese company bytedance made the pico

review i currently use a quest 2 but only for flight sims via pcvr the problem is my ipd is somewhere around 75mm and the quest 2 is only just useable for me there is always some blurring in one or both eyes which gets very tiring over a long period i tried an hp reverb but that was even worse wonder if there is anywhere i can try a pico 4 before parting with my money >>><<<2160x2160 is not

out the us which is a big market for vr i have had people tell me that they will import it but pico said if you try to access their pico home and store on the headset it will not work so unfortunately i can not see it as an alternative to any quest products >>><<<i will wait for the quest 3 announced to be released next year >>><<<when are you getting the quest pro >>><<<am i on something or does

party is headset a headset designed to steal all your data>>><<<hi can you run oculus exclusive titles via pcvr when i try and run loan echo in the pico 4 i get an error steam title run great on virtual desktop >>><<<try getting a double adapter that has headphone jack and a usb port>>><<<looks great i like how the headset is smaller has full color passthrough for the same price as quest 2 but the software looks like they copied the ui of quest 2 to the dot >>><<<i wish they could send those to the us for us to try it >>><<<look this vr the pico 4 someone has to fina a way to put custom games like lightsaber and other meta owned games cuz i caant do a vr play session without those games honestly or meta has to make a contract with pico i guess someone please find the way>>><<<i do not know what oasis does to do it but he makes me feel excited and way more immersed when he does reviews almost as if i was there>>><<<pico 4 is cool but quest pro is better>>><<<i have the quest 2 and am not going to get another headset because tbh the games are pretty trash right now and the quest 2 is super uncomfortable but i can see why this new one might be better but just seems like a waste of money to buy this one too specially when there arnt a lot of changes and even the quest 2 pro is a complete waste of money and does not really change at all the only one calling my name is the psvr 2 that is gonna be a change>>><<<after being round the block selling my soul this remains my go to channel for vr news >>><<<ctrl c ctrl v>>><<<this headset is very cool however you can just tell that they took so much from the quest >>><<<does it support big screen i mean what about movie watching >>><<<not even considering any standalone headsets if they do not support alvr maybe they will port it over soon >>><<<i own an oculus rift while quest 2 seemed interesting trying the headset i found it to be way heavy and i am not sure i am all sold on it pico seems like a a good option mostly because i only play pc vr but i am unsure if i should invest in it is it worth upgrading from oculus rift to a pico also i wish more vr makers could make controllers like valve index >>><<<should you upgrade from quest 2 to pico 4 >>><<<so it does have capacitive sensors inside the controllers never seen that mentioned in other reviews >>><<<will it ever come to the states >>><<<i have a question will this vr headset be good for bone works or any games like that like example half life alex>>><<<it is october 22 and i am pretty sure like it is already sold out>>><<<shame they gave up on the displayport that wouldve really set it apart from the quest 2 but i guess the extra production cost versus the amount of people you have access to a powerful enough pc was just not worth it in their eyes i guess current gpus are now powerful enough where the compression isnt that noticeable unlike back in 2016 when it was necessary considering the 1060 being what was available at the time>>><<<i feel like i wasted my money on the oculus quest 2 >>><<<i wan t to get a vr headset should i get a quest 2 or the pico 4 >>><<<if you could please not jam the headphone plug into that usb port that would be wonderful thanks >>><<<am buying both for the hell of it>>><<<owned by tiktok i am immediately out facebook is trash tiktok is an actual dumpster fire >>><<<best saber suck>>><<<i got really excited thinking the controllers had finger tracking like the index sadge >>><<<pico 4 for pcvr quest 2 for standalone amp pcvr as someone with neither i do not know how important standalone will be to me so it is really not clear what i should get lol plus i miss out on being able to play re4vr and other quest exclusives >>><<<good deal if you want china harvesting all ur data>>><<<fuck the ccp and anything that they use to steal our data >>><<<just received my pico 4 and it is night and day difference for me from quest 2 however i can totally understand why some people may not feel as big a difference for me the sweet spot area in quest 2 is lenses is so small that it is almost unusable i actually ended up digging out my rift s again pico 4 is sweet spot is vastly bigger it is still not the entire field of view but not nearly as disruptive as in quest 2 therefore if you have also suffered from the tiny center clear area of quest 2 you will find pico 4 being miles better but if you have not had any problem with quest 2 in the first place you might not be as blown away >>><<<i still do not understand why they thought it was a good idea to region lock them like at least give the option to unlock it when buying one from china>>><<<giving my info to ccp vs lizardman i would choose ccp >>><<<i do not want to own either headset from facebook or china both are just spyware peices of junk of course saying all that people will just consider a conspiracy theorists or something >>><<<i need your opion on this i currently have a quest 1 for pcvr and i am going to get a new headset should i just stick with a quest 2 because i already have some standalone games on it or should i look at getting a pico 4 i need to know by the end of the month so anyone give me some advice please >>><<<i really like the look of the pico 4 but i just do not want to buy all of my games software again if only there was some kind of cross platform option >>><<<awesome detailed review as always i was waiting to see details of the pico 4 pro trying to decide if and when to upgrade from quest 2 with it only for enterprise outside china the pico 4 is an appealing option may wait and see what happens with the software updates and pico store great to see more options coming including psvr2 competition is great but it does make it hard to know where to spend my dollardollar also caution with committing too much to one platform excited to see what comes from sidequests backing from google this has the potential to make switching platforms easier and not losing your library could google play become the vr game store of choice >>><<<im actually thinking of switching my quest 2 for my pcvr use>>><<<quest 2 forever boiz >>><<<nice review i ordered my pico 4 set today and it is expected delivered on wednesday i live in norway and seems no delivery problems here at least not what i heard >>><<<this headset is literal garbage right now though because of its game library there is literally no reason to buy something that doesnt have any good games to play>>><<<would never support tik tok binance they are part of this county going to shambles so therefore i would rather have the quest 2>>><<<when i save up i am buying to upgrade from my quest 1>>><<<i just want that shiny box it comes in >>><<<if these come to the us i would consider one to replace my rift s >>><<<thank you>>><<<tea tea coffee 4 life >>><<<kind of crazy how similar it is to the quest 2 even the system menus looks like the quest i guess that is a good thing though if you are the kind of person that wants a quest 2 just without the facebook nonsense >>><<<pico 4 pinnochio 4 >>><<<pico obviously copied the quest 2 they re stooopid to have brought it out it s non innovative i ll only upgrade my quest2 in 2 years from now or if apple comes out with their version of vr  ar why would anyone in their right minds upgrade to a pico 4 i meant pinnocchio 4>>><<<got my pico 4 yesterday and left eye have 1 dead pixel in center lol sometimes i see it rare but it is what it is >>><<<hi mike i am a new subscriber i know absolutely nothing about gaming i had no interest in gaming but after just turning 60 i have been discouraged by my physical health which has kept me from travel as i want too so i decided for now to travel in vr you are the 1st video i came upon in looking for a headset so the other day i went and bought a quest 2 and the head and face thingy is you use on yours i have also gotten very interested in games by watching your videos thank you for all the great information on all these amazing products this advanced card maker lol is moving into a new world and it is all your fault  your channel is amazing >>><<<wait wait the pico recording is native 16 9 with a decent fov >>><<<idk the pico 4 seems better than the quest 2 now but how is it gonna hold up when the quest 3 comes out>>><<<if this headset could connect with displayport i would have bought it but compressed makes it not worth switching out my reverb>>><<<so as a replacement for the rift s its good i am looking forward to cutting the wire with the bonus of getting to keep my oculus library via virtual desktop >>><<<yeet>>><<<yeet>>><<<ah yes chinese spyware >>><<<you lost me at owned by same company as tiktok so it is just a chinese version of the quest 2 got it >>><<<china>>><<<0 chance china is not weaponizing this as a spy tool zero >>><<<i m coming from quest 1 it will be a generational leap forward can t wait for it to arrive x >>><<<man i kinda wanna consider getting this over the quest 2 how much does it cost though >>><<<this guy reminds me of dantdm>>><<<i have a question can u play roblox on pick 4 >>><<< 1 56 my ocd kicks in i wanna remove that hair>>><<<i think i just wasted my money child as a young one by buying the quest 2 is this true>>><<<the really dropped the ball without dp on this one so sad>>><<<bytedance fuck that this is a ccp spy tool hard pass >>><<<see they released a headset but now you already bought a bunch of games on the quest 2 so youre not gonna switch anyway>>><<<look ik that people are saying pico is better but keep in mind quest 2 came out 3 years ago remember pico has flaws that quest does not>>><<<i thought this was bill burr>>><<<scalpers will destroy all consumer products for some products to be successful like game consoles and vr headsets you need as much of them possible in the hands of actual consumers example the new pico 4 vr headset to have developers create content for it it has to be in the hands of as many people as possible with every single one scalped the sh t out of there is not a single one on the market eventhough the original price of a 256 gig version is 500 bucks amazon is scalp devision sells them at 900 bucks and are already sold out permanently making the future of it as bleak as the ps5 in one generation of scalping game consoles are dead vr will go the same way in the end we will have nothing left we are witnessing the end of popular consumer products the only way to stop this is sell one per verified person at the normal retail price companies are to shortsighted to see how just selling everything to scalpers will kill their own products in the future it is sickening i really wanted to buy a ps5 but gave up on that years ago i am not paying a scalper anything i hope they get stuck with tons of unsold sh t and die in a fire nobody should pay these a  les a single penny i will probably never get my hands on a pico 4 vr either and have to exept my dated quest 2 will be the last standalone vr i will ever own and with no playerbase any software sales depended products are dead on arrival the solution is simple and starts at the companies that manufacture them stop selling in bulk to non consumers ffs >>><<<having aspherical lenses is a huge plus imo it should greatly improve the sweet spot in addition the fresnel type lenses always seem to give me a headache they cause tons of visible distortion i hope we see more headsets going to smooth glass lenses >>><<<i do not like because controller using aa battery i want rechargeable battery like the controller of sony and xbox>>><<<i am looking for a device which has a better resolution and fov than q2 to play dcs without breaking my bank account this may be the one >>><<< 1 16 lcd displays ist saying display twice >>><<<the only question i have is why on earth would you use a grenade to open a door and then waste another one on a single zombie are you made of grenades >>><<<that was a great thorough review mike thank you >>><<<same company as tiktok gross get this trash our of here from a trash company>>><<<beat saber isn t on it so hard pass>>><<< these chinese dudes are so op >>><<<i am going nowhere near this just for the fact that this company has already been caught access american user data i do not want to give the chinese government access to inside my house facebook is bad enough>>><<<it is bad the head strap is not removable and it is not a snug enough fit it is unusable laying down>>><<<it is actually not the display less bright it is the pancake lenses that make the image more dim>>><<<thanks very good review >>><<<i got my pico 4 about 48 hours ago and yesterday there were many more games than day before in the store so the content issue might be outdated soon and i love it very comfortable for my head and the pcvr streaming is awesome rtx 3080 with 1000 mbit router so much better than my f ing vive cosmos with a cable just not great for sim racing since those games in vr brings down every system without 4090 to it is knees already without streaming but it was playable and the input lag probably similar or even less than with v sync on a pancake but no problem with hl alyx and finally a great experience in this game >>><<<its nice to compare quest 2 release 13 10 2020 vs pico 4 release 15 10 2022 and say that its almost the same parameters xd>>><<<i have the pico myself and just wanted to say i think the tracking isnt great with movement i noticed when i opened the pico menu or library the screen is slightly moving and doesnt feel as stable as on the quest 2 lets hope it wil get fixed in some update but its really weird noone has noticed this >>><<<i believe that pico is on the right track just ironing out the bumps but with a little help from the community and devs i think that this will be a vr headset that will push the boundaries of vr call me dumb but i see a bright future for them well done to pico amp great video mate just sad that im broke i would loved to used this pico 4  >>><<<power adapter how mich w >>><<<freality not the same anymore hope you return in the near future>>><<<must be nice to be able to afford an oculus anyway love the content keep it up bro>>><<<i do not trust chinese companiese or companiese related to chinese fund so i will not buy this however competition is good thing for consumers whatsoever nice review as always >>><<<hey there i mainly would play steam vr games and only had a quest 2 for a month some time would you recommend the pico 4 for me or would you recommend me to wait for a 4 pro >>><<<if you were to use vr with link cable to pc so you can run wired steam games wou not the audio come out of your pc does this mean you can use wireless 2 4 headphones with dongle example steelseries 7 or higher to have much lower latency >>><<<basically a pancake quest in more ways than one flater overall headset and flat lenses>>><<<after all that shady stuff byte dance did also with the upcoming eye tracking do not believe i could trust this maker>>><<<i am confused the internet connection is that so you can play games directly from the pico 4 website without a pc or is that for down loading soft wear  >>><<<this is a great review for someone trying to decide between a pico 4 and quest 2 for their first vr headset virtual desktop makes the investment worth it as it gets around the lack of pico store apps by letting you use those from the quest store as for there being no audio jack i would recommend the ad adtrip usb c splitter it is slightly long but very affordable and better than the 2 port adapters available >>><<<the larger sweet spot fov and this resolution is really tempting over the q2 their next headset should be amazing they have earned their place >>><<<slippery and extremely undermining road for vr in general this approach that this us meta are using by banning the best standalone vr titles from other stand alone devices it will create tensions like we also see on xbox and playstation with certain people using an extremely black amp white perspective depending on which fraction your into bed with  why not let as many people as posiible be able to enjoy good content and do not have to purchase another expensive vr headset just to play certain titles that could easily be played on a product they alreayd have with the exact same soc and android based os not to mention the e waste but its us meta facebook common logic and simply having an eye on the biggger picture and the greater good for the masses useally do not take center there i do not have a vr headset but not a fan of that rancid meta approach >>><<<comfort and light leakage was my biggest issue with it too having a big nose i also found it dug into my nose too i would definitely consider buying again i returned it if there is a decent 3rd party facial interface but i suspect it could be quite a wait as most 3rd party companies are probably going to wait and see how it sells first >>><<<sounds a bit familiar>>><<<i see that little atf juggy in there wicked review >>><<<no 3 5 mm jack is instant nope>>><<<bought this absolutely awful lets light in from the sides so you can see the room in the lenses downloaded one game war planes which i played on the quest 2 writing was blurry controls way too sensitive tried to watch amazon prime movies just a blank screen with sound most disappointing was the environment very basic even typing on the virtual keyboard was awful if you wanted to use special characters like or dollar compared to the quest 2 it was night and day the quest 2 is like a smart phone the pico 4 is like a nokia 5190 for those of us who are old enough to remember them it was so dreadful i have sold it after a day >>><<<only problem for me is lack of gamez>>><<<great review i only heard about pico recently i have looked into index htc etc and have a quest2 but i needed to know something on this one covered all the bases love your work >>><<<is there a way to buy and play lone echo 2 on pico 4 >>><<<good review i will stick with the three quest 2 is we use in my house mine and my 2 daughters video definitely deserved a like >>><<<my pico 4 arrived today setting everything up reminded me of when i did the same routine with the quest 2 in 2020 only this time i was not struggling to find the sweet spot constantly adjusting the headset avoiding scratching the lenses with my glasses suffering the face plate pressed against my face determined to really enjoy this new vr experience i bought the q2 mainly to watch tv and films on a huge screen with total immersion i never got that faceplate after face plate strap after strap counter weight after counter weight little did i know that my stubbornness would last over 18 months until i gave up on it it will soon be on ebay and good riddance to it now having learned with the q2 i was wary of the p4 but right out of the box i felt that same childlike eagerness to use it as i felt with the quest but this time i was not disappointed it is so much better than the q2 so much lighter and the sweet spot is huge yes the faceplate is a little rough but it is not clamped to my face as the quest was and wearing glasses is easy peezy the longest i wore the q2 was 40 minutes and most of that time was spent adjusting the headset i lost track of time with the p4 tonight you know it is there but it is not dominating your time in vr i know i can never have those two years back but with this unit i will certainly try to make up for that lost time >>><<<my pico 4 arrived yesterday thankfully it took a while to get it comfy but then i did not suffer the same issues as mike i have had a 0g quest and usually rock a reverb g2 but wanted some cable free action not as visually impressive as the g2 but everything else ticks the right boxes and it is not meta woot right now virtual desktop is a must have though the pico option is not up to the task at time of writing >>><<<yes the is back>>><<<so in a few words not worth an upgrade>>><<<argh no audio jack everyone keeps making the same booby  but most will use the built in speakers i guess i can not remember the amount of times i regret buying a phone with no headphone jack after losing all those usb c to 3 5 adaptors it does look really good though me wants >>><<<an actual balanced review of the pico 4 i have seen some other channels discuss it and suggest should i upgrade to the pico 4 from the quest 2 with the implication that its clearly better all around my initial thoughts were it doesnt make sense for me to switch horses for such a modest gain especially with the cost ive sunk into stand alone games and it seems to kind of bare out as true i guess it is nice to have another device out there though even if it isnt the right choice for me currently thanks for the review >>><<<software looks just like quests>>><<<damn kind of wish i got a pico instead of the quest 2 my main gripe being the ipd i batter to get that sweet spot as its in between the 3 shitty click settings >>><<<i own a quest 1 and i was thinking about the quest pro however that was back when we still thought it would be around 800 usd i might pick up the pico 4 pro since it will have all the fancy stuff and the software will be more mature>>><<<how much is it in money no gbp>>><<<i would consider this a clear upgrade if the new quest pro controllers did not exist anything that uses led strips just seems primitive by comparison >>><<<nice honest review pico 4 is a fantastic standalone headset for me i am very much into pcvr and while this seems to give a good experience i already own a g2 and the through the lens footage on the internet is showing the g2 significan notly better if i were to buy a standalone headset i would probably get the quest pro over the pico 4 as the mixed reality experience really fascinates me i am not sure but why could not pico have provided 2 colour passthrough cameras for a 3d stereoscopic display >>><<<i have never had a vr headset but i can afford either a quest 2 or a poco 4 i want to primarily game so which one do you recommend >>><<<thanks for the honest review everyone else seems to be over hyping the image quality nice to hear that it is about on par with quest 2 i will stick to my aero >>><<<would it be a good idea to buy pico 4 when you already have a quest 2 >>><<<i do not want to support a bytedance ccp headset >>><<<did not know it was owned by the tik token company can we get an affordable vr that does not have people constantly gathering our info ffs lol is not tik tok in trouble for gathering face data and now they are getting this directly on your face >>><<<my ipd is not quite symmetrical i wonder how much of a difference it would make to be able to move each lens independently relative to the nose of my bridge >>><<<the only question i have is does it come black i am only half serious but i really do hate white hardware it gets dirty way too quick and i am not the kind of person that constantly wipes everything down every time i use it >>><<< 13 23 mrtv show some adapter 3 5mm and type c in one device so there are solution already >>><<<you take your tea the same as i do hey mike your videos are so nicely done hi to your puppy and family >>><<<in 10 years time we will realize we have been wearing vr contact lenses for the past 2000 years but we just forgot to take them off >>><<<super disappointed there is not a headphone jack that is the one thing i needed >>><<< 8 40 the same problem i had with pico neo 3 link i sold it already and ordered pico 4 but you are the 1st reviewer who said about this problem >>><<<well it is a quest killer for me as i will sell my quest 2 for only one reason the quest is very uncomfortable to wear so i rarely use it i even play much more with the old psvr 1 the pico is my new pcvr headset and the coming psvr 2 will be my main headset for gaming being comfortable for longer than just a few minutes is very important for me i have quite a huge head maybe the quest is more acceptable if you have a smaller head do not know >>><<<i just had to send back my quest 2 because the controller drifted and i am planning on buying these so how is the quality the dead pixel scares me and my glasses are big and had problems to use them in quest 2 space inside in pico is better >>><<<looking to finally get into vr so what is the current generation beyond those from last year i plan to buy late this year or 2023 so i am wondering if i should wait or who is the front runner or best bang for the buck in the us >>><<<i have just got a rift s still is this headset much of an improvement over that i do not really play games on these only would use for vr simulation and racing flying sims >>><<<love the competition i am hoping wifi 6e in newer headsets will improve wireless pcvr streaming lightweight wireless vr is the dream for quality>>><<< 2 37 the exact moment that my dreams of having a great vr headset without the downsides of the quest 2 were shattered>>><<<you can still order it for amazon here in the states it just will take longer to get here with that headset it seems like it has all the same problems that the quest to have when it first launched so once we start getting third party accessories i am sure it will make that headset much more comfortable>>><<<well there are some new headphones that you can use that were made for virtual reality and their bluetooth which i am sure you already know about>>><<<not a great alternative when it is own by yet another social media company >>><<<quote you do not need a tictoc account to use it yeah not yet that is exactly what oculus promised when they were bought out by facebook i have a reddit response from palmer lucky himself promising that >>><<<if they added a displyport this would have been the vr headset for literally everyone>>><<<bytedance privacy is my concern >>><<<i have bought one today its for xmas  >>><<<quest 2 loader is the killer >>><<<ty for the video if i have some games on the oculus do i need to buy them again for the pico >>><<<i would like to hear in the review about tests how much data does it transfer to china what data is stored on chinese servers >>><<<great product no library of top titles so interim pass for sure >>><<<typical strongly negatively biased review from a vr youtuber who is paid from meta simply ridiculous >>><<<so i have a q1 would you say that i should rather go for q2 or pico 4 100percent pc vr is going to be a factor for me>>><<<thank you for the detailed review >>><<<i think what is cool about the motorised ipd is that if different people use it they can just use their accounts>>><<<yeah i have a dead pixel on my quest 2 ugh>>><<<i am getting pico4 in 4 days i hope >>><<<nice review finally someone notices the similarity with the pico and ready player one lol my only concern is motion sickness as that is what is been putting me off buying any vr headset>>><<<dang the editing is  >>><<<a great review and as a long time follower and owner of psvr oculus rift oculus go oculus quest and quest 2 i have enjoyed keeping up with vr information i ordered my pico 4 and recieved it yesterday launch day and very impressed with the visuals i have slowly but surely moved to more games via the pc with steam and cross buy of the oculus meta games means many are now available to my pc only a few star wars games limited to quest 2 so i will be keeping this competition is a good thing to have so i really welcome this release also with the headphone adaptor you can find a longer version usb c to headphone with charging upto 60w on amazon if you want to add that option >>><<<please someone make a non stand alone headset again i do not want to pay for heavier headset with high tech chips i am never gonna use>>><<<it is made by bytedance why the f would i sell my soul the chinese spy party >>><<<it is gonna be so cool if sidequest could work on pico devices>>><<<cheers for not clickbaiting quest 2 killer  >>><<<looks like a great competitor i look forward to seeing what they do to it in the future that being said i will probably stick with my quest 2 as i already have a good library that i would rather not have to repurchase >>><<<do not forget the pico pro>>><<< 15 25 ahahahahahahahahah>>><<<fantastic review covered all the things i wanted to learn about the headset thanks>>><<<is this available in the us >>><<<i need to know i am getting a vr headset for standalone games not pcvr which headset should i get please help right now i am looking and pico 4 and meta quest 2 please let me know>>><<<beatsaber will not be coming any time soon lol >>><<<wait the wired image quality is worse than wireless what is the point of having the wired option then what is it for just for people who like falling over some wires >>><<<great video thanks because of this excellent review i am binning my quest 2 and getting a pico 4 >>><<<is it going to acquire titles like bonelab beatsaber stuff like that in the future >>><<<i still have the oculus rift cv1 and i am looking for an low price alternative to connect to my pc the rift2 is not anvailable in my country and i need alot of space for my glasses or special lenses for the vr system most intern visionadaptation is not enough for me to get a clear picture the large gabs on the side sounds nice for my big head maybe the pico 4 is the one i was looking for but are there anny protectors for the lenses anvailable as i said my glases are special and on oculus rift i tapt the lenses alot with may glasses until i got a pare of bonus lenses in my vision parameters i am scared of scratshing the lenses >>><<<they literally copied quest 2 is whole system ui it is from china we are not surprised>>><<<pico will not be getting advanced chip like meta in the future >>><<<i hate meta but i also hate bytedance gimme a headset that is not backed by a shadowy cabal plz>>><<<i get motion sick af it is my first vr headset and i am not convinced at all by vr after that first use yesterday the image is really bad blurry when you need to read text or stuff i tried every setting of the lenses it gets close but still shitty maybe my face is just weird will test with the spacer again later maybe that helps but as for now meh better wait 1 2 more yrs >>><<<quest 2 is way batter >>><<<how would it look choppy when the video is only at 30fps >>><<<i like mike but this is yet another mainstream review laden with caveats to appease meta the take home for me is this as a pcvr headset it is superior to the quest 2 it is cheaper it is more enjoyable watching media content on the pico 4 than it is in the quest 2 the controllers are superior in terms of tracking sure you could argue it is not a quest 2 killer but it is definitely not it is equal it is superior the only point i would concede is the software features need some work too many meta ambassadors on yt with one eye on zuck >>><<<dead pixel on arrival i hope i will be lucky with my unit i enjoyed dead pixels with my pimax and i do not want to experience it again great review >>><<<get pico 4 or wait for psvr2 sold my quest 2 and do not want to get another one at this point >>><<<hey vr oasis excellent review have you tried the usb type c 3 5mm adapters that allow pass through charging there are a quite a few adapters on amazon for example >>><<<is there a way to have your quest 2 library on your pico 4 >>><<<the original pico neo 3 non link supported the vr usb c port on the 2000 series nvidia cards    does this one support that feature >>><<<know htc vive are teasing a new headset if it is ther same as the pico 4 but with wigig 2 wifi that would make me happy as good pc wireless headset with low latency wigig2 wouldd be nice>>><<<just unboxed my pico 4 and my first impression was disappointed the face cushion is so stiff it pressed my face much more than the quest 2 i did not feel it light at all it also left ugly marks on my face just after a few minutes of play terrible  there was no tracking at all until i set the boundaries it made me feel dizzy the worst bug if i shake my head quickly the whole scene moves with my head like there was no tracking at all this does not happen with the quest 2 very annoying  the color pass through is also very bad objects that are 1 5m tall were displayed as flat on the floor the depth sensor is clearly missing without that it is a mess overall the pico 4 is a huge disappointment i think i will cry  and will sell it as soon as i can >>><<<i love watching movies in vr and for me this would be a compelling buy but  no headphone jack is a deal breaker i will pass sadly >>><<<this is the first time i heard someone mention the controllers having capacitive sensors which not having them was a major con for me at first so if this is true i have nothing to worry about in vrchat>>><<<i own a quest 2 and do not need this at the moment but even if i considered buying it i would not do it it because of the lack of headphone jack it is a big con for me >>><<<what i think about pico 4 is they must have a better option in anyway than quest 2 if not this headset will not have a competitive value and its not a quest killer but how to survived from quest 2 not killed after they launch and sell their headset thats what my opinion>>><<<tbh i would feel kinda scammed buying this >>><<<seems crazy you can not plug headphones in>>><<< loving your in depth review buddy been a fan for ages this cements you as an honest non biased reviewer respect lee marvin hitchman ladbible shaun attwood neil samworth is real porridge etc >>><<<how to connect pico 4 to tv >>><<<lol it reminds me of the vive focus 3>>><<<as you said you could not try the fitness app or parties pre release now it is released can you comment on these features did the pass through get any better moving from os 5 0 to 5 2 0 >>><<<thanks for the great review was really looking forward to seeing this i hope the headset does well and brings more people to vr definitely a competitor at a reasonable price >>><<<imagine in 12 months when quest 3 releases probably the pico 5 will too if the latter has eye tracking it might be a game changer at least for pc vr users >>><<<nice one mike>>><<<can not wait for your arpara review>>><<<the lack of an audio jack is a deal breaker for me>>><<<i can not help but think the reviewer was underwhelmed i have ordered one purely because the quest 2 has a single screen whereas the pico 4 has two dedicated screens which is perfect for those of us with a larger ipd this is a big deal but was glossed over here >>><<<thanks for the review mike and for covering the pcvr section in such detail cheers >>><<<it may not have beat saber but it does have smash drums with 3 extra songs >>><<<there is an issue with the lenses surprised you did not mention it more it is fine when gaming but really noticable in the home environments and when the keyboard and menu systems>>><<<why does the interface look like the quests lol>>><<<bought my new quest 2 at 349euros sold it last week at 349euros when i saw the pico 4 but i am not buying it now i will wait sometimes to see the evolution but if i needed a vr headset now i would definitely choose the pico 4 for the people who say the quest is better fuck pico you are just mad you bought a quest for the same price or higher these are both good headset but the pancake lenses and the weight distribution would be enough for me to go for the pico the quest 2 is not enjoyable with the original strap and all that weight on the nose althought i do not have a giant nose without the glass spacer i could not use the quest 2 cause of the pain alleluja >>><<<looks like someone got our back for when meta will inevitably go bankrupt due to all the stupid s they are doing right now d thanks for the in depth and complete review do not apologise for the long video >>><<< owned by bytedance that is where i turned off the video >>><<<hi does it work with quest 2 is pirated apps games >>><<<comfort is a biggie for me cf q2>>><<<thank you for honest review the front foam feels very comfortable to me maybe we have differently shaped heads but there is a bit of light leakage on the sides also you can use both link cable and audio jack using hub >>><<<damn i bought quest 2 a week ago should i sell it or keep it >>><<<isnt it horrible youd need to repurchase your entire games library absolute deal breaker>>><<<128 or 256 >>><<<something i am struggling with when it comes to vr like quest or peco these companies are not the most trustworthy having data and privacy issues but make such appealing vr products >>><<<how can pico shamelessly copy entire quest ui to their headset as if that is a ok thing>>><<<looks like you beat thrill to it damn>>><<<nice review and thorough review i got myself the pico 4 after testing it at a roadshow its quite abit cheaper in my region compared to the quest 2 and way more comfortable i do have to say in regards to your point about fit vr is a very personal thing and fits different people differently i have a rounder and bigger head so the pico 4 fits me perfectly with zero light leaks whereas the quest 2 was way too snug and pinching the area around my eyes so my advice is always try to find a test unit first to try out the fit before buying>>><<<can i play gorilla tag on it >>><<<thanks for honest review mate for sure vrcover and bobovr had cook something of their sleeve for this bad boy >>><<<my god the shiny black front was sucking the fingerprints right off me just watching the video my vr upgrade had been long overdue and i have been watching the pico with great interest but i think i will be looking around for a decent second hand quest 2 and wait for the psvr 2 for the main course awesome video as always >>><<<great for some amogus vr>>><<<it is not an alternative but a better option >>><<<quest 2 better than pico 4 it is true>>><<<the meta exclusive games are not the horizon zero dawn type of games so i will not miss one of them i think in the long run the pico store will be superior if the devs can sell in china too i will get the pico 4 today bye bye dusty quest2 >>><<<hey mike is there a new podcast for you that i can catch you on >>><<<cool i will wait for the quest 3 thank you >>><<<oh boy i have been waiting for this video let me just drop the kid off to school and get comfortable >>><<<samsung where are you >>><<<looks like a true bootleg>>><<<finally a real assessment is it worth reselling your quest 2 to pico 4 not sure you know i bought a belt for the waist 3 months ago made in china it only lasted 2 months to break i have never bought something that comes from china and is of good quality we see it here with the deadpixel cheap products cheap parts pay you for what you have for those who ordered a pico 4 from america good luck with warranty and returns >>><<<still waiting for the pimax crystal>>><<<owned by tiktok that is enough information a communist company that collects data on users >>><<<sail is coming soon to pico vr >>><<<you know i really think this headset seems good but there is one thing the fact that the quest 2 has a replaceable headstrap is so good because mine is battery is pooped and only lasts an hour but now i have a confortable headstrap with hot swappable battery backs and i havent had to worry about charge since i am sure solutions like that will come to the pico 4 but ima keep my quest 2 with infinite battery edit i finished the video and i see that bobovr has already done it but no interchangeable headstrap >>><<<i live in china so not needing to use a vpn to use this instead of the quest is tempting >>><<<solid review but i am still considering replacing my quest2 with the pico4 simply because the visual sweetspot is too small on the quest2 and it is too front heavy >>><<<if i was not so deep into the quest 2 with the shear amount of games i have purchased i would totally have bought this it seems better in terms of hardware in almost every way compared to the quest 2 >>><<<good evening mike great review video on the pico 4 i deftly looking into getting a headset that can do both pc vr and standalone vr have a good evening mike >>><<<how is the comfort in quest 2 out of the box its more expensive headset and i hear you have to buy elite strap because its so uncomfortable >>><<<i hope they release a narcissistic app that lets me dance like an idiot in my living room>>><<<definitely more competition is welcome although i am a little concerned about how byte dance owns pico i hope privacy is some what at a respectable level and not turn into tiktok and collect and sell user data and provide it to the chinese government  sure meta is just as bad but i trust meta with my data more then a chinese company who collects more data from tiktok then every other social media around >>><<<one of the biggest arguments for the pico is for me the huge sweet spot this should really improve the experience>>><<<surprised you you did not say anything about not being able to switch head straps since you have a love affair with your bobo strap >>><<<that is a nice looking headset i still have the first oculus quest but not sure whether to wait>>><<<chinese communist party vr headset no thanks>>><<<not a quest 2 killer easy the games ok did not have to watch the whole video bye  oh also probably the software but we all forget quest 2 took 2 years  to get where it is now>>><<<i received mine last week and im loving it for once i can buy games in my currency it was way more comfortable than the meta ones and the face cushion wasnt as bad for me and the weight my god so light my only gripe is the controller buttons do not feel as premium as quest but thats a minor feeling i do also wish it had more productivity and leisure apps on their store>>><<<why in the world would they not include the headphone jack that is kind of dumb in my opinion >>><<<hey mike is the ability to just load up apk files and install them on the headset easily still in this one cheers >>><<<sucks if you have a quest and want this you will have to buy all the games again>>><<<i currently have a quest 1 99percent of the time i am playing pc vr content wirelessly would you recommend the pico 4 or quest 2 as an upgrade >>><<<great video loved hearing your insight on this product curious if they will ever come to the states>>><<<does this run android like the quest 2 >>><<<if all these devices are going to have their own exclusive game stores then i am not buying any of them pcvr for life >>><<< 13 24 usb c audio amp charge adapter product id cdp2capdm>>><<<there in adapter from ugreen 3 5mm and usb c both i have it it works great for about 16 dollars>>><<<holy i did not realized it looked like the one from ready player one>>><<< 4 33 72hz is smooth >>><<<i ordered my pico 4 a week ago on aliexpress from china still havnt got it as it only shipped yesterday but hey i still get it early compared to the october 18th release being in usa im hella stoked for it most exited for the comfort and combination of the best 2 headsets the quest 2 tracking and hp reverb resolution >>><<<quest 2 better>>><<<thank you for not making clickbaity junk and just doing a straight to the point review >>><<<nothing with tiktok associations nope>>><<<who here is buying the quest pro>>><<<wait is bill burr doing product reviews >>><<< 4 37 well pancake lenses make it darker and less vibrant 11 27 not gonna lie i have seen a million reviews for that thing already and you have been the only one to mention that so far 11 31 i like that idea taking screenshots in the quest is a pain in the plot i guess those controllers do not have capacitive sensors though 12 05 seems to be a legit design but then the touch pros do not have tracking rings at all and those are compatible with the q2 12 11 bonelabs street puncher mike imma gonna punch them with lead to the head 12 24 honestly i did not expect that because of the cheapo look and i somehow thought those would have to be transparent for that for some reason probably all the controllers with that feature so far having transparent buttons  13 17 afaik there are adapters that have a passthrough usb c port that can not pass through data though so at least it is possible to have an additional battery pack but not corded link 15 43 cries in germany d had to get it from france having a tokyo drift controller and no support probably just trying to get the pro controllers right away instead of bothering getting that one replaced somehow  16 10 yeah bytedance fricken xicoms for anyone jumping on the train now after not getting a quest 2 because of teh zucc being a lizard selling your precious data this is not an alternative btw >>><<<just do not expect a wired pcvr option that is all i use my quest 2 for >>><<<if we where scared about our privacy with facebook buying oculus imagine buying a headset made by fckin tiktok>>><<<if you were seeing the dead pixel in the recording does not that mean it is a software thing not an issue with the screen >>><<<i had a quest 2 from launch and recently moved abroad but did not bring the headset with me i fancied another and had to choose between buying another quest and keeping my old game library or trying out the new pico glad i went for the pico where i live it is about gbp70 cheaper than the quest but with the lenses screens and other more modern hardware i had to give it a try it really is a nice upgrade over the quest 2 especially in the comfort and weight but you are definitely right about software hopefully the updates keep coming out i am just happy there is competition now it will push everyone forward >>><<<thanks >>><<<let is call it the meta killer instead>>><<<q2 has noticeable sde with movies >>><<<i wish we can get the pico in the us >>><<<if not in the oculus ecosystem it is media looks better movies and pc gaming seems better >>><<<will bonelab be coming to the pico 4 >>><<<this definitely has my interest when it comes to the us i like my quest 2 but the addition of competitors finally is awesome and i am considering getting one once more games come to it i have a lot of quest games for that headset only not on pc that i would lose though sadly that is a shame great video mike >>><<<you can get an adapter that has both usb c charging and audio jack those have been around since apple started the remove the headphone jack trend years ago did you have a beta build of the os5 which was released on the 18th or did you only get to use the os4 that it ships with >>><<<can you play crescendo on rec room with pico 4>>><<<great honest review the best yet i must say the pico 4 is the most best looking vr headset so far it has so much style >>><<<this is a superior product not just an alternative >>><<<is it worth buying >>><<<i have a quest 2 and the battery is almost shot is it possible to change the internal battery >>><<<i can see that the chinese state government has comprised you unsubcribing >>><<<soundcore vr p10 wireless gaming earbuds you should check these out for headphones>>><<<i would ask if you have any estimate for the release of the pico 4 pro maybe>>><<<i live in south africa and have been stuck with a second hand semi broken rift cv1 i decided to bite the bullet and order one from amazon with import costs i am very excited to basically double my resolution and maybe even go wireless >>><<<always leave a cheeky little like >>><<<i am most interested with the performance it is trying to push more pixels does the performance suffer games like b amp s n are taxing for the quest2 but what about for this >>><<<i cannot believe there is no headphone jack >>><<<wish it released in the us >>><<<i see the graphical upgrade in blade and sorcery graphics>>><<<got my one playing in morning >>><<<great vid bro doing the rounds currently>>><<<mike can you play android games and programs on the pico aka plex youtube third party 3d flat screen apps amp is there any chance of reverse wireless display for example taking a samsung or huawei and having their desktop mode beamed into pico or a desktop mode >>><<<heavens never apologise for a review being longer than usual provided it is timestamped there is no such thing as too long or detailed for a review >>><<<i may upgrade to this from my rift s when vr lens are available for it>>><<< 14 25 >>><<<the software looks like a blatant knockoff of the oculus quest ui>>><<<can you even trust a company that made tiktok all these oj simpson companies rubbing shekels on your data >>><<<is there any software or something to test if our internet is good enough for virtual desktop >>><<<what i see as missteps for pico no headphone jack no link version headset having the same name as the company edit it is the pico pico 4 >>><<<the pancake lenses are the reason it is less bright that will be something that all pancake style headsets suffer from either less bright or larger battery required >>><<<i am a simple guy i see no bin in thumbnail i click i like positive video >>><<<i am very sensitive to latency over wi fi what was the lowest possible latency you could achieve using virtual desktop >>><<<so much smaller then the quest 2  why do you compare them without the light shield it is not like they can be used without what kind of bias review is this >>><<<what about watching movies is it better than quest 2 i enjoy using big screen and other videos apps on quest no one has said anything about movie quality so just curious thanks>>><<<do you need a pc for it and do you need one for the cambria bc i will purchase that when it gets out>>><<<i wonder how it works on linux and if not now ift it will later>>><<<i am still rocking a rift s and i have not been very happy with it but i also do not wanna buy a quest 2 this might be my new headset it seems pretty darn good >>><<<is the pico better than the quest 2 >>><<<i am considering it but i am poor lol >>><<<if they fix that link quality and somebody makes a 3rd party face cover then it seems perfect>>><<< 10 15 why would a dead pixel show up on the recording sounds more like a software issue >>><<<great review look forward to the pro version>>><<<not worth it quest 2 still superior >>><<<the pico would be my very first vr headset sooo did i get it right that i can play beat saber and other games via steam >>><<<thanks for the review mike can you in your view can you tell us how this unit compares to the psvr2 thank you in advance >>><<<nobody mentions if you login to social apps do you find friends from oculus there does it login to the same social media servers as oculus >>><<<hey guys i am just thinking about buying my first vr headset i am thinking about pico 4 more sice i will play pc vr mostly but since i never had any vr headset i do not know how all this sw works i understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms but let is say i want to play beat saber i can play it via pcvr but what about lone echo somewhere i came across information that quest games can be run normally on pc via their app and then streamed to the headset via vr desktop so is it possible to play quest 2 exclusive games this way on pico 4 or do i have to resign myself to losing these games >>><<<swag man>>><<<if pico and pico pro manage to supply the world demand it will crush the quest pro>>><<<is there any news on this headset releasing to north america >>><<<got my pico 4 today it is a definite hardware upgrade over the quest 2 biggest things i like are the lens and comfort the face gasket has slight light bleed which is annoying but overall if you do not have any vr headset pico 4 is the way to go now for the foreseeable future >>><<<i bet the guys at pico were very happy when meta announced the msrp of the quest 2 was raised from euros349 to euros449 >>><<<i have a rift s i am looking for an upgrade but maybe i will wait for quest 3 or something the resolution and fov on the rift s are pretty bad nowadays >>><<<i would buy it if it got 120 hz >>><<<for the pico 4 i found for my head that if i raise the headstrap a little bit higher than what feels intuitive i get a much more even pressure distribution on the facial interface i also had the exact same experience with wired wireless pcvr streaming it seems to be locked to 40mbps streaming and the detail is noticably poor until i keep still for about a second or two virtual desktop is significan notly better to the point where i can play even while using a less than ideal router the battery life should definitely be more like 8000mah out of the box but besides that i am loving it >>><<<on vrchat ppl keep saying its the best yet it just came out and 99 99percent of them never try it>>><<<alos mike any news on pico 4 pro >>><<<this or psvr2 >>><<<are there free games on the pico store >>><<<is it normal that i lost 20percent of battery only in 20min with pico 4 >>><<< a cheeky little like on the video >>><<<how come your content is so similar to other youtube channels like cas and chary vr it seems like you both put out almost exactly the same videos is there some youtube oculus or company sponsorship going on >>><<<perhaps you should buy one for a fan of the channel when you get sent these early so you actually have some skin in the game i feel like your review would be more believable and also more true to form on what it will be like for retail people to actually buy it could improve the whole experience not saying you are lying but i feel like reviewers really do not seem to realize that there is an extreme risk for you to have an unconscious bias when this is the set up for review you seem like a really nice guy just some food for thought perhaps p s i am not trying to get your free stuff give it to one of these kids or someone with less money who can not afford one if anything i am flawed too not saying i am not >>><<<do you recommend any specific site to buy it im located in mexico im going to buy a headset and i was on the fence between quest 2 or pico 4 will be mainly using it for pcvr>>><<<mike what is the ps5 vr like compared topico4 hp reverb g2 plz no one else has mentioned them  keep up the good work m8>>><<<me wow mike is such a wholesome youtuber mike motions middle finger up and down me wtf >>><<<preordered one coming from the original quest wanted something for pc vr as well as getting out of the meta ecosystem before getting sucked in completely let is see how it goes looks promising at least>>><<<were not there just yet but 2025 will be insane>>><<<thanks mike great video as ever completion in the vr space can only be a good thing i have a quest 2 and am hoping that the quest 3 can learn from the quest pro i know the quest 3 is not a pro upgrade i mean tech wise for gaming and pico 4 to be a real step up hopefully next year >>><<<i was about to buy the neo 4 until i saw that vrchat was not on pico store i love my quest but i need the pico for the ipd and i also wanna try the new controllers so sad about not being able to play vrchat on the pico >>><<<wow pico straight up cloned the quest 2 software >>><<<100percent we will see vr goggles the size of sunglasses within 5 years >>><<<was really hoping that the pico would be comfortable so that i can forget that im wearing it during a movie >>><<<would virtual desktop work with the link cable or with the dongle adapter pico is going to release >>><<<stop recommending these products to people it is literally owned by the ccp it is not care about permissions it steals everything it can and very very soon as soon as conflict breaks out they have no obligation to continue supporting it software wise these are the same people that blatantly steal copyrighted materials left and right on a daily basis look at the headset itself for fuck sakes it is a quest to with a black strip in the bottom that was developed without having to innovate anything simply using hardware that is 3 years more advantageous because of when it came out and then comparing them like they are apples and oranges any money you send to them leaves the country and never comes back and fuels the war machine you have an ethical obligation to not push this crap>>><<<i was very pumped to see a non quest headset until i saw it was made by tiktok pass >>><<<upgrading from a rift s i feel like i am gonna need some extra stuff like vr desktop and maybe even the bobovr batteries to not have it be a downgrade from direct pcvr yet for wireless tech aswell as how fed up i am with my worsening set i would buy it one way or another shame a 20dollar software is the only good method for pc streaming tho real surprised pico is own app is not as good >>><<<mike great review as always i primarily use quest 2 for pcvr and you mentioned it is not a generational leap forward however given the better lenses and better resolution will i notice a significan not clarity difference and is beat saber properly playable at something like expert where very fast movement is necessary i keep hearing the video compression is really bad and virtual desktop is the way forward is it good enough for beat saber and similar games in your opinion >>><<<great review mike love how everyone flips the bird when showing hand tracking lol >>><<<my wifi is 530mbps download and 30 40mbps upload is that good enough for virtual desktop >>><<<great vid can not wait for mine to arrive d>>><<<what personal data do you need to give for a pico account>>><<<facebook  tik tok  >>><<<wow no headphone jack what a trash design sure it is a simple thing that some may not use but being able to charge and hear properly simultaneously keeps the quest 2 ahead in my book >>><<<i wonder if something like resident evil could just be sideloaded>>><<<whats the diffrence in a pico neo and just pico >>><<<being a lighter headset it will be a great addition to my quest2 i am retired so i can use the quest2 in the morning for my holofit and fitrx and in the evening take out the pico and play some bonelab half life alyx mods or minigolf and at the moment half life 2 vr during those games is when i feel the weight of the quest most  looking forwards to get the pico4 >>><<<hi mike do you notice the warp scaling error of the pico 4 which causes your view to slightly warp if you turn your head this has already been an issue on the pico 3 reported serveral times to the developers but has not been resolved yet even with the lastest firmware on the pico 4 the wrong scaling is present on both native and pcvr and should never have been approved by quality control in my opinion some people may not notice this but if you have had other headsets like the rift or quest 2 you immediately should see that there is something off here in some games it is not that apparent but others are just unplayable and feel jittery as hell >>><<<i like brightness and game access quest 2 it is thanks mike>>><<<hi vro i was wondering if you would suggest buying a pico 4 if you are going from a quest 1 with link >>><<<waiting for pico 4 pro a great quest pro alternative>>><<<the audio bluetooth latency will be an issue i had thought that they would remove the compression needed for pcvr by now was not there supposed to be a optional dedicated dongle to connect directly to the pc would not that help in removing the compression requirement otherwise this is a great product i hope they make those improvements in the next iteration if they can use oled display with higher refresh rate then that would be amazing >>><<<was that a g shoch watch >>><<<oh man what a review really well done i still got the oculus rift s i love this device absolutely do but it is getting old now the fov of that thing is just ruining a lot of immersion i might now order the pico 4 soon thanks to this review but i might still wait for the lenovo vr700 not sure yet >>><<<i really do not like this move for headsets using magnetic padding it probably is fine at this level of strength of magnets but it is a fact that we know that magnets can affect the brain in various ways the most dramatic of which is if you put a strong enough one over a specific area it will affect the fusiform face gyrus which will result in you not being able to see faces while its in place again there is probably nothing to worry about in this vr headset use case but i would just prefer other methods of attachment for such things myself>>><<<a ccp tech device is never a great alternative>>><<<if this and the quest 2 are neck and neck not needing a facebook account to use the pico 4 easily gives it the w for me >>><<<woah i am skipping out on this device tiktok is even worse than facebook i will just stick with windows mixed reality it might not be 4k but you are headset is not owned by these people i have nothing nice to say about tiktok it really is a surveillence system do not buy the pico headset get a samsung hmd odyssey windows mixed reality headset it is good enough >>><<<more resolution but worse display less weight but less comfortable mmmmh>>><<<i would defenitily buy a pico but they are not sold in country yet>>><<<it looks like a very good alternative although it seems to be the same experience you would have with a quest 2 even the interface arrangement layout widget and window colors all look the same as the quest 2 i wonder if pico found that meta s software experience is already great and just trying to copied the same in order catch some of that audience anyway great video mike >>><<<you are my favorite vr youtuber it is always very exciting to see you upload new videos and thrilling to see them >>><<<i have received my pico 4 around 2 weeks ago and i have enjoyed it alot i generally play pcvr games and i did not know about virtual desktop thanks for the information >>><<< virtual reality oasis could you provide an update to let us know if prescription lens inserts are available for new devices like this one because i got snap in lenses for quest 2 and i can never go back to wearing glasses under a vr headset>>><<<you can use usb c adaptor that has both 3 5mm jack and usb c passthrough>>><<<pico market is kind of new just compared with the quest store 2 years ago its a much bigger gamestore that quest had and yes everything is better at this headset hardware wise as the quest for me its still a questkiller >>><<<how perfectly you drew your boundary was eerily satisfying >>><<<i guess if you have the original quest this would be a great upgrade >>><<<lol how did you record the dead pixel >>><<<great review thankyou >>><<<are you sure it is a dead pixel you would not be able to record it without capturing through the lense footage imo>>><<<the lack of an audio jack is stupid >>><<<love watching your videos >>><<<the most honest review i have seen yet it is not a quest killer>>><<<great review mike i am glad it ran a little long as it allowed you to give us a thorough sense of what all the aspects of the pico 4 are all about honestly i am looking at the pico neo 3 since i only need a pcvr headset and want something that is a little more robust visually speaking than my rift s so far as i can tell the price is about the same and the g2 may be a bit too much for my pc is specs since i am only running a 3060ti should i make that leap or hold on until the quest 3 finally comes out or should i wait until black friday and go ahead and get the g2 anyway >>><<<is there any screen door effect >>><<<was that half life 7 30 >>><<<meta still has the best software the ui looks more polished and modern >>><<<good review i will wait for the quest 3 and bought a second hand quest 2 for euros260 as new i would rather invest in a ecosystems which is partly developped by and under supervision of goat john garmack than a company which is steered by the chinese government ccp has a huge stake in bytedance which ownes pico >>><<<it is a proper rip off>>><<<if ur thinking of buying a quest 2 for the 1st time buy this as it soo uch better and there is very few negatives where as quest 2 is near the end of its life>>><<<it looks like they copied so much from oculus>>><<<i see it as a hardware vs software issue the pico looks like a generally better headset but meta still has a huge leg up due to its exclusives like beat saber etc if someone found a way to port these exclusives to pico i would buy it in a heartbeat it really just depends on what you value more >>><<<quest 3 in 2023 >>><<<thanks mike i have one coming from amazon tomorrow for my pcvr library which i built up when i owned an index valves lack of wireless support which they promised years ago made me sell my index and i refused to buy into metas ecosystem so this seems perfect for wireless pcvr which i have waited years for thanks>>><<<i wish it was in the us >>><<<pico feels more like copi>>><<<for pc vr players in germany this is a dream there is till this point still no quest 2 available at official resellers when you are mostly playing pc vr and will change a better feeling face padding anyway this is in every single way a better choice not saying it is better than quest 2 overall but definitely a headset more suited for my need >>><<<i have no money for this so i will keep using quest 2 for as long as possible>>><<<hopefully someone can answer this for me if i have virtual desktop on steam will i still need to buy it on the pico store to use with pico 4 >>><<<i feel like in many ways it is two steps forward one step back good design in the strap with properly balanced weight but you can not replace it decent ish audio but no 3 5mm headphone jack pancake lenses and high res display but sluggish os skin comfortable and decently tracked controllers but bulky and heavy and also hard to make grips for due to their strange shape color passthrough but monoscopic and headache inducing i hope software support will improve the headset wherever possible and i hope first party hardware support with accesories will fix some of the issues because right now it is looking good but not as good as i hoped>>><<<can u fix a dead pixel>>><<<hmmm i will have to look into this might be a competitor for the quest>>><<<great coverage it is a quest 2 competitor and that is what we really need right now to make the market both more accessible and interesting >>><<<does this include a modded beat saber after side quest come outs>>><<<getting away from a facebook required account is worth it to me i think it is sad that no one commented on facebook lying about removing the requirement last year at this years facebook connect event >>><<<so a quest 2 minus the meta facebook part that is a win win in my book >>><<< 3 23 clean your lens please>>><<<wow they just ripped the ui right from oculus it looks good we just need some killer games >>><<<what would be your recommendations for someone who has no vr headset at all and is wondering which one to get between the pico 4 and the quest 2 let is say someone who would use both stand alone and pcvr >>><<<play some half life alyx workshop maps they are unlimited and as good as the game it is all i play in vr >>><<<why they do not add a dam micro sd slot is behond me >>><<<the quest has a blurry look to it when i play it just dosent look super clear and sharp when i watch a video feed of someone playing it live is the pico have this same issue >>><<<how much light in the room do you need to use this headset can i play in the dark >>><<<i am not buying this since i ai not trying to support tiktok>>><<< 1 19 can we just appreciate this editing>>><<<nice>>><<<great review thanks>>><<<does it still look like you looking into a binocular in the pico 4 headset cus thats what annoy me the most with quest 2 is that the black stuff around your vision>>><<<was not expecting that full rick sanchez while testing the hand tracking but there you were lol >>><<<a sleek sexy balanced light comfortable beautiful usable design this is the first case where i see a need for an american company to copy from a chinese company >>><<<haha i was literally binging reviews from channels i was not sure about but then this comes out just in time thanks a bunch >>><<<the reason i will never buy a quest product is their data harvesting and abhorrent privacy policy how does this compare >>><<<definitely upgrading from my rift s can not wait to see what wireless pcvr has to offer>>><<<this seems like a genuinely good option >>><<<i will give u leopard for it lol>>><<<pre ordered for more power and better lenses also much better controllers than quest 2 >>><<<shame its not a halo type headset not sure i trust the company either >>><<<mike you deserved a like from me for not calling it a quest killer  i would love to swap this with my quest 2 for virtual desktop with my vrchat full body setup but i am in the us >>><<<i am hoping for the vrcover too i agree that is what it really needs >>><<<where the 4k >>><<<is it a good standalone vr headset as i do not have a gaming pc was waiting for the psvr2 but not sure i want wired vr>>><<<its from china and the personal data given is extreme no its not a great alternative its actually only slightly worst unless of course you do not care about the ethical and moral dilemma of not owning your own digital shadow then yeah go for it sell a little bit more of yourself to them >>><<<thank you for providing such amazing content >>><<<they just stole oculus >>><<<i bought the pico neo 3 link like 3 months ago because i did not know the 4 was coming out do you think that is an l >>><<<amazing vid keep up the great work dude much love  >>><<<got my pico 4 2 days ago but the face cushion is so freaking uncomfortable >>><<<but you would say that since it was free>>><<<i love to see that the vr industry is expanding and some more great headsets are entering the market>>><<<10th>>><<<new mike headset review let is go>>><<<whenever i think of pico i just think of the sauce>>><<<i am gonna get the pico neo 4 on crismas>>><<<thanks for the vid loving the content >>><<<the pico 4 looks so cool>>><<<i always love it when you come out the new video>>><<<first>>><<<hi>>><<<the pico 4 imo is better than the quest 2 because of the weight balance not being more on your forehead and the way the strap and lenses fit on my face and head feels much better than the quest 2>>><<<good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life >>><<<is among us already available to the pico 4 if so how much it cost >>><<<if it was not for the only fact that pico 4 library is way more limited i would surely chose it now i am always in a stalemate between quest 2 quest 3 and pico 4 suggestions >>><<<any suggestions on how to get a new or like new one since i heard they are not available in the us thanks>>><<<i am new to exploring vr gaming so pardon my ignorant questions if it is connected to a pc for pcvr gaming can i still use my pc speakers for the sound output instead of the speakers on the headset or will i be hearing audio output from both the headset and my speakers and also i have heard about having to sign up for an account or something when using those meta vr headsets does this require an account if it does is an account absolutely necessary for pcvr gaming especially for flight and racing sims >>><<<love the pico 4 >>><<<can you use hotspot on iphone 13 to connect too pico 4 looking at getting one but no wifi>>><<<show do not tell will ya >>><<<quest 3 was able to connect to my pc through wifi 6 and it had no lag can this headset do that too >>><<<any devices with removable batteries is a big plus for me i use rechargeable aa and aaa batteries i have a bunch of them fully charged whenever needed you do a quick swap instead of waiting for them to charge and there are no worries of an internal battery that is difficult to replace when it breaks down >>><<<does it have any apps to watch cinema with your own 3d movie files >>><<<i just want a vr headset capable of watching vr movies while not having a fucking facebook account is is good for that >>><<<can i use virtual desktop to play wireless with my pc >>><<<am i missing something or did you not really mention the visuals or compare to anything for reference >>><<<rewatch your video and start counting how many times you touch your glasses and do not include the times you touch them when you actually are mentioning your glasses i will bet you did not realize you are doing it that much in the span of 16 minutes  just watched a video with norm from tested and he has the same tic >>><<<i love my pico 4 i have had it since launch sitting on about 70 games >>><<<would also mention you are still able to connect your bluetooth headphones >>><<<unfortunately the pico 4 is not available in the us still >>><<<will the fiber optic link cable keep this charged while playing >>><<<how do movies and youtube look compared to the q2 >>><<<so i got a totally noob question that i can not seem to find the answer to anywhere online i recently bought a pico 4 and im trying to figure out how to change the profile pic from the default yellow dog to one of my avatars that i created if anyone can answer that for me id greatly appreciate it tia >>><<<can you use a headset plugged into your pc if you plug the pico into the pc to use for vr audio>>><<<waiting for the quest 3 let me see which is better>>><<<it is just my first week into pico 4 i am a quest user but the pico system has so much freedom i can finally use discord without headashes the extra ram makes a lot of difference besides the weaker library of games and apps i really think that the pico 4 is a way best option if you want a vr headset definelly not a master upgrade if you are coming from quest 2 but for sure a best hardware >>><<<can it play pavlov and hot dog horseshoes and handgrenades and blade and sorcery>>><<<do you need a pc to use it>>><<<i tried my friend quest 2 and pico 4 pico 4 lenses look much better and the out of the box strap the balanced weight give superior experience >>><<<i liked the headset for its features but in some ways it is simply the better option because it had the advantage of being a new headset vs a 2 year old headset and vr tech moves pretty quickly the pico 4 is 430 euro and the quest 2 is 300 euro which makes the pico 4 a bit more of a tough sell i also prefer the more fine tuned software of the quest 2 but for pure pcvr the pico 4 is the better one but is it worth the 130 euro extra not sure especially with the quest 3 approaching >>><<<i was not sure about the pico 4 as i already had a meta quest 2 but about a month ago i decided to take the plunge and buy one hey i am so glad i did as it is leaps and bounds better than my quest 2 so much so i ended up selling it the one thing i regret knowing what i know now is that i should of made the switch to pico 4 sooner anyone on the fence and not sure do not be you will not be dissapointed oh your light issue maybe as you say your face shape as i have had no light coming through at all complete darkness you can also get a small adaptor for a headset only cost gbp3 dollar4 ebay>>><<<can i be a pin please >>><<<if i was not already planning on investing in psvr2 then this definitely seems like something i would be interested in>>><<<vr is fantastic one thing i always tell people before they pull the trigger on any vr is to do research on what they want out of their headset and what experiences they want to get out of it i am not sure how the pico marketplace looks but hopefully its comparable to the meta quest store and the application selection is decent thanks for your insight from your time using it >>><<<great video lono keep up the great work>>><<<seems like a pretty legit unit for the price if i did not get motion sickness i would probably pull the trigger on it >>><<<actually did not even think about the space aspect ans how itd benefit being truely wireless but your coverage of this device has been pretty tip top dude>>><<<what a bad unboxing video >>><<<vr is great i have been playing since the original rift horror games are my favorite horror just hits different in vr >>><<<thanks for the full unboxing and showing me everything in the box i am just buying this headset now and wondering what i am going to get you skipped nothing in the entire thing which i like conveniently this was uploaded 2 days ago as well my last headset was the rift s and i still have it but i am going wireless because i just love the idea of its portability and it is just the better headset upgrade also would like to tell you that walking dead saints and sinners is one of the only good horror vr games in my opinion it is got some rough things to get it running perfectly but it is a great game once it works right i am already big into steamvr and pcvr and also recommend you play a modded skyrimvr someday in your life the absolute best vr game i have ever played because well skyrim is my favorite game ever made >>><<<yoooo lono well well well was not yah one of those turned out on vr motion sickness whatever just kidding lol glad you found fun in the vr ecosystem and is super sweet folks are reaching out to yah to check this stuff out xd for some the barrier to get into vr is kinda huge i get it plus some of the experiences available surely are sketchy but when its good is actually awesome hope you like playing around w it for me space themed games are the most fun headsets usually feel like wearing a helmet or breather mask so it gets immersive organically  cheers homie xd>>><<<great video the all in one aspect is great my daughter was listening to the video as i am making dinner she said you should get that lol >>><<<as my source for game play and gaming news i was excited to see you get the pico 4  i am looking forward to seeing the performance of an all in one system as that makes a purchase much more straight forward please keep us up to date on the play tests >>><<<vr is not a niche market anymore it seems like every time you turn around somebody got a vr headset coming out really glad and excited>>><<<looks like a quest 2 just a bit updated >>><<<looking forward to seeing how it
