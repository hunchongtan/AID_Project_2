this is the first affordable pancake headset and according to reviewers it features bigger fov than the quest 2 too bad it is a bytedance product though ,Audio
not true the device is being distributed in europe and so has to comply with our strict regulations additionally this headset does not require any login edit it does need a login listen to be fair requires no social media account would entail no login to most people right am i crazy for thinking that regardless they were one step ahead of me on this one so it turns out pico accounts technically are not social media accounts sick of this bollucks ,Audio
,
chinese companies are famous for obeying regulations ,Audio
that sounds a bit insane 5 secs of head and hand motion to identify person can you please point me to that study ,Audio
woah woah woah chinese paid bot here the chinese government told me to tell you that privacy is number 1 priority that is why we need your personal information it is to keep you safe safe from our enemies like orange man and randy marsh bytedance is simply just a big security network working to keep you safe now have a good day ,Audio
they own tiktok ,Audio
you could have just said tik tok lol,Audio
it is the parent company of tiktok and a chinese tech giant company and like most tech giants has been involved with questionable practices plus it has close ties with the chinese gov afaik ,Audio
maybe one day we will get a decent budget headset from a not awful company probably not though since to release a headset at that price point you kind of have to be a tech giant and as you said most tech giants are at least a bit dodgy,Audio
yeah they are likely releasing this headset with a subsidized price and planning to gain back profits through their sales on their store ,Audio
the lynx looks promising ,Audio
so does america with amazon and do does google ,Audio
the quest 2 is fov really sucks indeed ,Audio
but afaik unlike scummy facebook did in past this company does not require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset ,Audio
do we know if this has the same power xr2 as quest as far as i know it is somewhat heavily underclocked in quest so i am wondering if pico 4 should have the same performance ,Audio
,
i had not played pcvr for a while when bonelab came out and i was really impressed at how good airlink has gotten i upgraded to a wifi 6 router last year and it was already good when the network was not busy but now i can play while my partner is streaming tv in the same room and it works great ,Audio
i find it amusing that people are buying a headset from a chinese company because they are concerned about privacy with the facebook meta headsets ,Audio
well i assume he means that they are one of the most highly scrutinized companies in us now they are being sued up the ass for those mistakes i think bytedance simply cannot have the same checks and balances us gov pretty much flat out said stop using their apps due to access violations ,Audio
 semblance of responsibility that is a good one ,Audio
