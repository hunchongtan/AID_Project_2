i am pretty new to the world of vr what is the issue with bytedance ,Other
it is basically chinese facebook,Other
no no no  its much much worse fb at least has us scrutiny now and is being sued up the ass for past mistakes bytedance has no accountability and privacy policy is meaningless ,Other
,
 here as in gonna be interesting to see how this turns out ,Other
eu is famous for bullying companies which ignore the law and has the biggest expertise on this subject us dgaf ,Other
well we are trying to stop tiktok is eu doing that ,Other
chinese bots be downvoting you ,Other
says the person who is hopelessly pretending that a software update will never come with such a new requirement ,Other
he lied it does require login now ,Other
not really eu does not dictate what goes on with data on servers in other countries just like nobody really dictates that besides the company itself ,Other
companies absolutely build profiles of you without you needing to log in that is why stuff like tracking cookies exist and with that study that demonstrated you only need 5 seconds minutes of head and hand motion data to be able to uniquely identify a person it is pretty scary tbh ,Other
my mistake it is  not 5 seconds but still pretty insane although the possibility for gait biometrics has been known for decades now and the chinese government has reportedly already been implementing it since 2018 i think a lot of earlier technologies kind of oversold their accuracy but they were almost exclusively based on optical analysis having direct motion tracker data not to mention the machine learning explosion that is occurred in recent years makes the stanford study totally believable to me even though their sample size was only 500 ,Other
ah so the pico 4 has no login did not know that that is at least somewhat better not sure if that means no online gaming because that would be a problem ,Other
that little shit is lying he must have no idea what he is talking about ,Other
i should point out that i learned this may be useless as pcvr seems to require virtual desktop which needs to be downloaded with an account so unless you can download with a computer and usb without an account which you really should this may be meaningless apologies for confusion i am equally confused would appreciate if someone could definitively figure out whether pico 4 allows for external apk downloads,Other
the reason for quest 2 not being sold in germany was the facebook login it was changed from oculus to facebook now that its back to meta account it will be sold again soon and of cause you need some sort of account to link purchases and avatar to etc if you do not want to play alone you need to be able to find friends so an account is needed at makes sense only suspicion rises due to the fact that pico is a bytedance company and there maybe a point to it in the end if i buy it i will still surely not be kidnapped robbed hacked or anything else also if i ever visit china they wont greet me by my name and say ahhhh you finaly come over they will be able to see my name birthday address and what games i play for how long and so on should i ever need to go to china likely as i travel a lot for work but so far not china they have everything personal anyways  whats a bit nagging though is that any device with a microphone or camera can give a lot more information if programmed to do so i guess thats what most ppl are concerned about but im not too sure one is better than the other if you are against data collection and want to be safe do not buy any smart things smartphone smartwatch smarthome alexa etc but having a quest 2 alexa smart tv s plus using google without vpn and then fearing the pico doesnt make sense i am not that strong when it comes to resisting new tech so im a data bitch its ok  ,Other
they are releasing their product in the most strict privacy law region on this planet a region where meta facebook can not even sell their devices legally because it already breaks three laws in germany pico on the hand can sell and obligate to eu law that makes it a lot more trustworthy than meta facebook products in regards to privacy and other legal questions ,Other
please do some research on bytedance  you are just making an ass of yourself here claiming they are trustworthy  then come back and make your argument i will wait ,Other
dude just spoke to what they knew about the situation and you were plainly rude as a response get over yourself ,Other
they are already more trustworthy than facebook meta do not worry eu will fuck them up should they try something it is not the us where you can do what you want and just get away with it as a company ,Other
ah ok well that sucks,Other
yea it is either meta sells your data or china sells really any other country i would not care about but china fuck that ,Other
you do not have to be a tech giant to release at a low price point you just have to make collecting and selling user data a priority to cover loses on hardware,Other
or you have to sell enough software to offset the loss on hardware just like nearly every console in history it is not that complicated ,Other
nah at the price point the quest 2 was selling software sales still would not be enough make up for it it was estimated the quest 2 was selling basically at the price of its components so not accounting for labor and logistics costs or the massive amount of r amp d meta has been conducting does not seem to be much different with the pico the vr space has way more potential to creep into everyday parts of your life aside from just gaming and we should all be more weary of letting companies like meta and bytedance take control,Other
lets not be foolish they may also sell data or at least use it to advertise something to you question is if this bothers you or not chances that 3 chineese guys come to your house to build a humancentipad are close to 0 but never say never if you agreed to tos ,Other
 gt the communist party of china uses bytedance products such as tik tok for surveillance and espionage as the united states does with us based social media products as per the eu did not offer adequate protection for eu data when it was shipped overseas because u s surveillance law were too intrusive  ,Other
they will have to obey europes gdpr if they want to sell their product here,Other
just out of curiosity who and how is actually checking if they do so are they required to submit source code for evaluation and what about updates of that code ,Other
yea i got excited about the price then realized bytedance was behind it yea fuck that xi can keep his shit,Other
yeah i cannot express my disappointment when i found that out,Other
if you do not have to log in to any account what is the issue ,Other
you do you have to have a pico account also no login does not mean no data collection like at all any marketer will tell you there is a thousand ways to build a profile on you without an account ,Other
my personal bias friend of mine is a programmer and was doing a job repurposing drones they had decided on a certain manufacturer and got a bunch of parts i was at his place and he was showing me all this junk code that was taking gps pic data and sending it somewhere he was going through and just deleting all of it also the fact that tiktok is known to take image data and compile it as well as north american not just us ban on chinese internet infrastructure and ongoing removal process of any of this existing hardware i am sure at the end of the day there is not much i can do google facebook or prc somebody gonna get that data so it is bias,Other
logging in is not a prerequisite for having your data taken ,Other
yeah between facebook and tiktok headsets i choose neither,Other
i am just over here waiting for index 2,Other
and then we can wait 3 extra years for it to be released in australia,Other
yeah it really sucks that it is made by them it is a good thing the quest 2 is not made by a social media monopoly in progress who will collect every piece of information about you for profit that would be crazy,Other
pick your poison ,Other
too bad quest is a facebook product though ,Other
what is the difference between bytedance having your info or facebook having it ,Other
ones a murderous regime who engages in genocide and oppression of its own people and seeks to dominate as much of the world as it can the other is run by a sociopath lizard man who is helping sow the seeds of the destruction of democracy all in the name of profit and to jam more advertising down your throat choose your posion ,Other
based on your descriptions i do not know which one is which but i live in the us and not china so what can china do to me nothing what can the us do to me everything ,Other
bytedance has no accountability and private information has already been shown to be accessed from china this violates most countries privacy laws but unlike fb being evil in the past bd is evil in past and now look it up ,Other
 fb being evil in the past dude what you say that like it is over with ,Other
well now they are paying the piper both in brand loyalty see stock decline and massive lawsuit losses so being better now is basically about money and survival in this level of scrutiny so if you are suggesting meta is doing any worse than bd now i would like to know what that is honest curiosity ,Other
bytedance willingly gives full access to user data to the communist party of china ,Other
 gt but afaik unlike scummy facebook did in past this company does not require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset to use meta headsets you still need to create a social media account for horizon with followers following etc it is just not the facebook social media but another new one made by the same company for vr you can not have a meta account without a horizon social profile meta are even opening up the horizon app soon to allow smartphone users to join this new social networking app and use it without needing a vr device ,Other
neither did oculus facebook just waited til they got their numbers up then pulled the trigger on data collection it is very likely bytedance will do the same thing considering how much data they get from tiktok it would make sense for them to pull the same thing oculus did ,Other
better performance but it is being consumed by the higher resolution displays which is exactly where i would like it to be used  ,Other
not pre ordering anything i will just wait till people got actual time on it i do not trust the wireless vr,Other
you ever tried a quest 2 with a proper router set up for it wireless vr works just as well as wired for me but is 100percent better imo so freeing not having a wire in the way or pulling on the headset as i move crouch when ceiling mounted plus if i am just going on beat sabre or something that does not need a load of room i can play in my kitchen without having to move all my settee from living room where i play when i need room ,Other
i went back to the index the delay hurts in multiplayer competitive games ,Other
i have played on it yes decent router in the same room still felt a bit of delay in faster songs but it is livable yea but i am mostly just not sure about pico is implementation ,Other
 gt i am mostly just not sure about pico is implementation for dollar10 you do not have to worry about pico is crap software virtual desktop is in the pico store and is bulletproof ,Other
,
 gt i would not be surprised if they had some custom low level software to send data to their servers even without an account the eu has far stricter privacy laws than the us and they are launching there first i would not worry about that ,Other
when you say wired do you mean quest wired or a native wired hmd just for clarification as quest wired is far from ideal as well ,Other
i had a rift originally quest 2 wireless works as well as my rift did wired i have also tried quest 2 wired for a short time when i got a new router from isp and wireless started lagging,Other
ok i would have to say in that case that due to the rifts very aged hardware that your comparison of wireless vr working just as well as wired is not completely true i can definitely believe it works just as well as wired quest i experience the same to the point my link cable is unused for a year however compared to an index or any other native wired hmd of comparable quality there is a significan not visual difference ,Other
not sure which rift you mean but i have both and tested q2 for a couple of weeks over airlink q2 looks a lot worse than rift s and maybe a little better than cv1 the res of course is massively bigger than cv1 but compression is brutal over usb it looks a little bit better than rift s but still was not worth upgrading now people are saying it is massively better with virtual desktop using hevc compression but unfortunately i have not tried that ,Other
yeah that is mainly because of the optimization and coding work done by meta just because it works with airlink and your quest like that does not mean it will on pico ,Other
quite instead of buying a headset where your data is held and sold by a private company that has at least a semblance of a responsibility with it it will be sent to a communist government thats known to spy on its citizens lmao ,Other
semblance of responsibility jesus christ everyone already forgot cambridge analytica ,Other
exactly this when stuff goes wrong both people and the government typically come into play in china the court systems are not fair so you do not need to worry about people and your basically a direct arm of the government when they want you to be if your doing something its in their interest especially if it is something you should not be doing ,Other
the breach of data caused by a third party app not associated with facebook that harvested data participants willingly gave despite it being illegally sold to political campaigns under false pretenses facebook was fined by the ftc for not doing enough to vet the app in the first place however they purportedly shut them down when the breach was discovered there is a lot we can blame facebook for but this one was not primarily on them ,Other
cambridge analytica did not abuse some obscure security bug what they did is what they were technically but not legally allowed to do they violated the terms of service when information was transferred from kogan is thisisyourlife app to ca kogan is app was however allowed to gather all of this data just not transfer it to others according to facebook is chief security officer at the time alex stamos kogan did not break into any systems bypass any technical controls our use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed he did however misuse that data after he gathered it but that does not retroactively make it a breach also not everyone or indeed most of the people willing gave their data to thisisyourlife much less ca their friends gave their data to thisisyourlife and it is unlikely their friends understood the extent of the data being given to thisisyourlife facebook was exceptionally sloppy with user data and actually advertised that sloppiness to other companies it is not like thisisyourlife was the only one hovering up user data like this it was an advertised feature of the platform for crying out loud we can completely blame facebook for companies using features of facebook is platform that facebook openly advertised ,Other
cambridge analytica was not a meta company,Other
did ca actually break any laws i thought part of what made that whole thing horrifying was that it was all legal that is the semblance of responsibility only illegal thing i recall is providing services for free so as to avoid going over campaign spending limits and even that is a grey area immoral for sure but not illegal i could be totally wrong and would happily be corrected on this it is been a while since i thought about this stuff ,Other
nobody said anything about legality it is irresponsible to leak all that data ,Other
that is the thing it was not really leaked it was legally given ,Other
the us government has access to the data of us companies so your comparison is wrong either compare company to company or government to government do not mix apples with oranges ,Other
