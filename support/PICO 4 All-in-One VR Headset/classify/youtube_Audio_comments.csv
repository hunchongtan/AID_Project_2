quest 2 quest 3 quest pro pico 4,Audio
just got one as my first headset really good but the standalone games are actually terrible so i use it with steam if i knew i would only use it with steam i probably would have saved up for a bit longer probably would have gone mad waiting for a headset and gotten a valve index even though it is heavy or a bigscreen when it comes out maybe even a quest 3 since it is lighter but not as balanced ,Audio
do not get why people giving such hate on the built in audio it was 10x better then what all the reviews are saying about it standalone games library is still poor tho 12 months after release and no mod support for games like contractors kinda sucks plus still no pavlov shack ,Audio
,
publisher is bytedance hence i do not recommend this headset research the actions they have committed then decide if you would give money to company like that cheers ,Audio
would this be a good headset if i just wanted to see dirty movies ,Audio
it has now been a year since the release of the pico 4 how does it play now ,Audio
can it vrchat ,Audio
,
he sound like joshdub,Audio
if gorilla tag can be accessed i am happy,Audio
apparently the bluetooth lag was fixed ,Audio
nahhh tic tac,Audio
there is a split audio and charger adapter,Audio
really pico 4 is just trash bro,Audio
how much does virtual desktop cos aud ,Audio
not gonna lie this headset in my opinion is head on against the quest 2 and if improved will 100percent be better ,Audio
i have owned both headsets before and i prefer the pico 4 a lot more than the quest 2 at this point it is just the better choice ,Audio
ps vr 2,Audio
thank you man very positive and informative thank you dear ,Audio
pico from fnf,Audio
terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2,Audio
does anyone notice this looks like the ready player one vr headset,Audio
my nick name is pico  i am so surprised to see this  i am real ,Audio
thanks for the review ten hag ggmu ,Audio
its like meta quest pro,Audio
pico 4 is gt gt gt gt gt gt gt psvr just for that middle finger,Audio
is the pico 4 able to run adobe medium ,Audio
headset like momentum 4 can do around 60 hours of playing music now i know a vr headset would be more power hungry but i bet the battery can be improved to at least 10 15 hours 2 3 is too little in my opinion,Audio
your dog is so cute ,Audio
the pico 4 is a total game changer ,Audio
