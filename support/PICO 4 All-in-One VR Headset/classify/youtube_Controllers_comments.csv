they are locking up these devices to their stores games controllers vr should be open platform so you can buy controllers including specialty gun like for any device you should also be able to play steam vr games regardless of your vr headset if they do not standardize these things vr is not going to be popular at leas nowhere near as popular as regular consoles ,Controllers
what about the quest 3 the quest 3 has full colour past through and no fish eye small controllers so you do not clash them together and the headset is so much smaller so it is so much more portable to take around ,Controllers
so let me do the math here regarding the controllers after a quick google search you can see that a double a battery has a capacity of 1800 to 2700mah at 1 5v let is be realistic and land on a 2400mah battery for a very decent one an economical 18650 lithium ion battery that has a great capacity is the samsung 35e or something 3500mah at 3 6v so 1 5 2400 3 6wh 3 6 3500 12 6wh so say you are a dedicated gamer you play vr games for more than 10 hours per week every week you will have to pay about 4dollar for batteries at the end of the first year will have paid more than 200dollar maybe even 250dollar for batteries d how much is a samsung 35e 3dollar  6dollar for two controllers so why do not they put 18650s in there weight no 2 aa batteries is 46grams 1 18650 is 48grams xd charging controller and type c port literally 1dollar or less manufacturing cost  so why environmental concerns surely after 200 batteries thrown in your trash per year this is not realistic  so  i rest my case they are just stupid they do not get that 4 aa batteries for the two controllers is a considerable expense if they are used frequently ,Controllers
is it compatible with ps5 ,Controllers

advanced beat saber players beware considering the pico4 for playing everything expert on beat saber tldr forget it  long version  if you use the pico streaming assistant either over wifi or over usbc and you crank up the video settings to the max the image quality is still inferior to a valve index because it is blurry lower the settings and it becomes more blurry no matter how it is blurry despite the pancake lenses personally i prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect as on the index than a blurry image without some say the pico streamer app is compressing the video too much who knows whatever the limitation is it sucks  so if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you will need to use virtual desktop virtual desktop consists of 2 parts an app on the pico and a streamer app on your pc but there is a but virtual desktop is streamer app wants to go over wifi only there used to be workarounds involving tethering over usb but after the last firmware update they do not work anymore the workaround involved installing an android app apk which allowed you to access all of the pico is hidden settings besides it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up tons of forums to read on reddit hard to get right on the first try and you had to enable the settings on the pico and on your pc every time before playing uggh if with your previous headset you used to just start vr and play this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker  but now for the major deal breaker the controllers omg these controllers are so bad for playing beat saber it is worse if you have big hands their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and secure grip you end up clicking buttons all the time while playing and you know what that does the plastic is super slippery when playing fast they will slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed do not even think of playing any camellia map when you see youtubers play beat saber with them they all play very slowly clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming the tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play it works but it will ruin your pp  for the rest i found the face mask to be very uncomfortable compared to a valve index but i guess ymmv and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and do not let light in from the sides  i returned my pico4 after less than a week of daily use the poor image quality due to the streaming limitations and the slippery un ergonomic inaccurate controllers made me do so ,Controllers
