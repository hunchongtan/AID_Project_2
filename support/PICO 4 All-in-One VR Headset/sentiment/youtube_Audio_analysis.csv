quest 2 quest 3 quest pro pico 4,LABEL_1
just got one as my first headset really good but the standalone games are actually terrible so i use it with steam if i knew i would only use it with steam i probably would have saved up for a bit longer probably would have gone mad waiting for a headset and gotten a valve index even though it is heavy or a bigscreen when it comes out maybe even a quest 3 since it is lighter but not as balanced ,LABEL_0
do not get why people giving such hate on the built in audio it was 10x better then what all the reviews are saying about it standalone games library is still poor tho 12 months after release and no mod support for games like contractors kinda sucks plus still no pavlov shack ,LABEL_0

not gonna lie this headset in my opinion is head on against the quest 2 and if improved will 100percent be better ,LABEL_1

pico from fnf,LABEL_1
terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2,LABEL_0
does anyone notice this looks like the ready player one vr headset,LABEL_1

is the pico 4 able to run adobe medium ,LABEL_1
headset like momentum 4 can do around 60 hours of playing music now i know a vr headset would be more power hungry but i bet the battery can be improved to at least 10 15 hours 2 3 is too little in my opinion,LABEL_1
