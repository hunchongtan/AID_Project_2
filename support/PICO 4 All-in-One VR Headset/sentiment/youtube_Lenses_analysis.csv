reasons why to not get the pico 4 you can not play gorilla tag on it theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100dollar while pico costs 430dollar and its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can not do anything about it,LABEL_0
