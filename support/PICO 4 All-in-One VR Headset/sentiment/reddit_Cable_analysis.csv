the pico 4 should be the same or even better because it has more ram than the quest 2 8gb compare to 6gb ,LABEL_2
better the quest 2 is underclocked because of insufficient cooling the pico 4 runs the xr2 at full clock rate ,LABEL_1
i found using virtual desktop helped me and you need to make sure if you did not already that the quest 2 is the only device on the 5ghz band make sure there is no traffic management on the router as well and you should be good i would not say it is 100percent perfect all the time but then cable never was either at least with my rift i have never really played quest 2 wired other than quick testing because wireless has always worked so well for me i would be cautious of the pico 4 too though may turn out to be great and i really hope it does as we need more quest 2 competitors especially around the same price range ,LABEL_2
