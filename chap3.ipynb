      "yes    be free when you become a pilot   beautiful livery i love vietnam boeing has sold more than 700 of these bad boys  gorgeous and what wings super i wish i could make a barrel  what is there music  this plane is sick i have travelled from chicago to warsaw and had the best flying experience love the 787 dreamliner  im vietnamese so do not dislike m3 plz it is a beautiful airplane  the boeing dreamliner programme announced in 2003 was supposed to cost dollar6 billion and see the plane take to the air in 2008 the final bill was dollar32 billion and the 787 dreamliner arrived three years late boeing is the past and airbus is the future  wonderful video beautiful aircraft congratulations to the creators there was a mechanical failure while retracting the landing gear i have been on 787 8 amazing experience awesome aircraft nylon eyokbc  lkkk kkkjjjjhhgggffs nn well he is not loaded fake great  it is like fish like dolghine the bravest people the last twenty or so years i have not looked forward to flying any sort of distance recently took a flight from seattle to tokyo on ana 787 dream liner it was a ten hour flight of pure joy the aircraft was absolutely beautiful the clean lines the beautiful interior along with individual tv monitors that pull out from the arm rests i was lucky enough to have an exit seat so i had plenty of leg room the service was excellent with full course meals served at no extra cost oh and the flight attendants japanese ladies were beautiful and very friendly i swear not a one over the age of thirty probably my most enjoyable flight i have ever experienced the 787 is an absolutely gorgeous airplane both inside and out my return trip was on a united 747 that was probably thirty or so years old it was dirty it smelled and i am sure the stewardess were at least forty fifty plus with attitudes the meal was a piece of dried chicken back to reality on why i was not looking forward to the flight to begin with if you get a chance to fly on the dream liner i am sure you will be all smiles at least if it is with japan airlines ana  without music please  payment of sickness bags exceeds revenue  this is a fake  why was it not using the whole run way to take off it was an extreme take off guess you got some extreme seat belts in that sucker  hungarian folk tales take an airbus a380 any day  this is why i live in vietnam and i mostly visit the us again why do they leave the apu running   boeing can my company please use this video for commercial use we will reference  imprint creativity and a touch excellence boeing submitted the best design in modern aircraft engineering congratulations on the video and sound imagen in paris 2015 the boeing 787 900 dream l nea thank you for the sound used in the video of the boeing 787 900 in paris france amazing takeoff and landing that was so cool can someone tell me who the this music is by the music to this is unbelievable  like to see airbus do that best performance ever the 787 is just gorgeous gor geous  that is a beautiful aircraft and always remember blue side up i would love to fly that bird  flying like a peregrine falcon  gentile agile giants of the sky onya boeing  proud of vietnam airlines  0 45 you can literally see the l g hydraulics struggling to pull the gear up lol what a beautiful plane slowly and gently drifting downwind carrying 355 people far away to holiday destinations if i had to travel a massive distance i would definitely choose this plane  what is the music   asaaasaasaa there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god may god bless him and grant him peace that is a stuntplane not a passenger plane ok by video in paris boeing 787 900 vertical and very good thank you emagem 2015 boeing already lands in brazil 787 900 polish lot landed in bel m do par third time that lot company lands at bel m international airport and more good epic awesome really it is unbelievable view with mind blowing background music it made my day thank for the uploaded brilliantly edited  congratulations on the curious boeing 787 900 video vical flight in paris thank you for your attention can not wait to fly on one next year in april pacifically virgin atlantic from london to miami flying like a bird  looks so free  make a vietnam 773 the perfect plane amazing better than a disney roller coaster  somebody tell me the music name plz it looks almost like a metal phoenix i meen the way it flys  v c rip george zip looks like a swift handsome  does anyone know anything about this like were there seats galleys lavs did it only have a thousand kg of fuel im not saying anything bad here i love this aircraft  why do people always fight about who is better between airbus and boeing both aircraft manufacturers are unique in their own way the first thing i see in both channels comment sections is airbus is shit or boeing is shit nowadays both manufacturers have significan notly less accidents because they learn from their mistakes just enjoy the video and both company is amazing aircraft  music  now i know why obama visit vietnam try to be friend again  a350 is gonna reck this ugly thing once the neo comes out this plane sucks what an awesome flying display love it  how come that the vietnam airlines is always first with new models  what a beauty look at the shark fins fantastic  hello i really like this video but i prefer the music that is my boeing  name of this amazing music  what have the wright brothers wrought  i saw an a350 do the same thing at oshkosh 2015 true beauty  gear retraction seems to pulse like hydraulics are being strained would like to see smooth retraction  martlet 3 quite efficiency why do not the 787 pilots to vertical takeoffs in real life amazing what man can accomplish quite impressive indeed  oh that cool zxv zx sv magnificent  cool music hey guys i love airbus the take off alone is simply amazing i love airplanes always have always will since a child i am amazed and fascinated by them  it is like a swallow swallow agile and the wings are ideal but was the aircraft capable of such a maneuver  i actually happened to see it standing still standing and flying are different  the boeing dreamliner programme announced in 2003 was supposed to cost dollar6 billion and see the plane take to the air in 2008 the final bill was dollar32 billion and the 787 dreamliner arrived three years late  these planes have a lot more power than people think climb rates roll and turn rate are restricted in most flight for passenger comfort not aircraft ability anyone who has ever flown into sky harbor phoenix or the old stapleton airport in denver when the wind was blowing from the wrong direction know these plains are capable of a high higher climb rate than you normally see on a commercial flight these plains are made to carry immense weights so taking off empty is like taking the engine our of a 1 ton truck and mounting it on a dune buggy regardless these are incredible aircraft  awesome plane  video perfect perfect music perfect aircraft i am ten this is soooo badass  almost seems like the wings adjust i know they all flex as he maneuvered like they wer stretching back and vertically outfuknstanding wat beauty  this sheet metal is much better than rape 20 i will give it a try  music illumination a p m productions so perfect what is the name of the music  i did not like flying until i saw that bird it seems a great great airplane congratulations  do a barrel roll my favorite youtube video i love the dreamliner  paper fire like it the start is amazing  how much does the license for this video cost i am interested in purchasing it for an educational app best regards g guevara the 787 will break up mid flight it was built by degenerate worker slaves in south carolina controlled by boeing corporate whores in chicago with no care for safety and only profit you have been warned  how does not it stall  i would love to learn how to fly these versatile sophisticated air planes unfortunately the u s government would not permit it as in there eyes i am much too old how about at least giving chance to us 64 year old like myself to prove our selves u s government why not  i mean areally i hear now that you are permitting to bring in 5ft 4 inch 120 pound women to fight hand to hand on the front line right with front line combat special forces units well then  i thought that you were against age discrimination u s government  yeah right  this was uploaded on my birthday  amazing aircraft  i did not know planes could take off like that i have seen fighter jets fail from attempting that  grace personified  h i love this film notice when the airplane lands it is almost exactly on the middle line using the wings the ends of the wings tip up like the feathers on a bird much admiration for the designers and the pilots who fly this plane  look great proud to be watching fantastic  boeing engineers be like well we may have missed the flight envelope classes  fly it like its stolen that was cool is there any vids of this inside the plane  what name music  i like that plane and that airlines boeing 787 vn air fly is very cool fast and softly i love it it is beautiful like an albatross love it   takeoff angle of 0 40 lol already seen 100 times still to go  daaayyyuuummm that takeoff was amazing almost a vertical climb at first  nothing shows the beauty of physics and an aircraft designed to respect those laws than this video the boeing 787 is truly remarkable i cannot get enough of watching it lifting off what beauty  the song is illumination apm production are you sure you didnt hire prison labours in windowless rooms for 23 hours a day and paid 93 cents a day  v1 liftoff vertical climb gear up  i was on one of these from australia to new zealand i have to say what a pleasure it was wait vietnam airlines ok this might be a stupid question but the near vertical takeoff that is only for the air show right that is not how it will takeoff everytime right  i also thought it was gonna stall at the take off xd 1 this is awesome 2 it is a bird xd 3 am i the only one who thinks this song is catchy  i don t bored watching this video i really impresses takeoff wow i also like the background music what is the name of this melody of this vid  imagine being that pilot though being able to push that aircraft to its limits and just soar around wherever you want most pilots who fly this plane will only ever take it in a straight line  i doubt that it can take off like this when it is with full capacity  yep thats a rollercoaster without a track whch one can it be  my country is airline  what music is that it is great  i just watched the al jazeera documentary what do you all think of it  just flew on this beautiful machine to india take a look at the video i shot   h very nice air show it is a perfect music  can you tell me which music is this  it is amazing  go boeing your the bast aircraft maker known to society now that is a climb all most vertical  this airplane is fantastic  wow 787 are cool technology wow let is see what airbus preform with the a350xwb let is see if it can do vertical take off  can we not make vertical takeoffs a regular thing in commercial aviation though thx  that is impressive now try those moves at the redbull competition  its alive  i wanna fly this plane real bad  wow that nearly vertical takeoff boeing or i am not going  i am from vietnam what the pilots keep hearing bank angle bank angle pull up pull up too low terrain too low terrain  nice plane but what the name of the song  where can one get the music from  i love it the music is sublime the plane s awesome a truly beautiful aircraft in stunning livery and this video and soundtrack getting to see the boeing dreamliner 787 9 in flight like this is breath taking boeing you are leading the world into the future of aviation an absolutely fantastic video and i love watching all the developments of the dreamliner family and all of the boeing aircraft models lt 3 i save this video its stunning the wayssit takes off great video guys uau video perfect flight a for the 2015 go amazing takeoff  can they do that almost vertical take off with passengers and cargo on board  looks like they went to moses lake to do training  where is the music from  rt8 amazing pretty awesome way to go boeing you are the pace setter  long live boeing amazing greetings from serbia  this soundtrack is dope tho i love vietnam saw this aircraft two days ago truly beautiful remarkable aircraft now pilots can take action from threats whoa did that thing just go full vertical on takeoff  if the dreamliner is able to fly this well at this low altitude i think this is possibly the best plane ever imagine how well it would cope in an actual emergency i need to fly on the boeing dreamliner 787 before i die  beautiful  what an amazing take off d d very nice i like it  wow vietnam airlines is byoetifol i want my own one  she will be ground breaking another boeing masterpiece 40000ft on full fuel matrix and fibres clearly working wonders nicely shot the wing are awesome wow really impressive and a big thumbs up for the 3 pilots and one for wolfe air aviation footage this plane is impressive and the video is well done  wow  just amazing i will send it to my brother he will probably fall off his chair ssssuuuuuuper   what is this some kind of alien technology that thing fly like a bird what next stop in the air and wait for a red light that is cool for a test drive but i would not do that with 200 people aboard the weight could shift  boeing next year add rocket assist see how steep you can make it take off next year  thats one huge nimble bird i love how the wings looks like a hawks that must be why it has great flying capabilities i was thinking about an plain in which when passenger goes in door would take all what comes inside security to search an body coming inside an aircraft by different kind of metal materials sensors and send an information feedback to cockpit or at an necessary screen and inside an box which is saving all similar security data of whole aircraft if one is having something which he wont have permitted to carry when he she sits on his her chair chair start giving voice response that you have something may with name of material or without go and throw put it out from the aircraft if someone by anyhow came inside with an stuff restricted hidden inside an material which would not came under tracing of crafts security features when person opens it or goes toward washrooms and other facilities tracing sensors if trace that thing would instantly make an alert toward respective staff responsible for taking action against that circumstances if one enters inside washroom with anything unconditional for flight while flying door will shut automatically with an full proof alert to staff and can only be opened after landing of aircraft and if one is carrying an arm and ammunition if he fire from inside nothing would got harmed mean to say no effect of bullet if fired inside such place its like we have created an spider like hidden security web inside plane which would never got defeated if executed by proper experiments and practical experiences this formula is defeating every kind of step taken for aircraft is security against terrorism illegal movements and illicit trades done by planes i would like to have an must reply from boeing family as i love working with innovations which will help growing more futuristic ideology about technology and engineering with engines reality is i have never seen an plane from an short distance in my life never visited an airport nor gone inside an plane and never seen how an plane looks from inside how it feels when you were in an plane  sheer beauty poem in motion  airliners can pull of vertical wow much love and dollar09 i would like to see from the side profile it looks like 90 degrees pitch from high above but i doubt it will really be that much a side profile will not be as impressive maybe 45 degrees  must be tough pushing that trolly up hill dinkoeh boeing i wrote yes sent through the post to you a few years ago with an excellent yet simple i concede idea for the safety of your aircraft and you did not even have the common courtesy to write back  flying like a bird  what music is this please  binliner  on 0 51 you can clearly see the connections between composite sections of the fuselage these connections have been big problem for assembly they placed aluminum inserts inside carbon fiber so you need to drill abrasive carbon first before you get to aluminum you can do it on a few holes but not on thousands sections do not also fit well together another big problem is mechanical system which is made out of steel all the actuator for cargo doors landing gears high lift system horizontal stabilizer trim actuator and pilot controls all made out of metal not composite while these composite components are available from for example frpgear company in the usa and from some in eu only the exterior the shell is composite while the most of the airplane is not it is just like our country looks good from the outside while not so good inside  beautiful bird  amazing flight it is not the same flight inside my experience showed me that it is the worst way to fly the seats of the economy class were permformed for childrens under ten years not for adults i have fly on the route buenos aires to dallas just a forgettable fly you are mot able to move any centimeter just suffer the fly excelent outside take care of the inside fly it is the worst experience of my life good video and sound a beautiful and interesting plane  like for pilot what is the music used in this video  gta cool but what a waist of taxpayers money and airplane 757 300 anyone  must have been some experience for the drunk guy who was still asleep in the back from the last flight  unbelievable amazing feat by the pilot the music is just a perfect match with this video as well  wow vietnam airlines livery is really beautiful  i do not want to fly anymore beautiful aircraft  is this gta kkkkkk i love this aircraft  i would say do a barrel roll but you would loose too much lift  i have been in one of the flight with this babe and it is amazingly pleasant powerful and elegant inside out i can not take my eyes off while waiting for boarding such a magnificent piece of machine well done lt 3 i think its the most beautiful plane on the world  appear to happily without carefree in exhilarating  i love vietnam                                                 imagine the reactions of the people that didnt know this was a test flight lol omg the graphics are amazing what game is it and when does it gets released can not wait  characteristic of the boeing 787 9 length        62 8 m height          17 m span        60 1

the thrill airbus could do the same with its a350 xwb it would give it a big publicity boost  nice curves like the curves of a beautiful woman  boeing prepares boeing 787 and linea castel nice but i think that is a camera effect  awesome ditto wow  nice aircraft d spectacular    simply magnificent the music was chosen perfectly a majestic plane the most beautiful boeing ill be on one in december i can not wait b707 out of stock b717 out of stock b727 out of stock b737 in stock b747 in stock b757 b767 in stock b777 in stock b787 in stock i knew they would barely be able to get it off the ground  every time science amazes human beings  what the hell i want to fly one like that  best looking plane in the air  a seductive elegance  0 39 i almost fell out of my chair do some more stuf incredible footage and flying why the hell is this vertical takeoff is it such a joke in asia i have flown in both china and vietnam and the pilots always raise the plane almost vertically after taking off from the ground so that life does not seem like honey to passengers  so with this one you can make a 911 official hoax pentagon turns hat off for the pilot acts like he is flying combat jet amazing not me the takeoff is convincing too fast  wo  damn what takeoff is this  anyone know what this song is called how in the world was that first shot done looked just like the lane was coming right at the camera after that amazing vericle takeoff    that is beautifull machine respect to all people and engineers who made it awesome  i have never seen a commercial airliner do that before  just awesome stunning plane  portugal text late i feel relaxed  handsome man    very nice it flies like a bird boeing made great airplane greeting from russia  the dreamliner is one of the strongest in the boring fleet  beautiful aircraft really enjoyed the video thanks  she looks extremely nimble and really cute yet simple i want one of those  lol all the airbus fans butthurt and disliking this video haha cool give me boeing 797 now i can not wait anymore vietnam airlines flying the beautiful dreamliner this is the world getting better  amazing but how do i download this clip  i am loving it  a380 is way better  probably stripped to barebones it raised its head too scared to go  wow i worked in the canadian airforce on the boeing 707 for 15yrs and loved the aircraft old but very reliable now seeing the 787 9 is awesome  probably out in moses lake wa where boeing trains a lot of pilots and tests their new aircraft  the landing looks so gentle incredible aircraft spectacular pilot skills   i linked the video from the show with these scenes in it to my facebook page needless to say people were thrilled with a few declaring the rocket vertical takeoff was trick photography since i voted for the name dreamliner and lobbied all my friends to do likewise it is my aircraft great job with this beautiful aircraft and it is incredible wings  did that plane just went nose up without stalling and crash hi all i am working vietnam airlines  1500 dislikes by airbus fanboys this is so beautiful to watch what a nice plane and such great pilots i would love to experience a takeoff like that  why do not you make your wings with surface like a golf ball would be less drag and more surface area  must have seen this about hundred times and still can not get enough the music is absolutely perfect  i was waiting for a barrel roll p  omg i love this plane it s so comfortable  d what is music  vietnam my hometown  lt 3 wait wait wait hold up did that plane just fly straight up  incredible for a commercial aircraft  very nice footage i think was watching the scenery more than the plane i live in moses lake wa where this airport is located those hangars you see in the footage are now genie industries where they make aerial platforms and cranes the reason boeing used moses lake for their test flights is that we have one of the longest runways it used to be an emergency landing strip for the space shuttle and because of low population density as you can see it is mostly farmland and sagebrush out here oh yeah the test flight was pretty cool too shows what this aircraft is capable of i doubt they could do this fully loaded though  such a beautiful plane wish i had been in mosses lake wa when they were doing this i am amazed it looks like hovering climbing a very steep angle amazing performance  i just flew from honolulu to sydney on one of these and it was a pleasurable experience very smooth and quiet aircraft  does anyone know the represent symbol of vietnam airlines all discovery from nature great thanks to god what a beautiful bird i almost worked at the musee du l air at le bourget outside paris bannelieu i was researching alberto santos dumont my hero one of the greatest pioneers in aviation history his aircraft are housed in their collection i am an artist painter i am thrilled by innovation bravo boeing the use of composites and especially copying natural design of bird flight i was writing a movie on dumont his demoiselle was that flown by the frenchman in the fantastic movie those magnificent men in their flying machines george milo buck sex on wings really it is wonderful marvels human brain incomparable thing thanks for god how did you shoot the takeoff sequence at the beginning  hey boeing we want to hear those engines etc as she flies by  do you have a vers w o the music great plane btw you probably do not want to be sitting on the airplane lavatory at 38   why is this plane so much more maneuverable than the jumbo jet from gta  very nimble for a passenger plane  why is there over 1 000 dislikes fake  next to the 747 and the upcoming 777x the 787 9 is just as beautiful in flight  thats how an emptyone flys boeing the best company to work for great executives hospitable work atmosphere for all peoples diversity at its fullest and at its best trust me  technolgy is amazing these days what engines did vietnam airlines choose for its 787 fleet  whats the bgm  nice plane so amazing just like a bird  most people do not realize how mighty a modern jet airliner like the 787 9 really is the power of the modern turbofan engine combined with a lightweight composite structure make it possible for unimaginable maneuvers these planes are flown in a much different manner when transporting passengers and freight the normal everyday flight goal is a smooth and seamless operation with minimal flight correction the 787 9 could do a barrel roll if you wanted it to but for the safety of the crew and the people on the ground it is prohibited this is a wonderful technology we take for granted in modern western society  great dreaming airbas never going on that plane hope they stick with the 777 people you all 1321 why are you do not like it it is not a figter plane but makes some   magic   that wingspan is just beautiful  beautiful what a work of art amazing  damn those engines wow  vietnam is finally getting some recognition d in short at 0 35 min high quality professional installation take a closer look in real life this is impossible for such aircraft if you look closely there is a smooth takeoff transition then a landing element and takeoff again only the su 35 and others of this type can do this  awesome thank you boeing  wow a near vertical take off  awesome i love boeings  amazing  my god its wonderful  am i the only one that would have paid good money to be in that plane lol wish we could see a similar takeoff from a 747 that wouldve been awesome advantages of flying beautiful flying i like it  amazing  amazing machine so gorgious wow  boeing did you build a commercial airplane or a fighter bomber really beautiful plane  this is airplain recently deliveried for vn airlines  great experience 1k dislikes from airbus this music is so chill i demand the name at once and no darude sandstorm please  i bet the after airbus saw the video the to back to the drawing board and try to make the a380 go up vertically my thoughts are is this the standard or the souped up version  very manoeuvrable  shooting with a long focus works wonders  why do you have gameplay of me flying in gta 5  if you could change it would have been safer for the pilots of 787 love boeing chefs it the 787 is a very nice airplane but for the pilot front is like a trap in other aircraft can open the windows in cockpitt and save to a circuit in the case of smoke in the cabin out dasurch are the front 4 large windows can not go out to the pilots it is important that it could cost here durschlesen there live from pilots  those wings  they are so freakin gorgeous  if i had the money boeing i would buy one just because of how fantastic this video is  very nice the most beautiful bird flying and reigning the sky of the world awesome great performans boing  that vertical takeoff was amazing d perfect  wow so smooth and graceful the good fact is you will never see a comercial airliner do this with passangers onboard another very good fact is that if in trouble this machine has power enough to fly only depending on the engines not the wings the extra power of the engines will save lives well done boeing  wonder what it feels like 4 the passenger look at the angle of take off simply impressive  vietnam airlines logo set against the clouds as the plane flies through the air is breathtaking   my eyes were watering  boeing is maybe a good company but they did not respect all people who came to the public days at paris air show by leaving it before  best aircraft video ever seen  congrats   who needs a commercial airliner take off vertically  the b 787 9 is better than its rival a350  did the philippine airlines have a 787 9  it uses the ge90 or the ge nx if and is is carbon fiber as well so it can take off vertically without stalling the 787 9 cannot takeoff vertically using the rolls royce trent 895  cesarnect which song is that  new machine in airspace wonder thank you so beautiful can not wait to travel long haul on this beauty with virgin  imagine all the alarms going off on this flight  i love the music what is my favorite part is at when the music goes dododo  any one know the sound track title please  welcome to viet nam it is nice to know that next time i am on a flight with someone who is scared about engine failure i can tell them the plane would still be able to take off and land safely with only one  press 1 2 3 on ur keyboard not my preferred method of take off as a passenger  wow the takeoff is really vertical hmmm can it still takeoff like that with a plane full of people  vietnam airline lt 3 it is a perfect i speak little english i am from brazil  it is a beautiful piece of flying artwork  why this is a big deal what is up with this plane  how was that shot of the vertical take off done did they use a helicopter or drone  boeing knows how to make a bird  the music for this video is awesome  insane takeoff it looks like this video is fake you can not do this with a adanare plane you a need a military jet to do this kind of maneuvering fake video i think that is really cool  wow i can not understand if this is in slow motion or if the plane is actually flying so slowly o hay toi rat thich we have 1 181 haters this morning   7 seconds to take off almost a swallow when i saw the plane take off i was like okay okay wut that is vertical the flight theory equations will have to be redone after that incredible  ok g it was a steep slope even after taking it off  i get this thing flies amazing but how many times have you been in a commercial passenger plane that has needed to do a 60 degree take off or do a 45 degree pitch in a turn  airbus gt boeing how in the name of reason did they get that take off shot  great perspective great show  very impressive flight envelope i am baffled by the camera angles though what kind of camera plane are we watching from  nice aircraft well boeing let me ask you a question where is the 777 200er of mh370  pretty beautifully shot but no cobra there is no pugachev on takeoff here as someone mentioned it is just the shooting angle chosen nothing more  please cool i wonder if he can land just as cool as he took off  they should try to push the limits even more next year at farnborough by adding a decent amount of cargo and fuel see how some real life applications effect the performance i know this is really unlikely but just imagine having the same kind of performance with real world effects and also imagine the 787 with the ge90 engines  beautiful footage although i must say this is not even 40 degrees of pitch it stays around 35 and 37 degrees not even half of a right angle  hey boeing what is this music  vietnam vietnam buying an american made boeing really so fast changing world i won t be astonished to find it in the cuban airways one day  music i want to know music  could it take off like that with a full load of passengers and cargo i do not think so warning stall warning  hope they put a new battery in   for someone who has never flown and knows little to nothing about planes this looks like just another plane  damn that is a pretty airplane those wings   hazel hen always interesting to find where my son is music has been placed  hello my youtube channel suvo videos about various games if you like could subscribe to my channel and like him i would greatly subscribing thanks  how would you like to fly that big bird and fly it like that wow  but i like it a little it is orible  we go vertical bitch d  welcome to the grand theft airplanes gta  good already replayed over 5 times can not stop my heavens what whose is that mesmerizing music somebody please hint in  btw great feat boeing now go concentrate on designing emergency systems to prevent not coming down equally fast with or without the pilot is hands on such things pun intended   this pilot is one lucky sob  just find out he does not have any strength or you will have to deal with me boeing we are happy for you  because boeing is empty with full load no verticaliy rise i think but it great and awesome  spectacular takeoff  dream moments  the dreamliner flies like a fighter  wow vietnam airlines wow god damn that 787 9 is beautiful  there  here is just something beautiful about boeings the guy drives this oklm like it was a game lol xd airshows are often about show off bragging and the exhibition of the best you got surely the boeing dreamliner i loooove this plane did all of those demonstrating a near vertical climbout after takeoff is definitely showing the planes magnificent performance  when it is not carrying max take off weight i adored the video  loved it wow better than viagra  awesome this video ist very impressive similar maneuvers has been performed with smaller planes before but this is just awesome  do a barrel roll just like the 707 going up at that steep angle can not be exactly 100 percent safe a spectacular stunt whether vertical maneuverability is due to pilot skill and expertise or the technical design of the boeing nevertheless it reflects the aircraft capability to spin around like a combative fighter jet watch the cockpit video and you will see that it it is not a trick by camera angle as one person states below it is vertical becsuse of the amount of thrust and a very light plane probably less than half fuel load also vomit everywhere prepares its a plane it flies not to much to prepare really  excellent the 787 is a bird i loved this video nice  what a beautiful bird hope one day to fly on a 787 9 does anyone know this bgm  awsome amazing take off  i am just thinking if is possible when is heavy  very nice music thx this is a beautiful fuselage is not it  can not wait to see 787 10  what for music plays here  wow that take off dd song name do not joking or i will flag you edit i need the three views one  nightmareliner the biggest financial disaster in the history of commercial aviation almost 300 planes delivered at loss already  that plane looks so graceful when it is flying compared to most jets that size i mean most jets like that look like they are lumbering to stay aloft  lindo  how much did vietnam airlines paid for it  really amazing flight  wow great video and aircraft looks awesome head on  i can do better it is good to know the plane can do thing like that but i hope they never have to or a lot of passengers are going to need a change of under ware  if it aint boeing it aint going  9th fighter company in my hangar youtube demonstrated new video editing capabilities using the example of the boeing dreamliner post 252208   for anyone who wants to repeatly listen the music vietnam airlines  wow so impressive i never thougt that one of these could do that fg great congrats team  i can guarantee you bunch of drones were used to capture all the footage lt 3 beautiful car  i was vietnam and so is wondering why vietnam airline is plane back to dc choose instead demonstration aircraft of boeing brand paint well you can see it from a normal angle not from directly above but from diagonally behind it  and it crashes  awesome banks like a boss  awesome he looks like mothra and flies well  grew up in palmdale calif area saw the l1011 do some stunts that were just as nice loved watching the touch and goes trust me guys this stuff is real and america is the best airplane builder in the world they used to close seriha highway between palmdale and lancaster to let the sr71 clear the road was such a rush to see that sucker go and in 15 seconds she was gone where does it say the plane is stripped of seating no pax or baggage and low fuel will mean this thing takes off like an f 16 heck even in small aircraft if you fly in ground effect along the runway building up speed quickly you can climb out rather steep  does anybody know what is the music track of this video  beautiful flight beautiful plane demonstrating the power it has congratulations boeing you are the best wow i just love that wing flex d why are people so surprised the 787 is half carbon fiber light plane giant thrusters amazing maneuvers  they shot it to look even more impressive than it actually is which is a shame because it detracts from the reality of it this next years 911 stunt should be very intresting if it ai not boeing i ai not goin  who is the pilot awesome sky jump i want to fly with him  well done boeing putting worldwide buzz on this incredible aircraft i am sure sales for vietnam airlines will get a boost too fantastic display of aeronautics looking forward to filming paine field once again greetings from canada music title a p m productions illumination enjoy  amazing footage beautiful plane wonder if there was any footage from inside the cockpit  glad my son works for the right company  vietnam boeing is awesome they manufacture the most advanced products in the world retired in 2006 after 28 years with the helicopter division i am proud that i was part of this great company  wonder who is giving thumbs down airbus loyalists because they do not have a carbon fiber airplane yet that can do this never have seen a plane built for commercial air travel act like a little like a military aircraft we all know under full load conditions a 787 could never do this but doing it empty is still an impressive engineering feat  wow vietnam no 1 welcome grand theft boeing is vietnam airlines amazing best plane ever  whoa vietnam airlines boeing godzilla  that is a rocket and a plane evidence we live in the future  what song is this cool airplane  looks like it handles nice meh i am not that impressed a truly skilled pilot leaves the cock pit and walks out onto the wing  must have been screaming loud when doing that vertical take off boring i have always kiled observing the advances in aero technologies but i am on the ground filming streets  this is the pride of our vietnam   0 42 what sorcery is this lol  all the haters saying that boeing is a crap company obviously does not know much at all you do not get to be a multibillion dollar company by being terrible you have to do things the right way and do it the right way a few times over or you will never ever build the clients that you desperately need to get that large  love beautiful  beautiful  can not wait to see garuda indonesia livery on this beauty  yasss  name of music  brazilian airways cool i love this video and the boeing 787 9 it is a beautiful aircraft   ppc passenger  the engines are so huge i wonder what their bypass ratio is  do not need to talk about the fight i had just cement on if i should be on 7 awesome kids  yawn  where is tex johnston machoverspeed i just woke up what a beautiful plane a great way to start the day  what an awesome aeroplane what an awesome piece of flying  song please    it is a boeing the best in the world i do not think the f 35 can do this lol  awww com on do a full barrel roll already you know you want to this is of course a refferrance to the film of the test flight of the dash 80 early 707 in which the test pilot takes it inverted hey did you guys know there is a new tech that can allow these to exhaust pure water with even better performance if you do not you are not the ones who stole the plans from my home in minnesota before i was well you know silence with extrme prejudice for being too smart and did you have to put vietnam airlines on it presidents kennedy johnson nixon and even reagan are spinning in their graves faster than those geared fan jets you pratts i know they were not really anti communists they just needed a scapegoat to cover up their shall we say man boy love beside there is money to be made so they will work with anyone except that one brilliant boy inventor who would not bend over by the by the new tech is called hope and see videos of stan meyer driving a car on tap water before his untimely demise the day he sold it to the us military same day really argh gag barf i have been poisoned by the cranberry juice at the craker barrel  worst job pitch ever call me the new scape goat now with hope  suddenly a comment in spanish appears hahahaha while in reality going up o sht stafing o sht ttttttt hey friends there is a gta 5 version of this videos search it and watch it is also amazing  rtgr vietnam airlines lt 3 1 000 people from airbus disliked this video shame on them   floats like a bird stings like a snake  looks awesome from this clip it seems like it has great trust to weight ratio almost jet fighter like good job boing but what airbus plane is dreamliners main competitor  one can only imagine what their new bombers and transport planes are capable of if the passenger plane can take off vertically  hello i can do burnouts and drift into corners in my taxi its pretty impressive anyone want to jump in and go for a ride  vietnam lt 3 cool i want to fly on this one  remarkable amazing beautiful outstanding  impressive but you will never fly like that due to safety regulations that takeoff gt gt gt  holy crap pretty impressive  jevons paradox continues  i thought he was going to make a loop right now  do not comment   music a p m productions illumination it is so rare to see a shot of an aircraft from those perspectives whoever is responsible for this film is a genius gave me goose bumps all over and you guys at boeing keep on bending those wings  one of these engines produces more thrust than a pratt and whitney f22 engine in fact more than twice as much minimum people do not really know this  get back my 3 minutes of life if this plane could make a vertical take off we would not be shown a montage with correctly selected shooting angles but a video from a camera on which the horizon is visible the gdp is visible and the angle of climb is clearly visible otherwise of course a spectacular clip  damn after such tricks they will be tired of cleaning the interior from vomit in short good but better not  take off is not realizable dangerous but amazing  classy is the world breathtaking once again you folks use a great music score and love the nod at the 00 01 36 mark to the new frontiers ads by using at least i think so piece from to the top so it is time you put out a cd with all the great music from all your ads  incredible video this shows the power of this beautiful aircraft  the hunan capacity for overcoming and innovating is absolutely incredible but once boeng comes to show its superiority music name  awesome wow  was this shot with a drone  i would never sit there for sure cool wings  awesome takeoff  love the takeoff footage what was the angle of attack on rotation great flying and beautiful aircraft nicely done boeing  how maneuverable it looks this is scary and wow that is one beautiful aircraft  oh my god this is insane but epic at the same time how is this possible for a 787 9 to do this as doge would say so insane so fly  welcome to the real world     no matter what it is always boeing to impress me and i am glad  song  simply perfectly love this airplane  oh my god lol  amazing congratulation vietnam airlines and boeing  next time you go on holiday ask the pilot if he can do one of these take off is it is very proud to be on vietnamairlines with dreamliner 787 one day thanks for beautifull video clip  one question purpose  rubbish ummm wow  where was the barrel roll boeing  amazing where are its routes destinations at this moment if any  boeing is most beautiful airplane and video so far unbelievable congrats boeing  think of all the war it took to get your product to this point horrible company  this is fake the plane takes off at about 70 or 80 degrees and due to trick photography and different camera angles it seems like the plane takes off 90 degrees vertically  passengers do not want such a sharp take offf   all the passengers are now in the back of the plane oh by the way how many gravol pills do we have to take before take off and landing are the flight attendants distributing the pills along the salty peanuts  as a passenger i am not at all excited about this perpendicular take off i am not going to the moon  i am just going to paris  876 dislikes by flyemirates xd  near vertical take off interesting how about near near vertical landing too  i would love to see them doing this on a380 this is impressive but it would be nice to see the side view of this takeoff to see how close to vertical the 787 actually does or does not come the viewing angles chosen to film feel like cheating to a degree  what we see here is how tampongs feel every time they are needed  chawo beka gwadagnoche you have seen a new wedet endehona gin alakim hah bagimit gin paris ayidelem wow epic is this version the 9 or 10  uuulla what a beautiful looking aircraft wow  fantastic air ship  would love to fly on this wonderful smooth and elegant machine it soars and appears to respond to the pilots touch easily wonderful   my hope usa vietnam friends again sweden humans are awesome beautiful bird does somebody know the angle of the plane and the runway during the take off  there are no words martin   l oj  love this  wow the near verticle take off is incredible this is a really magnificent machine from boeing fabulous  wonder what the 3rd guy is doing  great maneuvers     for an empty plane  please tell me name of music on this video d such an elegantly graceful aircraft the thumbs down posters no doubt own stock in the airbus faction  ratheedhravi it is great everything that plane can do  fly vietnam airlines  this body is made and is ordinary bowing e 3a is made this much too it is not a rare thing  amazing  787 9 jet fighter xd the shape of the wings remind me of masamune shirow is gits futuristic jetliners  what beautiful wings  that is a beautiful aircraft i miss the touch and go display but i guess it is not safe anyway  i didnt think a plane could do that and how did they film that with a selfie stick  can anyone give me a hint  imagine how awesome it would be being inside that bird just wow  no barrel roll i am kinda disappointed lol on a more serious note the take off looked sick how did they film that with a drone or a helicopter looked like he was going up a 90 angle o o when does it crash  plane and background filmed separately and alot of computer animation stunning so cool if the astronauts as human beings can do insane training this should be piece of cake 3 goosebumps vietnamese   let the orders by the hundreds begin  so proud of boeing and their dreamliner program i have followed it since day one  i fell in love   what is the background music  90 degree landing would be great  with this video boeing sales increase they made 2 jets for the joint strike fighter competition it looks like they took so of the innovations they made and carried them in the big airliners superman filmed the video wow thrust away yes do not have coffee when that baby is in climb mode but then what was the load factor in any case it ops lke a lil cesna almost i will take one or does bo get first dib  nice wow that is impressive  boeing is biggest n best usa usa usa  magnificent performance  o o the plane is this agile i really need to get my head out of 1987  this is now  i want to see that in my next copy of plane simulator 2016   it looked like a videogame in some parts of the video big bird takes flight how risky is it possible to do it with a full charge  does anyone know whether this capability is unusual or can other airliners do the same thing i am assuming they can not even if they are stripped down i am assuming this is highly exceptional but i am no expert on aircraft nb i am not asking if airline companies normally fly their planes this way i know that they do not i am asking if other planes that are used as airliners have this same capability  i know theres millions of people who want to see the summer hit spy reviewers are hooting and hollering about it being exciting you do not have to go to the movies to see this just watch it online the movie has received critical acclaim from multiple sources very good video  i really do not understand the hype  a normal heavy passenger jet runway is usually 10 000 to 12 000 feet the 787 seen here is airborne by the last fixed distance marker a mere 2000 feet of runway measured from the touchdown marker where the plane is seen still taxiing and just starting to apply power  2000 feet and only about 10 to 12 seconds from power on amazing just for some reference point numbers to help visualize this amazing feat  any chilean xdddd looks like this plane can do vertical loop like fighter crafts what name music  that takeoff o i wonder how much that little stunt cost plus those planes are not cheap impressive performance though  and what are the passengers doing vertically this is way too violent of a takeoff for most clients in my opinion  i want to see an airbus doing that  superb air plane hello is name jonata very impressive takeoff i do not mean to take away from this amazing takeoff but i see people comparing this to the a350 saying no way it can do it but guys can not any plane do this i mean all you have to do is go much faster than usual while still on the runway and then yank back on the stick till vertical then level out before you stall  can it is fuel melt steel beams  boeing vs airbus boeing wins thanks so much   terrible but the boeing 707 was better  i wonder if saab has done anything in this plane they corporate with boeing  most nauseating takeoff ever  anyone know the name of the song  glider flying very elegant japanese technology is also stuffed full thank you for boeing back music good  trying to fix the reputation of a plane known for having some serious issues  insanely amazing fabulous spectacular flying machine congratulations  amazing the most beautiful boeing i ever see and great song airshow paris bourget 2015 7 809 041 people have seen this video wtf  who plays this song  looks like tiny toy flying through air lol p it can still fall ha ha ha  the boeing 787 9  first stol short takeoff and landing commercial aircraft   what a treat to see a commercial airliner perform in such a manor fantastic  moses lake  what about synchronous acrobatic flight  that plane looks sexy  and how the hell do they tax that  song name a p m productions illumination  let is see airbus try that maybe fear that it is too darn heavy and it can not  wow media spend can really make any piece of crap video popular eh  smoother like paper plane done on gta5 all the time nice try boeing lol remember how pilots for truth on 9 11 stated that jet liners in 2001 were absolutely unable to pull the maneuvers necessary for crashing into the towers and the pentagon without disintegrating in mid air well this type of jet liner makes it possible here we see the answer to what pilots for truth on 9 11 were wondering all along what kind of jet liner would be capable to withstand the disintegrating forces associated which such maneuvers this is it boing the chief of the military industrial complex just remember when this type of product gets to the general public is because prototypes have been tested for at least a decade or longer  nice plane so elegant feels like a glider  if it is not boeing i am not going  i thought i can do this only at gta 5  it is hard to tell from the video what kind of angle would the plane have got to at its steepest  but it will blend  can i make loopings too and what happens when it stalls  7 5 mil view for this wtf is wrong with viral videos these days most boring shit gets millions of views nowadays a350 is still better the a380 did it a few years ago in paris it was more amazing from a bigger plane  the scareliner nice wings perfection in flight  wonderful i know when the 707 first came out a boeing test pilot did an unplanned barrel roll in it just to show it off to potential buyers would be good if they could do the same stunt with a 787   all i can say is wow wow wow that is one awesome video and the music is spectacular too  amazing take off even if the shooting conditions obviously have to do with this vertical impression looking forwards seeing it live at the end of the week very nice shooting and the music perfectly serves the images however i heard that this demo is the only one with patrouille de france why they will have to stop traffic on cdg i e they are going out of the cube how comes  but can it do a vertical descend  it does take off vertical wow well someone knows their aerodynamics well beauty  whose is this music no hell no i ai not boarding a thing that does 90 on a take off man at one point i thought its gonna land vertically you wanna puke hop on a roller coaster  one reason for the stunts is to show how strong a boeing is how no matter what a pilot does with the controls it can not be broken quite unlike that airbus in oct 2001 where the pilot managed to snap the tailfin off by whanging the rudder rapidly back and forth a boeing is designed to take such abuse without the aircraft breaking  should have shown the take off from a better angle  does anybody the name of the song or performer  no video sound ok  this is vietnam  no barrel roll  wow well come to vietnam very nice and amazing  scary and astonishing i can get over how steep that climb was very impressive  it flies like a bird  bin laden was flying that plane  she is truely beautiful ever so gently she rocks  im gonna have to strap in for this one xd what no loops no rolls no chaff w t f to thaaat  the bgm is perfect wow b 787 n vertical takeoff wooo wanna experience one like that  when to perform vertical landing  now lets see a vertical landing  wow is not it dangerous to take off like that if only he had hesitated a little while lowering his nose he would have been screwed  by chance is there video from inside the cockpit during this takeoff  not gonna want to sit on a passenger plane flying like this but you can be pretty sure that the us military is gonna have their eyes on this plane  holy shit great plane minimal weight configuration probably excellent camera angles also great music really adds to the experience i would like to see the saw footage still anyway  so it just me or does the way the wings on the dreamliner bend and flex look like the most terrifying thing since scary stuff was invented  i already secretly grab the seat when taking off or when the plane tilts to the side at an extreme oh i would need a drink before i got on this one  i have to believe that every passenger seat all galley equipment and all superfluous safety equipment was removed just enough fuel put on board to keep the aircraft is engines from sucking fumes plus choosing a cool day with low humidity played a part but it is still hugely impressive nonetheless  awesome but when it lands the ambulances must be waiting for those with heart attacks it is scary  what is the name of the music song artist band  simply awesome also music  could other airliners do this with no passengers and a minimal fuel load just because they did not do this the last time you flew ny to la does not mean they can not no matter what you say guys boeing has the best looking planes out there look at the a350 so ugly looking  boeing is sexy just admit it  yea that is impressive but can they land vertically as well d im going to calgery im inlas angelas california me too and can land verticaly also  cool but useless in commercial flight x  i really love this plane and this song anybody knows this music please  daaaaammmn that take off as if gravity dint exist dope   great music everybody pukes  talk about an upgrade better load up on a few shots before you taxi to the runway aboard this thing lol it is just the camera angle that makes it seem go vertically which of course it does not if you would look at the take off from the side it would not be so dramatic but of course they do not show us that for a reason  nothing extraordinary here  thank you great demonstration mmmmmmmm why only 2 engines why not 4 what if both engines die in mid air  can someone explain me what is the point of makingba plane with this features   can not do that with an airbus can you in your face airbus  pilots pilot is the pilot is the pilot is did this without zero g suits crazy  fox do a barrelroll  nice scenario stunning who are the asshats that disliked this video  amazing they really doesnt know the meaning of handle with care  i truly do not see the big deal here  so it can take off near vertical it may be useful at some airports with mountains extremely close the problem is will it take off like that with 335 passengers and their cargo  passenger planes are as sexy as a trolleybus he could at least do a barrell roll  i would pay too see this cool who plays the backround music  i would love to see it grom inside the flightdeck  i am want pilot now  oh god this 787 9 fly how a bird is increible  nice  where is my bag  song is called a p m productions illumination to0 much fuel burned to produce the manuver  did superman record  absolutely awesome i can only imagine what they are going to do at the paris air show can not wait for that video  vietnam airlines boeing 787 9 dreamliner takes off almost vertically incredibly impressive  do a flip holy crap those engines look nice  any commercial jet can take off vertically if you have 5percent fuel no passenger or cargo what no barrel rolls no loop de loops  look at the aerodynamics on the wings so beautiful how can we find the music it is wonderful  experienced pilot vietnam airlines  wow looks like a gta take off  whats the name of the song in the video  personally i like how planes take off at the mo no vertical taking off for me thanks  elegance  so beautiful thank god it does not land vertically  this is impressive performance on video  vertical take offs are easy try vertical landings  i would be horrified to test pilot an airplane but this is pretty sweet beautiful plane  almost there is no gravity in paris  plenty wine lets say angle of attack you have seen was according to procedure the cam dir was flying with his camera tremendous only the pilot job was easy just fly with empty fuselage btw does 777 gear up is sequential  nice music and hd they should fly like that with passengers would be fun ride  well they got a bargain on the music that is for sure  for those of you wondering the name of the song it is called illumination from the album assertive vol 1 a p m productions amazing  how can they release this video and not get a side view shot from the ground for the angle on takeoff i think it would be more impressive from that perspective especially for those who are not as avaionicly savvy  can someone explain what all the hype is about i understand it took off almost vertically but what are the benefits to that  how come plane didnt stall and fall crazy and dangerous if i was on a plane that did that id break in to the cockpit and slap the pilot saying oh no stop it  a wanna be a test pilot   song a p m productions illumination lovely video though i am not a professional videographer excellent music  any idea of the music artist really appreciate if anyone could help name the artist  hello everyone very good great wonderful  beautiful machine congratulations boeing  beautifull wonder of device  handling like gta v d let the europeans stop screwing with the airbus there is nothing to give to the yankee aeronautical industry boeing above all  beautiful aircraft  they were not going to take even the most remote chance of stalling a 787 on climb out so they had to figure out their power to weight ratio which means stripping the airplane of weight and then throttles wide open on rotation good piloting skills too the old dc 3 could climb out on 1 engine this new bird probably can too i am guessing after checking the specs on her ge and rolls royce allison engines  quote boeing some of what you are seeing on takeoff is a trick of perspective says boeing 767 pilot patrick smith it looks like the takeoff is at a near vertical 90 degree angle trust me it is not  in the days when i was a pilot the plane used to do all this on its own and i built the strait  i guess old tex johnson testing the 707 back in 1956 gave these boys an idea radical maneuvering really does sell airplanes tex knew that 59 years ago and boeing despite the obvious did not like it one bit old tex barrel rolled one  to everyone saying wow this things takes off nearly vertically  is the camera view from the side no so you are seeing the tip of the tail well below the engines no so you have just been thrown by the visual trickery of a telephoto lens this plane is still closer to horizontal than vertical look this is a very impressive plane but saying that it flies vertically is just making a mockery the video photography in this video is absolutely outstanding  amazing  who said big planes arent fun xd vietnam airlines and  feel the song  3 can it also land vertically  how is it possible can other planes vertical takeoff it is amazing  check out the various test videos where they put these big birds through full rolls near tailspins and worse they might be big with some extra weight but they can do most acrobatics with enough altitude for safety  sweet ride those test pilots must love this job as for the near vertical takeoff thats so much bs easy to do with a lightweight composite tube wings and 80 000 lbs of thrust at your beck and call also the camera angles they shot this at are deceiving still as most would say if they build it they will come  nice job boeing and all the thousands of subcontractors and the best engine manufacturers in the world  beautiful graceful very powerful beautiful machine  the french like this comment to show that we are present  airplanes are such elegant vehicles honestly this video almost told me what is a right angle gg come talking i am bored can i get likes for no reason  and this plain will be able to chem trail more effectively for you as well get ready for a another manufactured winter with the harrp machine we need our 4th qt earnings i got mine  can they land vertically  what is the cost of war  isis is thinking yay a new plane to blow up wow vertical takeoff almost 90 degree now that is a powerful machine having engineering perfection  song illumination a p m productions   lt 3 y  i am looking for the same way when the plane go down d that perfect touch down  i don t specially love to fly the takeoff is the part i don t like and i saw this vertical omg so scary d but i love to see how that plane flies  did you spot how the undercarriage closes and then re appears a few frames later  why would anyone thumbs down this video would love to hear from you as to what it is about a seemingly neutral video that could illicit such a negative response as to bother giving it a thumbs down how bizarre  like a bird  very impressive a vertical flight wow what if a bug in the embedded computers software occurred quite a risky demo who knows if software bugs are the main cause of recent boeing aircraft disappearance in the indian ocean  like a bird lt 3 awesome awesome  i am impressed how the director must have shot this equally great skills shown by the pilot  nice the plane flies beautifully d now a vertical landing that would be really impressing why would i fly on a plane that does that i would like to keep the food i ate in my stomach please  wow that was positively sensual the take off literally took my breath away the rest seemed as if the aircraft is a living breathing creature of beauty just spreading it is wings and showing off maybe it is the music wow   0 40 holy sh t awsome thanks so much  cool beautiful plane  yawn plane design is just that plain it is the 21st century and the general shape and aesthetics of an commercial aircraft have not changed in 60 years was this taken in moses lake wa  wow this made me realize that i procrastinated too much got a website due tomorrow do a barrel roll  i like the music anyone here can tell me what is that music or if it was original what artist makes similar music  superb professionalism piloting and great man machine combination if it is not computer generated or engineered then the three test pilots and the dreamliner deserves a standing ovation  that how clean them now  beautiful bird amazing it looks like a dragon flying above villages  id like the 747 beautiful plane however the take off footage is a trick of camera angles  boss hey jim jim yeah boss we need to show off this new airliner you up to fly it jim i have had a few drinks but i am sure i could what do you want me to do boss just go up there and fuck around a bit jim okay here hold my beer  ilove vietnam still subsonic crap yawn  i do not know why i am seeing this  less than a minute after takeoff the speed has not picked up yet it is impossible to fly like this it has already stalled  bullshit about three or five years it will be replaced by something else  mh370 likes this this looks fake to me i do not know if it is all the camera angles the way the light reflects off the plane or the sheer size of it but it almost looks like cgi i am no expert on 787 9 is so i could be wrong i am not saying that it is fake it just looks like that to me i would rather be wrong than right i guess i will find out when the air show happens   ladies and gentlemen please prepare yourself for a heart attack as we take off  vietnam airline is the best here is a country buying a plane off boeing and just think it was 40 years ago that vietnam officially brought the u s to their knees and now we are again in the process of having our clocks cleaned in those middle east hell holes  airbus take some notes this is how it is done like a boes  lucky it is not a malaysian aircraft or else  someone gimme a airline ticket for this idc if i do not get first class any class is awesome in this thing  amazing the 51st international paris air show will be held from 15 to 21 june 2015 at le bourget exhibition centre a few kilometres from paris  every flight home from vegas should be like this  i wonder what it feels like when the 787 9 stalls so its inovation is that it can fly vertical but does it helps in something just curious was this taken by a drone  i like it  awesome unz wonder  any idea which song is being played in the back i really liked it did they founded the malaysia plane yet  nooo way great looking aircraft  those tiny wings do not look like they can achieve any lift but they do a great job p everyone today it seems is promoting diversity and multiculturalism but did you ever notice that these things are being promoted in all white countries and only in white countries did you ever wonder why that was the case diversity and multiculturalism if allowed to continue will turn every white country on earth into a non white country within a few decades there will still be plenty of black countries and asian countries under international law this is genocide diversity and multiculturalism are codewords for white genocide anti racist is a codeword for anti white  music red tails trailer music full tilt to glory america is number one export  sameem how was this filmed  i am sure the pilot is argentinian he needs to fly low the blockbuster summer hit the blockbuster avengers 2 people are saying its great its available to view online totally f r e e now you do not have to spend tons of money airbus shakes can u fly it upside down like denzel in flight  impressive but i do not see it doing this with a full cargo  why vietnam  that is some gta 5 flying type shit damn almost went straight up  so cool impressive power wow  just impressive flying like a bird technology is the pusher for humankind development indeed   soothing music well done  ok now try to land verticaly so majestic  ain article i believe states that is camera angles at least according to the pilot that flew the demo i would hazard to guess that the other article me tioned here referencing another vertical take off had similar camera views as this one if i were to speculate i would imagine the 78 would go vertical only once up and once down  i really do not care what maneuvers a passenger aircraft can do i would much rather see how safe the plane is you are carrying human lives i want to see a plane that is idiot proof has countless back ups and even if it does fail some form of safe ejection for the people on board the whole passenger section of the plane should double up as a parachuted boat  these plane models are so out of date we need a better more efficient plane that wont cost so much for a ticket just to travel empty plane not impressed hi  hi whoaahhhh  v e r t i c a l  should of put a 360 cam in the cockpit that is some beautiful flying for something that is basically a bus with wings  is it just me or was that a 75 90 degree take off i just saw  what is this  good more technology more survival would help save lives the structure of both the wings and the fuselage are more resistant than normal so that it can perform these maneuvers so that the plane can take off vertically the power of the engines must be almost double or more the weight of the aircraft and well in a commercial way the weight of fuel passengers and or merchandise increases and it would no longer be possible to perform such complex maneuvers but it is a great advance good help save more lives more technology survival the structure of both wings and fuselage are more resistible than normal so you can perform these maneuvers so that the plane can take off vertically the engine power should be about twice or more the weight of the aircraft and then we in commercially fuel weight of passengers and or goods increase the weights and could no longer perform such complex maneuvers but it is a breakthrough  omg lt 3  without people off course jajaja do not kidding me  the thump downers are air bus employees  add some guns and rockets to it and you will have a very big fighter jet  i am not sure that really happened the shadow does not change like i think it should hmmm  the power response amp control of the boeing 787 9 is so impressive i thought this video may have been done with cgi even without passengers luggage amp a full tank of fuel it is still very impressive who amp how were those brilliant aerial video shots taken  where are the flares its not a plane if it can not avoid missiles  tremendous maneuverability  the wing design looks like it was copied from nature graceful flight almost avian  music a p m productions illumination what are the advantages of an almost vertical takeoff it is unpleasant for the passengers and it is also a waste of fuel  the questions is however how easy is it for the us government to remotely fly this into a skyscraper  amazing the most beautiful airplane in commercial aviation  there go everyone is drinks interesting at full power both engines how many pounds of thrust do they generate  i would be very nervous it looked like a vertical take off   i loved this video hey if you need a volunteer i am available i loved the music also does anyone know what it is called thank you all  can someone explain to me what this is it is not to make fun of me but i want to know what it is  and suddenly a comment in spanish  lol this reminds me of the good old gta san andreas days when you flew the big ship at las venturas airport  its videos like this that inspire 10 year olds all over the work to become pilots while making grown ups envious of the fact that they never dreamed of being pilots  the song a p m productions illumination  asdada simply beautiful by far 787 most revolutionary aircraft ever built by boeing impressive best have plenty of barf bags actually kind of good knowing that a commercial jet can be that agile but not unless needed  that is one sexy dreamliner  hey boeing can you give me any free stuff  so elegant and maneuverable it looks alot smaller than it actually is the wingtips look good as well  wow that maneuver must burn a lot of fuel to make something that size thrust up completely vertical very cool  so maneuverable  cool  randy mike and van are the top of the top guns their extraordinary flying skills makes these amazing and dangerous moves look easy on the large 787 9  i would like to see the side view  i hope people know that this plane is not going to be for domestic flights they are mainly for international flights  did superman take this video  monster just took off vetically is that even safe for commercial airlines are there not any restrictions in place  great blue awsome kudos to the pilot  jaw dropped at second 0 36 so badass  name of soundtrack a p m productions illumination beautiful beautiful gl boeing paris air show 2015 flies great like a toy   no thought about the public safety where is the do not try this at home warning next thing you know everyone will be flying their dreamliner is at low altitude and then where will we be  spectacular but if the normal ones scare me i do not think this is another option for me  it is incredible how it will feel to take off like that it has to crush you against the seat  the a380 is definitely going to attempt this vertical climb cam angle  is the pilot a former fighter pilot those moves looked like a typical f 18 vertical climb off the end of the runway in baden soellingen germany many years ago  gta cinematics what is the name of the song  lightness if it is possible to define it that way  and the captain has turned on the fasten your seatbelts sign  and you may  want to hhheeeeeddd tthat warning oh ya ooh ya buddie the epic music makes me feel something actually really really special happend in this video after paris minx me where is it is next stop  a mazing  add full fuel seats luggage and whole bunch of over weight americans and be thankful it takes off  meanwhile in gta v 4 8 milloin views in 2 days that is astounding and beautiful and freaking terrifying you could not get me in that thing if you paid me a million bucks in cash wow  the takeoff wha but physics big plane go up  a p m productions illumination you are welcome what a beautiful aircraft amazing piloting i hope it is safe as they say it is i know the 787 had a troubled launch but i so desperately want to fly on it  going to need flight training just to be a passenger soon  i want this to be the standard takeoff procedure  i would pay extra for this flight option  please take me for a ride  great video long live vietnam and their magnificent planes  forza vietnam   complete vertical takeoff is illusion  it takes thousands of employees to bring this plane to reality so to all the boeing employees i am humbled amp in awe of your accomplishments well done amp keep up the good work  for everyone claiming the video shows a near vertical takeoff i would ask what are your reference points for vertical i ask this because camera angles can be deceptive i would call near vertical anything above an 80 degree pitch up attitude can someone provide proof of the aircraft is angle of pitch in the takeoff why did they not use a side shot with the horizon clearly visible my guess is that they used a nose on shot to trick us into thinking that this was near vertical again we need to define that term  cool wow it is surprisingly agile for its size incredible  attention passengers please use caution when opening the overhead bins as contents in the overhead bins may shift during takeoff  why vietnam of all names is not boeing a u s corporation we do not get credit for anything anymore if if it is made on our own soil  this why boeing is and always will be miles ahead of airbus good job boeing  nice innovation as long everything does not go flying around the cabin  fantastic the real question is would anyone wanna fly another asian company airline ever again since they all go missing lol aww i was hoping it would do a barrel roll impressive who does the music in this  good god that looked scary if i am not wrong this is exactly the kind of manoeuvre ill fated air asia flight attempted due to bad weather attempting to climb at a very high angle and stalled as result i wish this tech was available in that plane as well  i think there should be special airlines for people who would like to be on the plane to enjoy such stunts  the best i this smoothness  when i saw the thumbnail i did not expected that much but this vertical take off was really jaw dropping and after seeing all the stunts i must say hats off to the boeing engineers  amazing take off  passengers are throwing up xdddddd look on my account at my videos but only if you like football and great advert i can do that hold my beer  it is amazing i am impressed by this  comes with state of the art puke bags  what is the music it is fantastic i will admit the near vertical take off was impressive but what got my attention more were the low level low speed maneuvers you know the ones where the flaps and slats were extended the high aoa turns not to mention those carbon fiber wings flexing like that i was seriously impressed bravo boeing bravo  extreme maneuvers of the boeing 787 extraordinary that is why boeing has been reliable for so long its materials and equipment are noble resistant and safe hence its international fame not even close to a near vertical take off did it show a side view no  imagine taking off with full capacity it will be a thrill ride  it flies like a toy use of promotional music is so distracting and irrelevant to such videos but used for years by the aircraft industry in an attempt to build drama they think the 787 9 probably can do a vertical climb for a few moments with enough takeoff speed no passengers or cargo and light fuel load but it cannot be sustained as we saw many jets can do that  if the pilots are so foolish as to try  good jet for long non stop routes 9k miles interesting wingtip design it must be fun to be a test pilot  i wouldnt want to be a passenger  this is beutifull plane what a beautiful amazing machine  i do not mean to be negative but why would anyone want to fly on this what does it achieve except terrifying elderly passengers giving pilots a new way to screw up banging the tail off the runway and making everyone lose their lunch while their belongings pens cups phones and papers are flung into the face of the person behind them its hard enough maintaining civility among passengers on a flight now as it is without turning a simple flight into a roller coaster with children screaming people wailing and fights breaking out over someone is barf bag landing in the lap of the person behind them if you thought coach was bad now    edit i think i understand now they do not actually intend to fly them commercially this way thank god that is a relief at least i darn well hope they do not    i have never liked flying or the casual attitude towards it you step into a multi ton metal tube are placed under martial law and then are deliberately suspended five miles above the ground by deliberately burning explosive chemicals then when it goes wrong call it an accident show any other primate another primate being put into a metal tube and being flung into the sky and then try to coax him into stepping into the other one animals have more sense to avoid a trap i just do not see hundreds of lives per year being an acceptable cost to the business of moving people faster people always say that its statistically safer than driving see if that math works when you have as many planes as there are cars on the road i do not see why no one designs something where the cabin is divided into eject able compartments sort of like life boats 50 people each parachute drag and small rockets it would at least give people a chance when heading towards a mountain or building a challenge but not impossible i just find the irony a bit nauseating that whenever there is an air disaster the first thing the talking heads on television remind you is how its safer than driving like how television advertised cigarettes daily soda consumption various medicines all so safe in 60 years of nuclear power we have had nearly a hundred accidents and now we have over 400 reactors world wide the crazy crap we will put up with to make a buck  wow profile view please overhead is awesome but the profile view would be more impressive  how did they film that take off wow too much pull up oop  i would still prefer a yak 40 over this  it is nice but it would be better to watch it do the same fully loaded with equivalent weight as if with passengers and luggage the performance of any aircraft varies very much depending upon its power to weight ratio  90 you take off wow no problem i probably can not afford your plane  this 787 9 flight looked awesome  boeing vietnam i guess they were impressed by another boeing product the b 52 lol 1 the lateral image is missing land level angle take off moment i mean 2 the plane is empty 3 was 100percent manual control  so is quite sure are there more planes that can do this   im never flying cathay again book me a flight with this captain please  had to do this in gta for a mission  amazing piece of superb american engineering  one wonders why vn airlines was so impractical as to paint the body top section dark blue incurring considerable extra cost in cooling while operating in southeast asia  should of rolled it anything else is just flying around light weight  what a beautiful plane this is imagine the power behind this for the take off and all the moves i can not wait to fly in a 787 why did not they film the part where it catches on fire  i am from vietnam and i find it vietnam airlines that takeoff gave me goosebumps  i want to see it landing vertically too   music  boeing is respect for pilot is control of the aircraft i e more manual control is sexy and should be an inspiration to other aircraft manufacturing companies  like that capability if having to avoid another large item but how will a carbon fibre body deal with heavy winds with so little weight  holy cow it takes of almost vertically without stalling well done boeing  i like the way it fly  many many good wish for boeing  beautiful enough said  song  amazing really impressive  badass i would never have thought it possible  this is beyond awesome  love it  p s boeing can i get a flight like this once in my life please  future  i suddenly have a new fear of flight  music  holy shit  wow made my stomach flip watching the take off  beautiful plane  the upwards dihedral is pretty cool looking  many of you asked so here it is download music here   one question why  wow what a beautiful birdy stunning as graceful as a bird congratulations you deserve the right to be proud of yourselves for this piece of art  very eloquent and beautiful aircraft it must be amazing seeing your work fly around like that these things are part of the pollution problem made worse by you sheep using them  you have only your selves to blame you helped burn the bridges and your folks kick their asses not mine  for passengers that moment will make them feel like they are seating roller coaster btw i did not get the advantage of this move from boeing can someone tell me how they filmed this drone helicopter or superman  a good plane these are not russian jalopies  amazing liner see how it soars  wow i wanna test it right away ladies and gentleman this your pilot speaking we are taking off petal to the metal highway to hell plays softly in the background thank god it would not be able to do this when its full with crew passengers and luggage music illumination by a p m productions that was beautiful was there meant to be water on the runway when the plane landed or was that just my eyes deceiving me  gta was this shot on a drone  can anyone tell name of music thanks beauty  can not wait to take a trip in one of these wow wow  whats so exciting about this i do not get it  i would never thought of flying vietnam airlines up until now that is how much is a ticket to anywhere   h  waiting for brazilian flight companies to acquire this we europeans love boeing way more then airbus safer amp sexier   what a beauty  like a sleek shark with wings  incredible that such an enormous machine can be so graceful in the air  what kind of music is playing write the artist please  the music played in background of this video is by a p m productions it is called illumination  you are welcome  wait until you have seen the video filmed inside the aircraft they had just been served their lunch  lol good morning vietnam  it took off like a helicopter  gliding machines beautiful  would have been more impressed with the vertical takeoff if it was at full capacity passengers fuel and cargo i am sure e even the current boeing 747 or others can do the same when empty sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee omg is this real take off almost vertical  brilliant engineering  what was the big deal with this  they took my x plane data and put it in auto pilot it is how i always fly nothing better than an non automatic flight  am more impressed by that perfect landing  for those comparing this to a380 this one carry is 280 passengers max and weights far less then a380 a380 i checked on google carry is 853 passengers per ride there is a massive difference this is excluding the things inside of plane too the plan weights ally more then this one this means that yes it can not fly vertically like 787 9 dreamliner as the plane is just that bigger then 787 9 and also the plane has a lot of other things included making it one of the worlds best  amazing movie amazing  if you thought this was good then try this in a empty 757 200 with rb211 it will be even more of a rocket   vietnam  i was scared watching that take off  must be either a raptor or a sukhoi pilot it is beautiful like bird soaring above creation as if to say hey creation look up here at me  cause i am a bird and im soaring ddddeeeeerrrrr that was a joke about how birds are dumb yet we still use them in poetry so stooped for more joke like this one follow me on twitter brianjames thmd no really please follow i am desperate for your validation  captain we are about to give you an experience of a space shuttle fasten your seat belts for real  warning do not try this at home  tgvvvv  albear972 we are aware that if you add more payload factors to the aircraft it will be harder to fly but the intention of this is just to be presented at an airshow can not believe i will be there  manouvres of a jet fighter is this gta that is one insane aircraft i applaud you boeing you guys are phenomenal  i do not have to be so excited to take off lol you can not turn the camera on the plane during takeoff too bad o boeing prepares the 787 9 dreamliner for the 2015 paris air show  almost vertically awesome  she is lovely  it looks awesome from outside definitely horrific from inside as passengers you need to have the experience of ridding a shuttle launch simulator as it there in kennedy space center to bear with such awesome take off  many years ago i read a book about 747 1985 as i remember it also has many similar qualities amp capablities including vertical take off can fly with only one engine and was designated the most reliable safe well designed plane to date amp most commercial use to date but as beautiful as they are air crashes still happen  perfect for john wayne airport take offs  the editing on this is garbage especially on departure show it from one angle   made in usa wow  why do they say it lands the same  awesome power  spectacular o this plane looks like articuno from pokemon 0 o my husband was part of the team that designed one of the main transformers i am super proud of him hopefully we will be at the airshow next weekend to watch her fly   that is a pretty impressive climb out from takeoff even fighter jets wait til the gear is up before they go vertical wonder if that was planned or wise  boeing for the win  nice who all are aircraft enthusiast out there and what is your favorite airliner for me 737 900 beautiful not sure i would like to be in that take off though might take the train  let is see what it does loaded what was its fuel load this means little  i wish i could see the take off from a side angle  us man meo coming to vietnam you will feel a beautiful and peace country  awesome just like a toy in the pilot is hands omg i love to feel my heartbeat during takeoffs just thrilling wish they had showed a side view of the precise moment too great job anyway and the music is very nice as well  i found something new i added to put on my bucket list  what a beauty some beautiful lines on this one even for a bus  i i can not stop re watching that takeoff  where can i find the music  here is a clue we are watching this to see a plane fly not listen to insipid music at high volume fire the clown who made this  the comment in spanish asecha so tan taannn  fantastic i would love to try it   what a beautiful sight thanks for sharing this with us jesus christ bless  crazy awesome the plane is beautiful to watch but why the edit at 48 just as he is leveling off  editor f would that up would love to see uncut footage  so is the updated 787 going to have actual shutters so we can sleep instead of those fancy electric shaders that do not help when you face the sun  amazing that wing flex is a beauty  great but will i arrive to my destination any faster rhetorical question of course  that is pretty majestic for a flying tube of farts beyond impressive  nice  vietnam airlines will be the first carrier in asia to operate both airbus a350 and boeing 787 9 this year  amazing it taxi climbs up in about 1 1 2 new york city block so where can i buy one  boeing continually rules in aerospace and airplane design and performance the company has a very long history of producing the finest aircraft built amazing company  the boeing 787 is the albatross of planes with nearly 200 foot wing span this plane has 2 ge engines producing 142 000lbf of thrust that is half the thrust of a airbus 380 that has 4 engines and weighs 610 200 lb empty the 787 9 weighs 259 500 lb empty half the power and a third of the weight one badass plane  boeing is boeing the king beautiful  amazing good choice vietnam airlines  fantastic perfect  nice demonstration did not think a plane like that could pull a maneuver like that going almost vertical from take off now let is see how it handles when the plane is full of fuel people and luggage  too bad rex was not the pilot i ld love to see what he would do with it i saw him do a 1g roll in a 707 test flight hahhaha it is here somewhere on youtube  ballet of the albatross do a barrel roll i can do this on grand theft auto 5  how are the mid air parts of this video filmed  those pilots are having a grand o l time with that plane  a carbon fiber thoroughbred  wow  that was shocking and awesome  trevor not this again  anyone know the name of the music  over 70 degrees take off imagine the engine thrust boeing  cool video and all but does anyone know the song name i liked it a lot and been scrolling threw the comments for the name and i can not find it  the new age the new age wow what a take off  near vertical take off i cannot wait to get on one of these  that boeing is awesome they gona put airbus out of business vietnam airlines gets extra milage by filling the cargo hold with agent orange  go america  an awesome take off for sure near vertical well i do not think so in fact not even close careful photography yeah for sure i would guess it is maybe 50 degrees nose up i would like to see the side angle or a shot of the pfd  this is crazy wow how  you ma drone was  yes this is flying woop woop its grant county international airport  vietnam airlines rocks  holy views batman  i would like to see a side view  i watched that whole video waiting for it what a letdown     flown on a dreamliner twice now first to the caribbean in march and the second last week to mexico much quieter than the 747s we usually fly love the big adjustable tinted windows if i had the choice this is how i would fly  amazing takeoff  how on earth did it not stall  is the amazing boeing 787 incredible this makes me want to get up and take the next jet somewhere  truly awesome  will it land vertically as well though  does it come with that new plane smell  damn things a fighter jet pulling up like that tell ya one thing they better not give me something to drink on take off god damn   jeez that take off guys  congrats boeing  its amazing how much technology has achieved this is unbelievable sounds corny but that thing really maneuvers like a bird just incredible way to go boeing  now thats a smooth landing like a leaf falling in the ground  rip luggage  to infinity and beyond  this shows and explains the saying if it are not boeing i am not going can not wait to fly this plain as soon as possible  a321 pilotgaming hello everyone who understands at least a little about the laws of optics hello to the smart ass operator too song title and artist please  that is one sexy airplane  live the dreamliner  best livery in the industry love it  this is cool would this just be for show or could there be benefit s for doing these maneuvers in a commercial setting   waits for vertical landing too  name of tune in video anyone  look at those engines dumping pollution into our atmosphere at a massive rate at least we can take comfort in know it will all be over soon  fantastic airplane but i wonder why boeing chooses bland video production and music instead of going with a top agency to produce these videos  fred  i honestly thought the plane was going to do a backflip at the start  i was like oh shit this is gonna be good nope not for me sorry  this is awesome  congratulations boeing amazing craftsmanship and technical design  fake relax no aircraft of this type cand take of vertically its impossible video editing boeing propaganda  incredible airplane  so on my way to the destination i get a free rollercoaster ride at takeoff d woah omg this is crazy this is epic  nah wrong choice for the background music should be danger zone  yep really interesting  every time i watch it that takeoff  he should roll it like tex johnson in the 707  simply everything in this video is a beauty the plane the background the acrobatic moves and for sure the music it is people who design things like this that should be paid the big money compare what people who design such amazing structures like this to footballers earning hundreds of thousands a week the world is unfair and unbalanced  this stunt apparently flown by a veteran fighter pilot that was awesome  tex johnston would have followed up with a triple barrel roll on this thing  super just fantastic incredible i have flown a lot in my lifetime but for a passenger jet this is just wild bravo zillion thumbs up boeing and the music who made it best jp communists buy amazing american capitalist planes  humans are just show offs i climbed a tree the other day  super movie  fake video the shadow on the track does not match the tilt angle of the rise from the ground  do a barrel roll my stomach churned a little watching this video o i have yet to fly a 787  wow that is awesome damn near vertical  vietnam fox rock is czar oui  from the bbc all aircraft with more than one engine have to be able to take off with less than full power if an aircraft has two engines it has to be able to take off with one if it has four then it must be able to climb into the air with three in the 787 is case both engines running normally means there is an awful lot of spare power to be used if needed carrying no passengers or cargo helps too  what music is this just some corporate music or a commercial track i really like the percussion in it boeing is this location moses lake  camera angle does a lot but anyway beautiful to watch it  the song name is illumination by a p m productions it is on itunes thumbs up so everyone can see  is it actually going to take off like that with passengers or are they just showing off  not try vertical landing  majestic vietnam airlines have pulled off a great one  how beautiful was this  superb  now that is a big stol so graceful when void of passengers and cargo poetry in motion  i insist that on my next airflight that my captain takes off just like this  whats the name of the song just do not say that is darude sandstorm guys plox that is a positive rate gear up  lets hope it does not catch fire like it used to do great skill i wonder how did they filmed it  stall    d that takeoff  they start doing this take off in commercial flights and i switch to team airbus  not near vertical here are the clues  1 it is a sponsored video and no one seems to have any independent footage of it  2 it is odd not to capture a profile shot of a truly near vertical takeoff because it would be a spectacularly impressive shot and the shots were clearly planned  3 the camera gives the runway an orthogonal look which really suggests it is close to vertical but you can fake this by zooming in from a distance which is probably what happened as i doubt they put an observation plane directly in the flight path at takeoff  4 the framing cuts off the shadow as soon as it lifts off which would tell us what angle it is climbing at and is precisely the kind of reference you want in a shot like that to convey spatial relationships my hunch is that it is a lot closer to 45 degrees which i feel intuitively would still create a stall at that low speed and that the quick correction saves the day in any event definitely an insane maneuver made me wonder what vietnam airlines was thinking as far as the promotional value is concerned we are risk takers welcome aboard i guess we will find out soon enough at the paris air show when we start to see spectator video of this rehearsal of the near vertical takeoff that was caught on camera  anybody has the name of the song  the most expensive laxative there is  holy hel i was going nope nope nope during that take off holy wow i was hoping for a barrel roll as was done in 1955 seattle air show with boeing 707  incredible video and performance of this beautiful bird kudos also to the pilots and designers  i want my plane to do this the next time i go somewhere gt d there is no point in comparisons with the a380 which is a different category if anything the b747 8 might be compared to the a380 while i prefer the a350 over the b787 one thing that can not be denied is this takeoff is simply stunning and that is not just the amazing camera perspective  cool this means you can land in san diego is tiny cramped airport  i am blown away this is amazing also the wing span d god this plane is a thing of beauty  o o wow  it is not vertical you can tell from how the runway is angled as it takes off probably more like a 40 50 degree up angle which is still pretty damn impressive  so very very cool i cannot stop watching this video there are three guys upfront that are having a blast too  ok who did the soundtrack for the 787 9 video anyone  as long as it does not land vertically  welcome on board vomit airlines flight chunder007 we hope you have brought a spare change of clothes have a pleasant stomach emptying experience ho know the music in that video share please one has to admit that is a very good pr vid for boeing and for the plane in particular  amazing photography of this beautiful aircraft   this reminds me of the huge plane in gta san andreas it will be so huge but still would do stunts with it  how did they film that take off with another 787 9 in the lead  that is an impressive take off new airplanes new flaws is this video available without the music  that was a horrible angle they should have shot from the side epic fail on the filming  insane like a huge graceful bird very cool   could be a ride attraction at disney lol there is not much left of american pride in manufacturing but there is still one industry left putting up a fight aircraft i hope boeing blows the french out of the water judging from this short video they might  wow might be the best vietnam airlines commercial ever show completely reformulated  boeing one hell of an engineering firm would be my dream to work for you guys  tune illumination a p m productions quite the chassis for a zippy gunship and it can deliver fedex and ups is packages too  wooooooahhhh ever seen a school bus drift that is just what this is like but in the air  very very impressive  what a scam for suckers a passenger plane has such a mass that it will not allow it to fly let alone vertically even at a high angle and even more so immediately after takeoff it is fake  what a gorgeous bird  it almost flew like f16 must watch boeing preps the 787 9 dreamliner for farnborough the 2014 rehearsal video thriller killer  i saw the 747 make a landing at short air field in renton wa that was amazing the new 787 take off vertical is also amazing  folks it is and old camera trick watch the bottom edge of the video with respect to the cracks in the runway they move with the oncoming plane is direction of travel until the moment they want you to think it is gone vertical then they slow the relative motion to zero and then start moving toward the oncoming plane it makes the actual 55 degree angle look like 90 degrees because at that point you are disoriented as to the camera is angle which is now pointing down at the belly of the craft  9 11 was good i always close my eyes and imagine that i am in a space rocket when the plane takes off this takes it to a whole new and authentic level scary nonetheless  beautiful wings interesting wing tips they do not point up but that take off would scare the heck out of the passengers awesome flying characteristics  watch on 2x speed  a flight simulator ride like this would be a hit at universal  that looks awesome in a oh my god this is how i die kind of way  beautiful aircraft near vertical takeoff from a boeing 787 9 dreamliner amazing more of these types of videos commercial aircraft builders d excellent impressive video and airplaien boeing is the best i wish i was with you on that test flight and that was a picture perfect landing boeing pampers  next time show a side perspective  wow loved it thanks for sharing lt lt  do a barrel roll  side view please  that was so amazing to watch my heart kinda sank when i saw it go straight up from the runway honestly i could not stomach that  nice show but where is the mh 370 which disappeared in vietnam air space  this flight have a pilot  pilot1 hey buddy top humping the stewardess the runway is at it is end  pilot2 huh oh  it is like i am playing gta v excelent aircraft amp video incredible hats off to boeing  i wanna cockpit view of a vertical takeoff like this  well that answers the question of who made the uss enterprise  adobe after effect  fly fly a perfect flight and excellent photography  very disappointed boeing did not offer a shot of the takeoff from the side only way to really understand how incredibly steep that angle was lost opportunity  while taking off vertically is impressive the kamakazis mastered landing vertically slightly more impressive  looks a great plane to fly in especially if some of them moves were incorporated  this is totally unbelievable  that is one plane the rock would like to fly on  it will come out missing soon  there is a lot of dihedral on this wing  please use caution when opening overhead bins as items may have shifted during the flight  while watching this i kept on thinking what it would feel like as a passenger if you did such moves  no stall  for those who know whats the worst thing that could happen to a normal plane taking off like this considering that originally everything is good mechanically but caused by a take off like this what could possibily go wrong  i flew flew on one to africa with ethiopian airline very spacious  those wings  amazing  pilots been playing to much gta great skills a hell of a plane and great pilots  would be worth the ticket just for the roller coaster ride sensational take off oh my sweet freaking jesus i want a ride like that that looks like such a freaking blast  good thing i was not on that plane the people behind me would not like it too much  comfortable no longer need for long runways  looks like the pilots were having some fun the take off was impressive although did not think the banks made were nerve wracking it actually looked fun would have like to been up there with them  great music also this plane is spectacular what power the engines must have for that practically vertical takeoff with the tons it weighs incredible  tough  can someone tell my the title of the music it was quite chilling thanks in advance  a thing of beauty  i would really like to see the takeoff from the ground at a distance is it so hard to gauge the impressive nature of this takeoff with such camera angles what an impressive plane though  i wonder what kind of g forces are being pulled with such a lift off like that  the musick name  now civil planes are as mobile as military planes  no mods show me the vertical landing then i will be impressed  it looks so elegant such an attractive plane  no cargo powerful engines boeing good good now release the 0 point energy ftl craft and we are good  dangerous flying  i have been in the airline industry a long time and i have seen some interesting scary and amazing things very little surprises me anymore but that takeoff for that type of aircraft that is nothing short of unbelievable looking forward to seeing one of these beauties up close and personal  spectacular designed for these times of threats these maneuvers can save lives very good design and when the details are known everyone will want to fly in this flyer which i am sure is equipped to be in better conditions to avoid complicated issues those wings are great i want  precisely this kind of hot dogging got my uncle killed in a convair 880 at the atlanta airport in 1961 not funny  very impressive but can it land vertically  no doubt it is a great aircraft but it is take off is a pretty common trick at airshows inside there are no passengers luggage or freight and only enough fuel for about 45 mins of flight this makes it super light add that to the fact the pilot is hitting the gas early for a touch of showmanship and you get this in normal service it will do what they all do  wow boeing that is spectacular in every way and congratulations because i know making a 787 9 dreamliner do a vortical takeoff was extremely difficult and it is just so beautiful to watch  that is crazy to think that plane pretty much handles like a remote controlled one the manoeuvres are just weird looking at it  does a bib come with take off drink and a sick bag lol amazing take off and flight and a good sound track to go with video good for take off but  for landing do not landing like this whats the song called  i wonder how close they had to come to stalling the aircraft to pull off that brief vertical portion of the takeoff   i like horses is it just me or i see the tail at the end of the video shaking like crazy imagine there is a hard landing the back would get destroyed  omg  why was there not a shot from the ground showing the near vertical take off  every flight i take feels exactly like that  an unbelievably spectacular aircraft and a woefully poor video and editing job the shots were so tight and close up it took away any perspective the take off was the best part but instead of shooting from the side to see the angle of takeoff it is shot from the belly really kids with a uav and iphones and imovie could have done a better job of shooting and editing that too bad  do a barrel roll   awesome spectacular  i did not think a large aircraft could do maneuvers like a swallow  does a320 can take off l ke this video  super light and super strong thats what i like  dat thrust song  not gonna be impressed until i see a barrel roll  that was beautiful i always get pumped on the plane as it pulls into the runway and commences the epic pause before takeoff  clearly been messing around on gta 5 p call me when it can transform that was pretty damn cool the thing about the vertical takeoff is that during the show i presume it was not loaded with anything which means that it is lighter than it would be with passengers and luggage it was pretty damn sweet though d its like gta 5 inpressive that is a stunning take off and a beautiful airplane  suddenly my plane takeoffs in kerbal space program look a lot more civilized  does your mom or the vietnamese know you took the plane out for a spin  who is going to say i want to be a passenger in a takeoff like this   i can not believe you guys did this amazing take off footage just from 1 angle omg  knowing my luck i will be on the one that goes straight up and then falls straight back down onto it is back and then explodes  i would love to see that takeoff from some different camera angles impressive airplane  i love the wings it looks like a bird  that pitch up at the takeoff holy smokes how close to stall was that  note to self do not take flights on 787 9 is wow that was amazing makes me miss my air crafting days at boeing  how do planes fly does it just go super fast that it just lifts up its own are planes really light  but can it land the same way it took off  can the plane actually climb at that angle or is it strategic videography  breathtaking kind of expected this guy or girl to do a friggin roll somewhere after watching it take off like that  looks like a toy magnificent cinematography beautiful aircraft  engineering fam beautiful livery on a awesome plane bravo boeing  awesome  thats mental levels of engineering cool airplane but what is the name of the soundtrack the music was great  dunno weather i trust this especially when its vietnam airlines s better have a good supply of those little white bags fun to watch nightmare to be in  that drag tho steel beams jet fuel cannot melt  because that will not make you sick at all  shows you there is some serious grunt maybe bigger aircraft now for smaller airports d 90 degree vertical takeoff roll amazing 0 35  it is so big but so agile it looks like it is just floating through the air for a moment i forgot the size of that thing and i thought that it flies nicely like a big graceful bird  thumbs down for the video editing lets us see the damn plane in one view for more than 5 seconds nice plane though  but can it do it while landing that is the question  sick  name of music pls fake camera angles can anyone explain to me what the advantage is of taking off in such a way like i am genuinely interested like not in a sarcastic way but i legit wanna know would be great if someone can explain  its simpel the motors just go vertical thats it but can it land vertically   no doubt performance and elegance  great i like music would like to see footage of the takeoff from two different angles one on the ground in front of plane one on the ground to side of the plane filming from the lead plane looking down is certainly dramatic but distorts perception of the angle of climb in that initial dramatic takeoff for dramatic purposes of course and it is very successful at that still i would love to see the takeoff from the other two angles  i wish i was riding in it  better order more barf bags  bravo makes me proud to be a citizen of the usa  wonder if this thing could take off like that with passengers inside  the shape of the wings is elegant  all take off is should be like that  music credits if anyone knows please share thx  sexy plane beautiful  if you can not beat em  funny how a capitalist country and a private company had to build a great plane for the communist country of vietnam where are all the vietnamese built planes most likely at the bottom of the ocean  90 degrees takeoff  stewardess i seemed to have spilled my drink and soiled myself lolol amazing flying there    empty weight is 138 tons the combined thrust of the two engines is 640 kn so for a vertical climb the airplane would have to weigh less than 65 tons the maximal climbing angle would have to be less then 28 degrees so the apparent breath taking climb must be an illusion nevertheless it is a beautiful bird but not a rocket  reminds me of the 757 and looks like it how they film this  shows the raw power of those engines when there is no real load to push around no pax no cargo i bet they kept fuel to a minimum and the wing flex just beautiful  what an amazing aircraft  fifty years ago in march b 52s built by boeing began bombing vietnam in operation rolling thunder now they are selling passenger cargo airplanes to vietnam how times have changed perhaps for the better  beautiful aircraft a wonderful feat of engineering what does taking off on an empty plane mean  this is mad  i am guessing this plane was almost completely empty would it be able to do the same manoeuvre full of passengers and luggage it is a bit like saying a truck cab can do a 3 point turn without it is trailer  amazing how it did not strike it is tail is beyond me  perfect us is no1 god the 787 9 is a magnificent looking aircraft and so is everett field awesome video boeing and i am happy that you chose vietnam airlines for this video and for the paris air show they really deserve it d aviation avgeek boeing  hope i do not spill my drink on take off  it is superb it will always impress me  incredible respect  those poor poor passengers just trying to get to toledo to see their son graduate from college and they get these pilots  would have like to hear how much power was applied to the engine for that vertical take off but sadly we can not over the god damn music in every single video with a plane  boeing or i am not going take that airbus  i would barf it the plane took off straight up like that  is this with the rolls royce trent or ge engines  when they say buckle up you better buckle up   if it ai not boeing i am not going congrats with this magnificent pice of machinery  what is up with the wings they look so majestic  the easiest way to go vertical or nearly so on takeoff is to get to rotate speed pull back on the controls just enough to get the wheels off the ground and raise them stay low and build up speed while in ground effect where induced drag is minimal then pull back hard and zorch into the sky what makes this video look more impressive is that they started the climb while the gear were extended which is a crapload of drag on the plane seems they were at or near their maximum pitch before raising the gear that is impressive gear down tricks usually are when the blue angels used to fly a 4 is and do an aileron roll on takeoff with the gear extended was an amazing thing to see the camera angle does not allow us to see how long the takeoff roll was though any plane can go nearly vertical for a short period of time if you roll down the runway far enough to build up max speed i am impressed by the video but would like to see this from a side angle before i am truly floored by its capability that would show the roll distance before rotate and give a better idea of the actual pitch angle which may have looked exaggerated by the overhead camera angle  what a magnificent bird so agile wings swept back and arched like a hawk in top speed dive mode but at all times and with jet engines   wow i know she would push the envelope but i dint know the bobble was so big let alone know that she could feel the edges good work guys good work  this adds a whole new meaning to vtol  how can they take this videos  hey guys im curious whats the rpm for a cruising passenger jet aircraft and a helicopter  if it aint boeing i aint going  beautiful  i know that steep takeoff would not happen during commercial flights but could you imagine if there was a time that it was merited and you were on board honey i can not wait to see what the bahamas lo what the hell  suck it airbus  wow how do they get away without having winglits  noisiest plane and narrowest business pitch i experienced but beautiful plane  love the footage camera angles are superb love to know how they filmed it  totally awesome even better than the dash 8 thats is what you call energy management  they filmed this in my town moses lake washington we get the prevelage to see all kinds a planes being tested here  we do not have any details about the payload on board i suppose it is an empty aircraft customized for such manoeuvres dreamliner is most advanced commercial plane in the air does the on board computers allow such manoeuvres  it is great amazing video but really if u already have alot of 777s in your fleet i find it hard to upgrade to the dreamliner  wow what a beauty boeing will dominate the industry if this plane is half as good as it looks  poorly filmed and edited you can do much better  gorgeous absolutely beautiful the picture of elegance good job hope you did not use catia to design the wing points  16 ab fan reminds me of gta san andreas hehehehe i feel sick simply the shizz suck on it airbuzz  out of all the airliners it had to be the one that destroyed my country t t man i just love the 787 9 dreamliner i mean  that takeoff  d now i want to see it do this loaded with passengers and luggage  how was it able to stay up with the weight of the flight crews massive balls  please put you tables amp seats in the up right position  vietnam airlines  i bet those are navy pilots flying that plane  wow that was awesome  this airplane has a very striking livery  so beautiful in flight beautiful  man i gotta get me one of these  what a beautiful and elegant airplane i have seen a couple of them in the air around new york and they are perfectly proportioned and very quiet boeing seems to have finally gotten it right what a shame that boeing manglement is incredible blunders on the 787 8 program allowed airbus to go to school on boeing is mistakes since both manufacturers use so many of the same outsourcing partners and kicked the door wide open for the a350xwb had boeing managed the 8 with a modicum of common sense they could have dominated this market segment for a generation  screw vietnam i would not those bastards the time of day  great if you need to outrun ground to air missile but did they fix the batteries  quite a take off wonder what they flew before becoming airline pilots probably the prettiest airliner i have seen good job boeing  wow incredible that almost vertical takeoff though  nice zoom climb on takeoff amazing airplane it would be interesting to know what the actual weight to thrust ratio of that plane is  way to go vietnam  now lets get started on round trip flights vietnam u s a plz  incredible awesome plane move over airbus boeing is here to sell planes a whole lot of them let is see you top this  imagine what tex johnson would have done with this plane  this era of aviation could be remembered very fondly what a beautiful aircraft  a boeing not blowing up is always a good thing  i am wondering how they recorded video on these angle from another plane i guess but it is awesome  powered by efficient genx engines filmed in moses lake wa  do a barrel roll wow  this beats any of my test flight footage hands down this video is better than the airbus formation  but it runs and the driver drives it as if he were going out with his car for a ride around the city spectacular  i will take 30  pilots are an insanely badass elite group they all deserve great pay and benefits from the very beginning of their careers to the very end  does anybody else see the wonderful irony of using a vietnamese airplane to highlight an american manufacturers latest aviation technology  a masterpiece boeing is boeing i hope to work at this company  depending if it is the ge or rolls royce engine each engine has 53 78 thousand pounds of thrust so 116 156 thousand pounds of thrust probably 1 2 or less fuel load no cargo or passengers it is easy to pull a steep climb takeoff you can bet the design engineers went over the wing loading numbers you will notice after it starts to level out it drops a bit in altitude since there is not much forward thrust to provide the wings with lift heck the blue angels do something similar with fat albert c 130 with jato rato bottles strapped to the sides pretty cool video though  i love this airplane excellent vid all too short  amazing  that is about the worst perspective to film that amazing liftoff but still an incredible testament to the power and aerodynamics of this technological wonder d great plane yee haw now that is some high alpha takeoff overpowered much great ride  looks like it goes up 90 degrees at the start holy moly terrible camerawork and drone operating you would think a company as big as boeing could find someone who could frame a shot and follow a moving subject awful music too but that is far more common in these kind of vids  a very pretty airplane and she seems to fly like a fighter i felt my guts drop from that insane rotation also does anyone but me find it ironic that the vietnamese national airline would be purchasing boeing products just sayin   amazing loved how it was filmed wonderful show i visited vietnam in 2013 by air vietnam 777 amp had a wonderful time of course i will be back  hopefully by 787  what an angle of ascent  give me a looping and some rolls to show the thing can stand bad weather  impressive piece of flying for the rehearse flight for paris airshow wow you guys did again lol i love you boeing company  dream one airbus   100percent cool video like the take off cheers from michigan oh wow  sick takeoff so why would vietnam airlines order the 787 and a350 curious  incredible footage  boeing need to add a smoke kit to the wings it would produce some cool vortices   lt 3  that takeoff was borderline dangerous awesome  amazing takeoff lt 3 super awesome this will be awesome  amazing tangage after take off  wow incredible photography i love it  what airport was this filmed at  wow   the music is meh but the video is incredible  awesome video boeing could you pls show us the cockpit footage with some gopros mabye thank you god bless america ohh i mean boeing  holy shit look at that takeoff  my fav part of the video at 0 38 beautiful videography boeing very nice views of this flight  the takeoff reminds me of the blue angels fat albert takeoff  god what an amazing machine great job  absolutely stunning well done expert crew take off wow almost vertical the editing got in the way put up the raw footage please  you had me at vx  most of the flying was boring but that take off was bad ass for a commercial airliner usually only see military jets do that kind of near vertical ascent  wow what a taken  will be awesome if they did the same test with the 777 9x also love to watch the stalling test  boeing build the best airplanes  boeing is the best commercial airplane in the world the plane is beautiful airplane with horn control as it should be and not like others with so many computers  where did they film this  one of the best movie i ever seen  seen more trust me  vietnam xd amazing  wow it is amazing  just no words how are the external shots filmed drone chase plane ground based camera with big telescopic lens  so dreamy so powerful this was  amazing wow that take off that dreamliner can sure climb amazing piece of engineering  waw  looks like an eagle hovering above its prey  bank angle bank angle that looks like so much fun i would love to go on that ride  its so lightweight and agile great design guys  elegant and exquisite beautiful plane beautiful  would love to see this from the flight deck  i love these special boeing videos every summer  what a bird  fantastic footage for a great plane  vietnam airlines beautiful livery  that is insanely cool i never thought an airliner could do that  that steep take off tho love it fantastic  amazing takeoff  great video love the aircraft and love the livery simply attractive and really nice all the best for the pas 2015 air show  can not wait to have the pilots do this on my flight oh wait that is not what airliners are for why boeing the plane is empty and light what is the point in showing manuevers that will not be done once in service signed a boeing fan  this is purely amazing also did it go vertical at take off or was it the camera angle  wow that angle of climb is crazy  amazing  i would like to share and keep it for yourself boeing 787 9 the picture angle is really beautiful very exciting people who like airplanes must not miss this clip  congratulations boeing with this successful 787 9 hopefully this year will be a good year for huge orders i am very impressed with the jet fighter steep vertical climb to think that this is a commercial aircraft amazing my dream is to fly this plane someday  ooh ah yes oh god i came amazing take off p she is beautiful simply amazing what a beauty d btw first beautiful dihedral wings my favourite wing design  that rocket like takeoff is unreal  vietnamese here  impressive loved the near vertical take off a very sexy video boeing no combat takeoff this year  air shows are useless and dangerous  this is a beautiful plane boeing is my favorite airliner company  yay the dash 9 is awesome what a stunning aircraft  killer take off nice flying and choice of airline i got a question though after lifting off why do you pitch up that high and then let the nose drop again and only then bank it left why not combine pushing down and banking left so that they are one motion then pull again and show off that wing flex d amazing flying from a commercial airline you would think this would be a usaf plane because of these highly skilled pilots  what a take off wow even as an airbus fan i have to admit that this video was very very cool nice shots from the helicopter very well done the 787 is a beauty no question d what a take off wow wow cathay pacific claims they have one of the most modern fleet in the world but after seeing vietnam airlines i think cathay is bluffing vietnam has the a350xwb and 787 9 all cathay has are the 777s and the a330s go vietnam  awesome video boeing great camera angles first one to comment  that is a great looking plane i must say  another great video for another great aircraft keep it up boeing  so cool  every day i fall more in love with aviation thank you boeing for these beautiful u s a boeing  my airbus a 350 transformed to boeing 787 when it heard the soundtrack   0 47 the boeing 787 10 is on ground again  flying together  on takeoff that thing was climbing way too steeply   boeing number 1  does anyone knows what music is this  great aircraft beautiful flying sequence and photography  i want to work with boeing when i grow up anyway i 10 yrs old i have not read all the comments maybe it is been explained already but is wake turbulence no longer an issue how can the fly behind one another so close illusion i think they are simply gorgeous  so beautiful  i want to see the behind the scenes of how they shot the aerial footage  i have always thought the nose of the 787 looked pretty old school like the comet or caravelle but in a good way  way to go boeing way to go i like the music nicely done  impressive display of technology and operational capacity the colossi of the air are undoubtedly these boeing aircraft i hope they take into account the latin american market to develop these models and market them in large quantities the territory is suitable for domestic and regional flights doubts we are waiting for your incursion greetings most beautiful thing i have ever seen is the 787 10 gonna have two pairs of 2 wheels or 3 wheels like the b777 nvm 0 17  the 787 is a wonderful plane flew one from honolulu to sydney over 10 hours very comfortable but the 737 is far too cramped for more than a 3 hour flight in economy  very nice  can not wait to see the b787 10 in singapore airlines livery  awesome  if emotion sells airplanes then boeing should show this video to every prospective buyer magical   i swear i have watched this video at least a hundred times sometimes over and over back to back between the cinematography and the music it is truly mesmerizing  beutiful amazing air craft boeing  1 20 though just pass me the kleenex i love you 737 is 737 a baby  wtf when they both took off they flared up sooo much i love boeing 737   1 18 how epic is that scene there  the dreamliner is massive  it would be amazing to see the most recent model of each boeing plane in formation from the 707 all the way up to the 787 and everything in between  wow  you guys must do it again same music same airplanes but include the legendary 747 and 5 minutes at least  commercial dogfights lol  0 11 jesus look at the size different i can imagine the proximity alarms in both planes hahaha amazing  the mama bird is teaching her baby how to fly while looking awesome d absolutely stunning awesome  this vid is like father like son in the future the engine will become so powerful that will feel like to be on a jet fighter amazing future ahead of us we have this video is good that was one of the best videos i have ever watched amazing and beautiful filming  a rare sight of a mother teaching its child how to fly congrats beoing  the most beatiful flight of boeing  108 deslike by airbus boeing majestic off  can not wait to see new b777x with revolutionary design of wing which can fold or unfold the winglet according to the flight situation  very nice what drone did you use  hi boeing the 747 is my personal favorite aircraft god bless boeing long may she shine  i will attrmpt stunt i have my private boeing 787 rc plane ha ha ha pretty hey boeing im sitting here watching various of your vids and its the night of july 1 sat so all sorts of fireworks are going off in town boom boom pow bagn and it is providing quite an exceptional backdrop to your videos  music   i felt like i was watching national geographic observing boeing planes in the wild the mama boeing 787 10 taking her baby boeing 737 max 9 on it is first flight cool video  oh god i love that background music  wait i know that planes have advanced tech so that create little air disturbance but still i feel like have such a small plane fly right behind such a large plane also being so close to each other is a little teeny tiny bit how do i put this dangerous  beautiful what is the background music   1 19 is the best scene i have ever seen from your displays uh which is which  what is the song absolutely astounding and beautiful  boeing planes look so elegant and carefully designed  they are the mercedes of the sky d i vote for 787 best airliner of all time boeing is the best  do all the boeing is together 707 717 727 737 747 757 767 777 and 787 that would be amazing to have the entire boeing family flying together  its like father and son aw  i relly loved this video i have seen it like a hundred times that would be great to watch the behind scene a seriously sexy jet the b787 what a beauty   wow  excellent max to the max  goodness that 787 is big compared i was considering flying my 737 very close to united is 787 8 but i too read the caption do not attempt they know us pilots rats  this reminded me of a whale and her calf travelling through the sea intimate care showing the young one the ways of the world only instead of whales these are dragons  awesome video great views  well done to everyone behind this video  awesome job guys and gals one of the most impressive ads for aircraft yet the dreamliner is the most comfortable aircraft i have flown in  oh awesome really it was dramatic display by boeing 787 and 737 max9  love these   its perfect so beautiful  mommy whale n lil peasant whale lol awe some  good shoot wow this is great what scenes  beautiful birds wonderful spectacular from south korea they look like living animals not non living machines beautiful machines i was shocked at the rate of climb at takeoff like a rocket  737 nose looks like a car  engineering excellence it is boeing  sad that it is not real what an astonishing and amazing video  the 787 has the most beautiful wings of modern day airliners it is like seeing big mama blue whale swimming with its calf in big blue ocean  the 787 10 is incredibly sleek  stunning  just the sheer beauty of these aircrafts is amazing  i would like to buy both jets amazing video  dreamliner best plane in the world what a production with this amazing and beatiful machines when i imagine a company working for an industry at peak perfection boeing is what comes to my mind  how do they pull up so hard vertically  must be very difficult to precision fly passenger jets i wish the 777x was there too   do not attempt hold my beer let me open fsx that is beautiful  somehow feels like game of thrones stunning no words for that  one of the best videos i have seen fight on  absolutely gorgeous  beautiful this video was taken by a drone   do not attempt hey bro get your 737 and ill get my 787 and lets perform some low altitude aerobatic stunts  a they look like brothers flying together    1 31 this reminds of game of thrones when the little dragons to try to keep up with drogon the big dragon 787 10  tcas is getting nervous  when i saw the size difference i be like dafaq brother and sister p how about dogfight demo  great but that overly dramatic music takes some of the appeal  boing i am a big fan of yours one day i hope to get my airinotical degree and come work for you also this summer i am going to visit you for my birthday wow great 787 is so much bigger than 737 amazing and why the take off of both planes is so steep  almost like a mother daughter outing now and forever if it ai not boeing i ai not going  stunning  spectacular choreography  music takes the video to whole new level airbus your move  do not attempt why i want to fly my 787 10 next to my neighbour is 737 9  when did commercial planes become this majestic father and son  very beautiful one of the best aircraft in the world congratulations boeing on your success this needs a making of video to showcase the crew is flying the jets and the teams flying filming  whether you are a fan of boeing or airbus this is just stunning where can i buy this  why just why it is only 2 minutes long this video should have at least 10 minutes very goob job boeing  if there were 777 x and 747 8 it would be great airbus how are you going compete against that  such an awesome video beautiful aircraft flying with beautiful scenery in the background  you with me son  yes pop  ok let is show em what we can do  wow just wow the ultimate high  real beuty    i love boeing awesome suck it airbus  imgur was here death to 9gag we are loving this very cool video can not wait to add some 737 max and 787 dreamliner aircraft to our fleet   do not attempt lol i pray to god that i get a boeing internship 3 degrees in aviation and counting  spectacular video and wish my dad was still here to see it he was a boeing engineer who worked on 727 737 and 747 in 60s 70s miss hearing his boeing stories thank you for sharing  i just imagine tcas going crazy i am an airbus fan but that was truly amazing wonder what the other aircraft that filmed this stunt  now that is some awesome photography and imagery not to say some incredible flying fantastic video  looks like a mother whale with her baby d thats some fighter jet stuff right there  the 10 looks sexy natural efficient wow i thought only airbus does these formation flights this is awesome add the 748i amp the 773er   magnificent   do not attempt ugh i was just about to get the 787 10 from my backyard beautiful  in an alternate scenario 737 we got a lock on him 787 oh shoot get him off my tail 737 request permission to engage 787 hard left hard right  fantastic  so majestic i want to cry boeing  a is not that cute a mommy plane and a baby plane out for a flight  lol i like how the 737 just pops in at random times stealing the shot  currently in university declared biology major for pre medicine however i love planes so much more wise people what should i do  i absolutely love commericial aviation and only dream of flying one day but if i go into medicine i doubt that i would ever have such opportunity thank you in advance  i am not fond of the 737 on any flight longer than 4 hours its just too small my last trip on one was from anchorage to honolulu and back it was over 6 hours of cramped misery and buffeting  that is an unbelievable amount of torque required to pull up that fast  most planes would stall and not pull it nice  do not attempt ok boeing guess im not gonna fly my 787 10 and 737 max 9 in formation through the swiss alps  super parejo made his dream come true in seattle boeing lovers loveboeing787 boeingcareers youtu be hobuwtyo7he click here  so beautiful  boeing your amazing  amazing it would be great to see all the footage that is not shown in this video  simply beautiful  can you do a 787 family air show like this one and a 787 10 air show and a 737 family air show and 737 max 9 beautiful video  i need a soundtrack of this music  look at the a380 plus  one of the most beautiful videos i have ever seen on youtube the skill and the power are overwhelming  if it ai not boeing i ai not going  only thing missing was a 747 8i and 777 300er i like to them fly at nellis air show lv  mother bird and her son  awesome thanks boeing by the this video so beautiful that it hurts  watching these two fly gracefully and with the sick camera angles really wants to make me say out loud holy balls  as i see on dislikes here was 22 airbus fun  i am surprised that wake turbulence was not an issue  like father and son two beautiful aircraft right there  this is such a love story  go boeing  this is by far the best video production i have seen from boeing media group kudos  ls this like follow your dad to work day cool video tho  beautiful  why do they take off so vertical like that  seems dangerous 787 10 is the most beautiful dreamliner i love it  that climbing after take off breathless i love boeing  that boeing 787 look sleek af tbh a really beautiful plane   do not attempt lol i was about to go to my garage and fire up one of my personal 787 s good thing you warned me boeing  look at that wing flex of the 787 that is why it is a bow wing   china will make planes like these  any chance this channel can give me the name of that song  that is orgasmic  this is what real ariplanes are real designs not cheap copies of what others make today thank you boeing for proving who knows about commercial airplanes  15 thumbs down from airbus employees  this is the best video that i ever seen from boeing where is the camera during all this  interested to know what the chase plane was  apparently there are 15 people watching who work for airbus  that was beautiful boeing clearly the world is greatest aircraft manufacturer nothing more beautiful than seeing a boeing in flight  your planes are the best can you plz make the 777x faster i love the  who does not dream to be at a high altitude in a metal full of kerosen that explodes and burns like a crisp if easily damaged lt 3  787 10 who else is in love with this beauty  wanna fly on this beast that was sick  amazing this is why i love boeing so much  just cool great flying and the cinematography was fantastic and i promise i will not try this  a i r b u s d nice birds  contest duplicate this commercial in p3d or fsx  show off your work  delightful video it shows all the beauty of physics and the geniuses working at boeing made my day   do not attempt  lawyers pf  the music  two most beautiful aircrafts flying together great job in the video looks amazing boeing is boeing the perfection the leader in aerospace in the world  porn for plane nerds  a father and son moment  this is heartwarming this is better than watching p0rnhub  wonderful thank you boeing for this emotion   two orcas mama swimming with her calf  excellent work boeing  what song is this cuz its amazing amazing ad btw  i like this d  imagine if it was a teaser of next gen flight simulator 2025 gameplay akuenno  amazing  the 737 max the 787 10 the soon or already pride and joy along with the 747 and it is various versions the prides and joy of the boeing fleet i believed in you boeing you came through awesome designs awesome employees and engineers who work their butts off to achieve comfort and payment to passengers pilots and cabin crew along with safety and sturdiness to not only make passengers comfortable but to keep them safe  i did it with my max last week lol beautiful shots of two beauties if it ain t boeing i ain t going precision flying of those boeing pilots flying skills at its best  goosebumps   amazing opening shot was majestic and scary face to face with airborne plane great video good job from france i love the flyby at 1 41  just a normal day with mom and daughter easily a 45 degree ascent rate and the piloting i would fly with either of these guys in a heartbeat        amazing        it is wonderful to see a parent and child flying through the sky i love both 787 and 737  beautiful  it is like seeing a whale and her baby following each other very cool video  where is the fuel tank on this plane middle body or both wing dammnnnn boeing back at it again with the vertical takeoffs d boeing gt airbus it is not a good boeing demo without a vertical takeoff   bank angle bank angle  gg i was the 737 these aircraft are beautiful and the video was incredible congratulations to boeing  i want to buy one  the mother and the daughter of the skies  the eu can t do this not without gov dollardollar go boeing  boeing is best plane b747 8i boeing is worst plane ever made the b787 dream burner pos beautiful flying beautiful but orders sucks well really beautiful but some shots looked unnatural and edited or if it is just me  boeing coming to an airliner near you this fall  i just want to come to boeing and fly the simulator please  the vertical takeoffs though  wow  just amazing truly no one beat the americans when it comes to communication  beautiful display i remember seeing both these types when i visited the factories a few weeks ago  these are some skillful pilots let me try a few of these stunts with my toy planes  sweet juice  10 dislikes must be airbus fans right  splended tho i never realized 787 was that bigger than it  that is pretty darn cool i love all the mountains around  what is the background music  this is why when i hear airbus or boeing i am always saying boeing  do not attempt i do not follow no rules just you wait till i take my 787 out of my garage beautiful  hey boeing can you add a few more shots and make a two hour long version thanks yeah that guys know how to make awesom videos  name of the song please what is the name of the musik  what a video amazing aircraft lt 3 amazinggggggggggg and thats how i lost my virginity like a parent and kid  awesome  wonderful machines  beautiful birds  magnificent i can not wait we get our max 8 is in october really looking forward to the new engines cockpit has it already been 20 years since the 700 800 came out  that moment when you realize boeing test pilots have balls of steel  boeing aircraft awesome  superbe video  i love these near vertical take offs  we are going ballistic mav 787 10 beauty gotta love that do not attempt warning at the end  hat to all the test pilots of the displayed two models it was well performed  splendid at it best both these birds are a class of their own having flown myself the b737s family i have nothing more to add except to admire the aeronautical engineering that has gone into these models of planes just as did many of the boeing generation of manufactured aircraft wonderful display  wow  incredible engineering  i love it  that 787 just looks f  amazing well i would like to see you guys flying the 777 300er 747 8 787 and 737 max together that would be amazing   so beautiful wtmsb i never realized that the 787 was so much bigger than the 737  i like the do not attempt disclaimer at the end was there a possibility of someone trying this with their own personal 787 10 and 737 max 9  b o e i n g  it is like big sister and little sister  absolutely magical like two master figure skaters lt 3 wow  love the piloting editing and cinematography guess it was wolfe air shot that on a side note i would prefer to watch 747 8 777 9x 787 10 and max 10 fly together that would be quite a sight to watch those ultra long airliners with high aspect ration wings flying together  when you ask your friend if you want to do formation flying but they come in an airliner so you have to also come in one  wow  beautiful  nice damn thats some beautiful shots absolute and immensely beautiful all the congratulations and waiting for other similar beauty thanks for telling me not to attempt this boeing i will be sure not to take my dreamliner and fly it right next to the newest 737 we want to see an electric jet boeing  i am so proud to work for the boeing company god bless boeing   awesome as we observe the wild 787 raising her young 737 max out in the wild ladies and gentlemen this is very rare hardly ever caught on footage  wow beautiful flying machines flown by spectacular pilots amazing  what an awesome video of awesome aircraft in flight  is the dash 10 going to have the same hot weather departure limitations that previous versions have  this is the best video i have ever seen literally  very awesome boeing outstanding  well done boeing  powerful such an awesome video they both look majestic in the sky is  the boeing company an absolutely amazing company if you are an employee or share holder then consider yourself blessed and fortunate  great work boeing  some excellent steel birds beautiful beautiful eh boeing has copied airbus is aircraft formation too when did boeing start doing formations with their planes 787 and 737 have nothing in common like airbus is are they should not fly together the video looks so fake too other than that nice  what designs refined to near perfection they are stunningly beautiful  i saw you guys on flightradar24 today  who disliked this video first  airbus goodboeing great absolute beauty the 787 10 looks more proportional than i thought  i want to see the behind the scenes video or making of video for this as everything that had to go into the making of this video must have been extraordinary  100percent one of the best aviation videos on youtube i love close up shots of planes  simply beautiful beautiful  beauty and the beast  do not attempt someone at boeing has a sense of humor  jesus christ man to see these two flagships fly in formation like fighter jets has made my god dam day thank you boeing thank you for your service and i salute you  wow that was beautiful  teamboeing lt 3 very impressive camerawork excellent choice of background too if boeing had taken the effort to remove the unnecessary dorsal fin from the vertical stabilizer and give the vertical stabilizer the same rounded top as on the 787 the family resemblance would have been even closer  clean formations from the pilots and a beautifully produced video from airborne very glad i subbed  the disclaimer at the end lt 3 do not worry boeing i wont attempt  perfect first wow  whichever team designed the 787 wings they clearly knew how to make something efficient and good looking at the same time  pretty steep take off or camera trick or a bit of both  when they took off they look like they were almost vertical  amazing to watch d crazy skill  a work of art  there are not any comments here  and this is not cgi  amazin absolutely brilliant i hope to fly or operate one of these amazing aircraft one day truly top of the line ingenuity awesome best and most beautifull aircraft out there a320 and a350 are no match for these  beautiful  only thing that would have made this better is if the music was a tad quieter do not get me wrong great choice of music for this but would be nice to hear the engines a bit more as well  beautiful american made beautiful video they said do not attempt ok     sweet from an airbus fan i solute boeing for their amazing ads such as this one and the b737 max think max ad simply brilliant wish it was 4k lt gt  presidents come and go the world will always look up and respect boeing  you guys should do the whole lineup  first simply remarkable truly beautiful  wooooooow so who is recording all this great so cool wow if it aint boeing i aint going will there ever be a 737 max10 i like boeing 737max sky is the limit also the 737 is a dwarf compared to the 787 d hora great planes  stunning videography of engineering marvels   big airbus fan who the fu k have disliked this  absolutely astonishing footage  wow so beautiful loving both aircrafts alot boeing  awesome   first jezz that is amazing this just wants me to be one of your test pilots myself i am 11 so flight is just an amazing thing to me uaaaaau amazing images  awesome the 787 10 is one of the most elegant aircraft i have ever seen  wow so cool i do not know which one i like more excellent the future profits for the company such a beautiful dancing pair in the sky  like father like son do it again when 777x flies  absolutely beautiful  so beautiful  that is amazing that was amazing thanks for the real footage  boeing the best for sure the dreamliner is the most beautiful plane ever   is this strictly speaking safe it is too cool though so i suppose that does not really matter  i saw this this morning i think on flight radar 24  keep going good boeing the most beautiful planes on the earth wow  wow some pretty amazing shots the shot in the first few seconds in particular was very cool just need to get a 777x and a 747 8i in there now  wow  imagine passangers on a vertical take off  first  insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  omg i can not wait to seee the 777x fly sooo badly whoa so good  big bro and small bro   do not attempt 2 02 lol omg wow what magnificent aircraft the best aircraft showcase video i have ever seen a stunning video for two very stunning airliners bravo boeing  absolutely amazing  when i grew up i will be pilot  wow thats amazing thats why i love boeing also that plane is huge i m an airbus guy but boy you guys know how to make a promotional video  that was just beautiful  how did you get the camera shots i love you boeing that is awesome beautiful and impressive  simply beautiful machines  there is a reason why there is no dislikes i was first one here do not talk to me or my son ever again this is too beautiful for words brilliantly done  beautiful  awesome   appreciate the scale comparison  two the most beautiful and awesome planes fly together that is the best video ever  beautiful  i want a passanger oxygen mask d dear boeing company do yo want to give me one ddd gorgeously shot video of the two planes  would be awesome if they lined up all of the series together great  nice to see the 737 still truckin after all these years  a dream  why not try make a 797 that vertical take off tho just beautiful  best video of boeing i have ever seen  cool you see this kids this is the future wow  is there no engine turbulence or something i wish i could be this famous pulling in 232 likes in the first 20 seconds of posting a video amazing  wow amazzzzzzzzzing    wow beautiful just amazing go boeing  dramatic display  first comment great video keep up the good work  preperations for paris air show  boeing 787 is very big   the mother and her son wow i am speechless that is beautiful boeing is amazing  beautiful i love those cowlings  son where ever the light louches is ours want one of each to do the same d how does the 737 max differ from the current 737s  amazing job boeing brings a smile to my face seeing an all american company flying proudly in the skies   the 787 is just beautiful in fact the most beautiful plane i have ever seen stunning footage  amazing  a breathtaking  when you see your friend flying a 787 or 737 737 max and dreamliner are awesome  that is just epic  boeing you have done it again amazing  can not wait to fly in a 777 x wow i hope to fly someday a boeing 737 747 or 787  wow dats very nice wow boeing 737 787 nice jet lol  0 11 the 787 is pretty big dislike it is from an airbus employee what beautiful planes this is absolutely beautiful lt 3 the best airplanes of the world 737 max with 787 10 wings would look so nice the best video ever  yeeeee i have chills  beautiful video and beautiful aircraft only one operator flies the 737 max as of now right  beautiful i love boeing  it is very nice please guys get me a subscribe boeing is the best first i needyout help beoing is this video inspired by the airbus formation awesome i love the boring 787 and 737 max the 60 minute nebula version is here part two will launch on youtube in the next week   to recoup cost as fast as possible it was essential that boeing reduce the cost of production i e less bolts so whats everyone is take on the whistleblower   26 45  this video aged like milk  just saw aj jazeera documentary on the insane engineering of 787 scary i think this guy put more effort into this video than boeing have done with their new fleet of planes  amuricans trying hard replying to every comment to save their dying company pathetic state of affairs  nobody should buy american boeing planes any more because they are not very safe  boeing coming to a city street near you or on you stay safe stay airbus  what now  kinda ironic you said insane engineering lmao it is this insane engineering that caused them series of failures and accidents lmaoo tell us you are a high school dropout without telling us you are a high school dropout did they really talk about connor and poirier in here lol nice nice glad to know mma making random appearances the government should intervene to save this giant company great video inside the cockpit flying guidelines demystified   who else is here after the whistle blower the manner purpose of this video and what is says is on a primary school level the type of video a 12 year old would be forced to watch at least once a week must not forget journalists of course probably the video is target audience one piece of advice cut out the superlatives and concentrate on the now this plane is already considered a flop this v deo aged as good as milk unfortunately boeing is in a very dificult place i hope they can pull themselves out of this mess it is named the 787 dreamliner because you must be dreaming if you think you will make it to your destination me in 2024 so is it really a good idea to remove the copper and caps from the wings based on boeings recomendation lol  how ironic  amazing video inside the cockpit flying guidelines demystified   great work the 787 is very cool no doubt and i just flew on one 3 days ago  but what happens if it does sustain damage to its fuselage like a tail strike for example i would imagine that it would be a lot harder to repair this body it aged like milk flew on one from newark to delhi so quiet and comfortable it was fun watching the wings flex boeing did a great job   28 20 bruh  even their engineers did not give a f ck to their hired job in boeing   the 787 battery insane engineering   how funny i have just watched a 9 years old documentary exposing the litany of errors from this very same aircraft it makes me wonder did boeing paid for this  glad to see a cameo from the 94th fts at usafa the gliders i think i have flown in saber 2 2at  as a former air force aircraft mechanic i would not fly on a 787 for any money in the world unless i had a death wish i would definitely not fly on any aircraft manufactured or assembled by non union workers or any company that self regulates do not believe me a little research only takes a few minutes  i would not flying this fire hazard this along with she 737 max  junk the 737 is so advanced that it no longer requires door plug screws  i flew on the 787 the higher air pressure i did not notice a difference compared to an aluminum plane in terms of feeding tired even the noise levels were the same as any other plane  imagine how sick it would be if boeing re engineered a 737 successor from the ground up like they did with this plane and then the illusion burst and everybody saw boeing without cloth on profit profit 787 in not bleedless engine intake anti ice use bleed air from the compressor needs a remake yet   15 58 ahhh laminar flow like shit how many ads was that there is one particular minor issue with the 787 as a passenger the overhead cabin bins rattle around like crazy on the takeoff run and when landing when i was a nervous flyer i really didnt like that and even when i fly today i am surprised how noisy those things are  this was always my thinking on 3d printing structural metal parts if you cannot realistically improve sintering in large part because of the huge parts and low production volume then rough it with fdm and cnc the final shape that said find it strange that boing airbus ge pratt amp whitney rolls royce and lockheed or a subset of these has not banded together to create their own vertical integration titanium industry  this did not age well all sorts of problems coming up now in production of just this aircraft and many others not insane enough  honestly and with all due respect you are wrong i have flown the a380 long haul globally amp i have flown the 787 amp it does not benefit me at all in fact its downgraded the quality of my travel the a380 is far superior in terms of comfort leg room quietness smoothness it allows airlines to deliver better service 787 has uncomfortable seats was noisy amp bumpy i am sticking with a380 for another 20 years thanks  you mentioned that common lightning strikes cause holes in a carbon fibre fuselage yet mentioned no solution to this the 787 sounds very dangerous to me  primary method a human relieves stomach gas is burping not fa ing unless you have had a fundoplication so to avoid fa ing i would avoid that procedure and if you are a candidate go for the linx placement and burp when needed like normal linx for gerd has been in use since 2012  787 is the most uncomfortable plane i have ever flown on even an easy jet 737 was more comfortable 787 is so cramped when flying economy  i love every instance of revolutionary boeing tech being researched by nasa spicy considering boeing kept bombardier is c series out of the market because of government intervention  aged like milk  this is just crazy engineering i applaud all the engineers including scholars who are relentless in research and design thinking to come up with such innovations  nasa seems to have gotten things backwards because they made the airframe of the space shuttle out of aluminium but the leading edges from carbon composite made by engineers who just attended online classes   lol and still no safety for the people when something goes wrong just crashes and all are dead where is the safety like passengers upper roof removes from the plane and propeled people away and lands with big parachute like we live in stone age safety is priority for people damn globalists  i for one do not trust boeing anymore and that is sad  youtube recommending me this is savage but thay couldnt make door well  i wonder how they gonna repair this unibody plane when some mad utility driver hits the plane scrap it i guess right  i am only here for the ufc puns they are becoming more and more like birds flexing and adapting in real time just awesome  i have flown in all boeing models except 747 757  and all the airbus as well my best from the lot is a350 it is better than 787 this video did not age well  why does he say but like that he is all like bouught  go boeing go  and the mentally insane 737 max total crap  4 years of issues and production does not seem too insane seems incompetent great video a couple of small precisions the main role of the spars is not to resist the bending but rather the shear while bending is mostly resisted by the skin of the wing box the reason of higher flexibility is also and mainly geometrical a thinner wing box generates a higher wing deflection real engineering tip your wings if boeing is holding you hostage and forcing you to make this video hold onto your doors   18 18  kindly make a detailed video about airbus a350 development and manufacturing process from the windecker eagle to the 787 what a ride i was at the everett factory when they were putting together the first 787 they were having some fitting troubles at the time that is the one they rolled out for display on july 8 2007 7 8 07 i was working on the dreamlifter the 747 that transported major components across two oceans the 787 fuselage was made in italy and flew in the dreamlifter out of trattaglia the wings came from japan and were flown out of nagoya the dreamlifter major modifications were done by egat in taipei taiwan it was hot and humid there for sure sorry but your description of deicing is incorrect in part no airplane can deice its own wings on the ground as shown with the hot type i fluid most likely being applied to the top of the wing surface ice is usually removed with hot type i then another coat of type iv fluid is applied if needed in really bad weather it is not always type iv but this is an example type iv has non newtonian properties that help keep it on the wing until a certain airspeed is reached after which it will flow away and off the wing leading edge anti ice devices built into the airplane leading edges are only used in flight as that is where ice accretes from impact of ice or supercooled water droplets suspended in the relative wind   3 20 fun seeing parts i have installed show up on a yt recommend video as a pilot of 787 hat off to you guys keep it up  never ever watch a video with insane in the title   the lower pressure would reduce your oxygen intake and your stomach will bloat as the air inside is higher pressure than the outside how then does increasing the pressure even more reduce bloating did they mean to say the air inside is lower pressure than the air outside  great video i love the fact that you used an mma reference but i gotta say i hate dustin poirier  i got the idea of the body lift action from the x 37 which prevents pitching downwards pitching downwards causes instability and weakens the structure of the aircraft the boeing 737 does not have this body lift action and the structure would weaken the structure of the boeing 737 and would eventually be responsible for accidents the cockpit of the boeing 787 i got the idea from the space shuttle for better view for the pilots  and all this to sit in a 3 together seat like a freaking 737  incredible video made extremely interesting and full of information really well done  aluminiumumumum the way brits say aluminum cracks me up everytime is that the same material that the subway that blew up that was peaking at the titanic this year   22 01 dude this plane is so amazing almost ruined boeing because their fuck up on getting the 787 out lead to the max great job boeing  thank you  so insane it will never make boeing a dime too bad boeing did not get the max issues solved a long time ago  the irish thing  great content and well narrated thanks  5 30 10 10 27 00 27 55  once again private companies abusing public funding and research to further their own private goals hoarding it for themselves the ufc references caught me off guard lmao epic video  grant it i mean face it the dreamliner has literally revolutionized the aircraft industry however i also know that the a330 both the ceo and neo are withiut a doubt an excellent aircraft if it were me i would place an order for the a330 over the dreamliner absolutely  every so often i remember the shot you take at connor mcgregor starting at 6 27 and come back to watch this video and your delivery of it it brings me much joy  as an amt that works on 787 is all the time this video was still very entertaining to watch great job  yea but now airbus 350 flys further and efficiently and cost to buy one is cheaper than 787 i do not want carbon fiber nonsense and i do not want my wing changing shape  feels like things are getting cheaper and cheaper unfortunately  insane yep it is too many flaws like its produced by chinese companies  a lot of italian engineering in this airplane the original fusolage concept and engineering was made in italy by alenia  this was truly an amazing watch i still am fascinated by the idea of flight and this heightened it further all the thought and imagination that has gone into creating planes it is insanely amazing i am by no means an engineer but have always been enthusiastic about learning how things work this video blew my mind  carbon fiber planes have been a bit of a flop it is just not a great material for the logistical challenges of airlines it is easy to damage and hard to repair and maintain lightning turns it into swiss cheese and direct contact with any metal other than pretry much titanium can cause galvanic corrosion i do not expect we will see any new clean sheet composit airlines for several more decades  i know this is an oversimplification but the fact that we paint these things into existence is so interesting anyone else hear a repeating click  wait changes to benefit us the passengers did the major carriers remove every other row of seats or something start including snacks and beverages in the ticket price kidding they do not give a good squirt about us as long as we pay and behave  emirates is getting their airbus a380 the plane built by the greed of wallstreet  and what is the flammability of the what are the combustion products produced when it burns  some how this channel is highly connected to the mma community lol which is  hearing a mcgregor and poirier joke in an engineering video was so awesome but unexpected  awesome video wind tunnel tech production planner production operations configuration management commercial amp military acft nasa noaa satellites and still going  problem with carbon fiber is the force is can sustain while still returning to its default form afterwards carbon fiber tends to become weaker over time compared to traditional metals  awesome video enjoyed every moments of it very informative video b 787 is truly an engineering marvel  so much said about the everything in 787 what happened to the aircraft one it started its service in different airlines around the world how many cases of crash occurred in the early days of its career batteries some program flaws some design flaws i am not a professional in the field of aero to list the flaws finally a plane that is specifically designed to reduce farting 5 35  delamination  the insane hiding of all the fatal design flaws and bribing the faa   note to self 15 32 aeroelastic tailoring  god jesus     it is compooooosirte materials  it is immensely beautiful and impressive i just cannot get over the mcas debacle so negligent that i struggle to trust boeing  i was a structural engineer at boeing and worked on the development of 787 for almost a decade and this video was very accurate well done  mcgregor caught a stray the sly mcgregor dig was crazy  15 15 all those delicate curves ah i see another planesexual lol love the mma analogies there was no check  lmao the mcgregor slander please pronounce aluminum correctly  one of them will end up like that carbon fiber sub one day how are they going to repair the carbon fiber fuselage if it gets damaged  can jews fly in this airplane  i just got to fly in one of these was nice as nice as economy class can get loved the dimmable windows i love ur videos nothing else to say i just absolutely love it  my grandpa worked on the 787 love it wow look super jumbos can come back requirements for such largely dramatically lower costs per passenger per flight such that if it is flying only say 200 300 people or so it still outcompetes things like the 787 777 767 737 and the airbus a340 a320 is and probably some other ab options i am not as aware of meaning we are most likely to see super jumbos in the form of the blended wing form and likely those will come in seating options of 300 600 likely mostly because i think their will be a cargo use for something the size of a 600 seat range so they might as well design a passenger cabin for it too but not test it till some company is seriously asking for it so we might see some very busy routes with two of more flights at very similar times say leaving within an hour of each other condensed into one flight and plane but most of flights are now point to point and no longer spoke and hub so these massive planes would probably be reserved for long haul flights between huge population centers say eastern us to europe in theory also the pilot shortage might imply a push towards largely planes and fewer flights because there are not enough people to fly more flights but that is a very hypothetical proposition another alternative is they just charge more per seat till fewer people choose to fly  so if they went through all that work what happened with 737max  im here for a college research paper thank you very much for this excellent video youre a reference in my paper for sure  i can even get a flight from san antonio to florida or chicago directly  this is a genuine question cause something i am not sure about would it not be possible to cnc normally then collect the metal scraps and melt them down and reuse them  what i do not understand is the problem with machining titanium it was presented as if chips from production is a waste like you know as if machine shops did not collect all the chips and send it off to be melted down into ingots again  this video makes you think all waste from machining is just garbage wrong wrong wrong i have been machining for a while not a pro or anything but know that just about every machine shop iv e been in had some of chip management system that always collected chips made from production and selling them back to the foundry or they melt it down themselves  in the future please include standard measurement along with the metric for the american audience the metric measure is incorrect  the downside of a unitary fuselage is the difficulty on repairing any damage that does occur if you have riveted panels you can remove and replace individual panels  spectacular engineering and science communicator  i am hbk jr hello buddy remember me the woman are gonna go crazy over this boy   do not let the heart break kid return for a show for the box offices it will be sold out arenas shout out to the women who said i was cute but travis was a creep   my needs were less footspace they killed off big planes with lots of footspace for smaller planes with less footspace  i am just an auto tech but i have a sudden urge to buy a 787 now  nothing in this technology pass the 1980 achieves this was great i am taking a long flight from jfk to france and wanted to know more about the airliner taking me on my trip  engineering is an amazing profession and i love it it is great to see how we can apply knowledge and skills to build and create useful things it is so exciting to learn new techniques and to develop new ideas that bring about solutions to important problems as an engineer myself i am proud to be part of this amazing field it is really inspiring to be able to contribute to our understanding and development of the world around us i love engineering  while the engineering is just astonishing i just need to talk about how gorgeous the 787 is so beautiful it makes you want to cry the epitome of grace and subtle aesthetics i have studied aviation history for the past 17 years and there are few airliners that have ever existed that can even come close to holding a candle to it in my opinion maybe i am just a weirdo who is loved aviation for most of my life and therefore gets emotional about these glorious machines but i will never stop being in awe of the sheer perfection that is the 787 battery issues and all  if you want to look at insane engineeringat 1 29 you need to look i watched one of your videos once and i can not stop to me these are better than long documentaries 1 subscriber ahhh not carbon fiber im telling you it doesnt last engineering at its best  26 18 these are not the only safety features removed boeing also removed some of the insulation inside the wing as well as safety features inside the fuel tank this is part of why the faa is engineers objected to the approval of this change the other being of course the recent 737 max crashes and the faa is lax oversight of that plane is design  there is only one conor mcgregor  thanks  god i still wanna fly on one of these so bad as well as the 777 for a second time i would even like the a350 the bet paid off really that aged well  boeing is such an amazing company the 737 max was such a stupid debacle that it must be very frustrating for those boeing people who were not involved please make a video about airbus a350 900 1000  real plane crash clip here gt    i loved this video thank you so much  i prefer the a350 but it is newer as well so it kinda evens out i wonder how these planes would hold up in an emergency crash based on what i have seen in the automotive industry from porsche and lamborghini i would think everyone would die nearly every time carbon fiber has great tensile strength and awful shear and torsional strength if i had to guess the only crash landing that would go smoothly might be a landing gear failure i barely trust planes the way it is i will never ride this talk about a death trap i will take as many layovers and farts that want to come my way to be a few percentages safer you also did not note that carbon fiber is destroyed and left brittle by uv radiation leaving the plane to need constant inspections and possibly a lack of capability to fix the plane is this actually a good thing to me the best part about these is the aeroelastic tailoring boeing needs to stop jumping the gun they keep messing up big time and are going to kill people in the name of profit  carbon fiber may be great for airplanes but not so great for deep water submersibles  aluminum  please add paypal option to nebula i am locked out from it because i do not have a credit card  pity boeing is having these assembled by low rent methed up underpaid non union un skilled poorly trained help in south carolin who are leaving a random built in array of structural problems that can not be found or fixed no way i am flying one ofd these and the folks on the sc assembly line say they will not either  well as a general member of the public just browsing through interesting documentaries this is up there with the most fascinating i have come across i know nothing about the technology used on 787 is but am drawn into how the current future of cost saving air travel is developing we are all aware that battery powered planes are being researched at the moment as well but making planes run so much more efficiently on fuel is still an important perogative of air travel design surely these documentaries are brilliant thank you for these uploads   0 55 the price of tickets are not cheaper unless theyre regionals but the costs are higher due to the increasing fuel costs ahh composite materials we meet again  looking at ana 110 outside the lounge rn one of my favorite planes of all time  carbon fibrea is not what it is cracked up to be is not it  the 787 is like a diesel automobile they are very fuel efficient but high in maintenance costs when a 787 breaks it breaks hard   4 01  a masterpiece of a video thank you awesome work as always keep it up thank you for keeping us informed on different things god bless you  if the dreamliner is made of 50percent composite materials then half of it at least is not recyclable so much for protecting nature from destruction  yea this shit aint safe there is basically no way to track damage happening to the inner structure of the plane im talking bout those said fibers snapping inside over time weakening the overall structure up until it all snaps unlike metal those fibers do not take it well when you try to stretch em which means that the whole deal is gonna require frequent maintenance metal on the other hand is a well known and reliable material its behavior can be easily predicted and any damage can be detected and repaired   exacturbates shine   6 27 bruh  from 0 40 to 1 05 as a canadian these advancements have not benefitted canadian travel whatsoever our airfare rates are the highest on the planet by a lot  we have 2 major carriers that monopolize the skies and set ridiculous price points all while getting bailed out by the federal government every 5 6 years it seems the local airport authorities charge airlines ridiculous money to use their terminals  dreamliner is appropriately named smooth quiet well done on klm my flights on the b787 10 jfk ams dxb were fabulous service was spectacular vegan options were adequate seat k9 was perfect not so perfect was k1 even a business class 180 seat can be too close to the bathrooms and front galley i wonder which airline provides the best premium economy experience in the 787 10 9 amp 8  thank you so much for this amasinggggg video boeing purchased mcdonnell douglas because they can at the time steal their wing design  carbon fiber is not looking so good right now thanks to oceangate i remember when the 787 was first announced i knew right away it was gonna be a thing of alien technology airbus a350 is better headless screws have been used for decades someone talking about engineering should have known that  why can not the metal shavings be recycled  boeing winning i study accountancy but do love aerospace aeronatical engineering   i do like flying the dreamliner on microsoft flight simulator  excellent video nicely produced  should have subscribed earlier but just did because of that mcgregor porier comment  titanium from russia with   united airlines loves this video  very very good and nice videos i thank you and your team for that   pure geniuses at boeing and only boeing america is the best  it just does not matter i watched so many air crash videos in the last couple of years i will never get on a plane again i do not know if i should be mad or glad  in my research i found that aluminum 7085 is used but now i am just even more confused because welding 7xxx aluminum invites stress corrosion and microcracks  nvm i worked it out 7085 aluminium alloy is used for its inclusion of up to 8percent zinc which when paired with magnesium and copper allows the alloy to be precipitation hardened assisting to retard dislocations within the metal furthermore inclusions of chromium improve corrosion resistance and help limit the stress corrosion that is often associated with welding zinc alloys zirconium is also added in order to inhibit recrystallisation this prevents the growth of new defect free grains allowing the alloy to maintain its desirable hardness and strength characteristics finally titanium inclusions are used to refine the primary aluminium grains this increases the number of grain boundaries resulting in a more ductile material controlling the grain size in this way also assists with corrosion resistance as having too many grain boundaries promotes galvanic corrosion while coarse grains do not provide enough space or pathways for ions to travel through making it difficult to develop a uniform passive film thus reducing corrosion resistance  might be a good aircraft but only if you disregard tools ladder and rags left after assembly as well as lousy build quality and finally boeing putting disregard passenger safety after profit  they fucking patented fully metal fff 3d printing 787 is crap with all sorts of quality control issues i will never fly any recent boeing  thanks for the fart joke there simply are not enough of those  watching these stoned people are amazing what they have created  booked a flight to paris from chicago i can quite assure you the prices for this trip have not gotten cheaper but quite a bit more expensive  is not there a potential risk for boeing aircraft  properly enjoyed that and wish tv companies were brave enough to make such succinct and informative documentaries people are more interested in facts and details than they think  did boeing really take a bet though they received billions in gov funding specifically for the 787 and would surely be bailed out if they were to fail doubly so since they are a gov contractor hats off to the incredible engineers but let is keep in context boeing is historical lackluster leadership yes we all receive the huge benefit of the 787 if we fly but we also paid dollar4 billion plus in just illegal subsidies read illegal according to the wto i am really not convinced boeing has to risk anything at all at this point more like ignore the problem til it starts killing people as we saw in their recent history  less farting   millions of dollars   all new technology   ah  progress  the 787 is probably the only plane i would trust going on a trip with can you please do the engineering video of airbus a350  i love engineering if engineering was a girl i would marry her  what a pleasure to watch and even just listen to this video  no more racial hustle for making a stopover at an airport in the us b787 can fly directly to destinations from isolated japan without a stopover in the us and canada and avoid russian airspace this is a huge improvement for the japanese the worst flight was from mexico city to tokyo by b767 they needed to refuel at an airport in the us due to the westerly but by the regulation while refueling at an airport in the us all passengers must disembark the plane and there is no international area in airports in the us where passengers just sit and wait until refueling is over and all disembarking passengers must go through passport control thus many japanese and mexicans get denied entry as usual and then detained in jail they can never get their destination they get deported back to mexico no wonder why japanese ana supported the development of 787 it is indeed a dream liner releasing them from racial harassment in the us  i have the intension to study engineering this video help me to study hard  this is why i love aviation imagine when they will develop new technology for engines which would be better jet engines  i worked in this factory as the 787 began production i was a mechanic on the 777 at the time a fabulous place to work  in my opinion the a 350 is the better aircraft but the 787 has the most beautiful wing design since concorde especially when viewed from the front or behind those achingly beautiful curved wings are so elegant and they are probably the biggest giveaway when plane spotting  click to copy related topics trending news federal aviation administration business faa says leaky faucets are a safety problem on boeing 787s does anyone know why the b787 is nose points downwards for example the 777 is nose is just slightly below the center of the body whereas the 787s nose is almost at the bottom of the plane body mcgregors catching strays in this one  10 50 the vortex turns to the wrong side on the right wing  i really appreciate the numbered references they are awesome you can fall down a hour long rabbit hole i started watching this video at like 19 10 and im not even half through at 20 18  respect  honestly the 787 is goddamn beautiful i mean it is the peak of what humanity is currently capable of and we are capable of creating some beautiful stuff when we really want and need to  long time watcher first time subscriber because youre dumping ufc facts yes boeing has made a big bet but on a bluff they are building a plane designed and being produced by the bean counters not through careless research and engineering lke they did in their heyday why else are they still having issues getting this plane produced in any numbers worth mentioning  one reason gaps around the forward pressure bulkhead which in the days of old would never have happened   i loved this aircraft because of its wings so i watched this video now i love this aircraft because of its wings  the accent is intolerable  0 17 flock of olanes nesting great video thank you though machining creates alot of waste material you can melt it down and reuse it i believe machining is a better product  oil and water do not mix just put organic coconut oil on wings to prevent ice most chemicals have a negative effect on material and finishes  is there a video of the insane engineering of the boeing 737 max the killer  all of this effort into building a superb aircraft and the airlines still managed to find a way to cram 9 abreast and make it the least comfortable international aircraft in the sky  i am one of those mourners i think i have traveled through a380 once perhaps twice and 787 a few times a380 is miles ahead of 787 in comfort  former 87 quality inspector here the aircraft really is a technological marvel not just in the materials but also in the technology used to manufacture this wonder the tech we used to build and inspect this aircraft are years ahead of what most other aviation manufacturing companies have at their disposal it really was a privilege to be a part of it  so this is where the sound on tiktok comes from i never thought an engineering video would lead me to learn why i used to get terrible stomach aches and gas when flying on older aircraft but not on newer variants  made in the usa by americans for the world to enjoy and copy a350  air travel bloat i know it well two lactose reinforced lattes before boarding and i sprung a continuous leak from new york to paris 8 hours of pffffffffffffffffff  this is a waste climate change will end the world in like 7 8 years now  i ai not benefiting i ai not flying so you know let it all end  just read today that the faa is increasing attention to what boing is doing such a complicated machine can become complex without a safety vision in mind  i would crap if the plane i was on was going damn near straight up gggg 4645 it is insane how much thought and complexity actually goes into building something like an airplane i always assumed it was just a very smart computer landing gear sensors wings control surfaces an airframe and a couple engines hearing about all of the materials and new technologies that add complexity was super interesting   5 37 what is firting  what i just watched i will sum up in a single word amazing  what engineering this plane was just taken out  cheaper airfare when did you record this 1962  how many hours can flight 787 10 without refuelling   7 33 you use countersunk flush head rivets on the skin not protruding fasteners not sure how much less parasitic drag being composite reduce because you paint either metal or composite airplanes  that is so awesome you should talk about the insane engineering of the mcas system on the 737 max and how it killed 346 passengers  have they not tried having tuberculosis along the wings like how whales have that decrease drag  i am irish and a bit of an engineering and aviation geek myself and i have no idea how i have never came across your channel until now love the narration and the references to various random things great videos and you have got a new subscriber  i think i would rather fly airbus especially after the 737max issues that got brushed under the carpet the old ceo did not just resign for nothing  i am really concerned about the safety of 787 but a direct flight from warsaw to tokyo is impressive  my mind is blown yeah it is my most favorite airliner especially the 9   confusing a380 wingtips wont hurt you a380 wingtips 0 22  finally  let is not forget delamination problems as well as challenges for the long term maintenance it is nice to higlight the advantages in new generation aircraft and there are many but excluding the downsides makes this seem like a commercial  too bad they did not build redundancy into mcas i flew japan airline is 787 economy class it was the best way for trans pacific flights period   29 27 is not the a350 the most efficient long range jet ever made  shame about the terrible paint problems on the wing upper surfaces we had to try and fix and the cabin quality is poor and many plastic components break so easily not maintenance friendly in some ways but it is in others   26 42 this is concerning what if the nitrogen system fails  just wow great explanation crystal clear  it aluminun brilliant program  titanium is used also because ti has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to carbon fiber much better than al also the 787 hydraulic system is 5000 psi as opposed to 3000 psi on most other aerospace programs this pressure necessitates ti for hydraulic tubing  that mcgregor line was outta pocket this all garbage how long 787 will work max 20 years b52 already 100 years in air now b52 will replace 8 engine by 4 and another 50 years in air carbon fiber garbage that moment when you are watching this while waiting for a 787 learning about composites in my first semester and watching a video about it and understanding the terms and process makes me so excited  wow how do people figure this shit out amazing  the 787 is a gorgeous airliner but if you are flying us domestic it is gonna be an a320 or a b737 every time you gotta go overseas to get on a 787 or it is like an mia dfw flight where aa is moving an aircraft into position  apparently it did not it was a disaster took this plane with air canada from toronto to japan and wow it was such a smooth ride looking forward to taking it again  excellent video like how you did not mention all the shady buisness boeing got involved with with the lies of the 737 this is a company puff piece done by a company man tons of statements about boeing in this video are flat out wrong the airbus has been the most selling plane since 2014 why act like boeing is good and not bring up the shady faa buisness they got caught paying off the faa meanwhile planes are falling out of the sky i will never fly boeing again airbus ftw this plane just looks so freaking boring though the 747 was gorgeous lol that is not mt olympus it is the brothers in the olympic mountain range mt olympus is at the center of the range and not visible from the seattle viewpoint of the shot just sayin  some dude during development alright guys listen  what if we add little suction pumps on the wing the rest of the team wait what  at 2 00 you actually arent correct the a350 while being similar in materials composition and having similar innovations to the 787 is not intended to compete with the 787 the a350 is too big for airlines to consider buying it instead of the 787 the a350 is intended to replace the 777 200 and 300 ers the a330neo is airbuses answer to the 787  if you asked me today what plane i would want to fly from la to tokyo on it would be the 787  the way you say composite makes me want to scream absolutely fascinating engineering will keep amazing us just imagine planes 100 years from now  anyone who flies in a boeing aircraft needs their head examined the greatest technology in the hands of people beholden only to profit and shareholders becomes a coffin  what is the purpose of the small drogue chute trailing behind the vertical stabilizer that shows in many pictures of the plane  i do not know why but i just find this plane to be so sexy i still have my first picture of it when i first rode in it  insane engineering more like insane cutting corners by knowingly assembling non conformed parts  its just a merciless  this was extremely well done although i must admit i chuckled every time he said al loo men eee um 5 syllables instead of ah loo men um  very cool great video thanks  it paid off sorry but no some 20 billion over budget was meant to be cheap to develop and cheap to build which is an absolute nonsense brought by the max people unlikely to ever make a profit according to several industry analysts we do not know yet how those planes will fare once they enter d check with that never tried before fuselage material not even made by boeing  nice video and all the details are appreciated though in a time where humanity struggles with climate change not even addressing the fact that carbon fibre is not recyclable seems just wrong to me also after the max desaster which was caused by money saving measures it is nice to hear that they again saved money on the security side love it just makes me avoid these airplanes even more airbus all the way  i really do not think that the engineers that designed the 757 were insane  has china stolen the technolgy yet  hmmm that is funny i think the 787 is very very very sane  super cool i am a fa looking forward to telling my passengers some of this information  which is surpassed by the engineering of the a350 captiva8ing 787 was the first plane i ever flew from stockholm arlanda to fort lauderdale miami excellent presentation nadeation there is no mount olympus in washington wow i work 20 ft from the autoclave they are pushing the nose into well lets throw in a adcp ii just for coolness then u really really got somthin i engineered the boeing 787 dreamliner i engineered the 787 with body lift action which i got the idea from x 37 as well as perfecting carbon nanotubes on my first year of university cbu the cockpit from space shuttle  why not create a gap between the outer and inner layer of the 787 wing and put a thin layer of carbon fiber fabric because you say its a great conductor i think the hlfc system has been eliminated from the 787 9 the hlfc doors are present on the vertical stabilizer but not on the horizontal stabilizer  i came for the video i liked and subscribed because of the ufc references lol what a pleasant surprise  i flew in my first dreamliner in 2015 aus to dubai and i was shocked at how smooth the flight went i have felt worse after flying around the country thats a toyota prius of sky mate great idea but a typical boeing boondoggle the best part about the boondoggle portion it kept me employed in their high lift department for a good 10 years or more right on through the great recession the 9 has a lot of the 8 teething problems resolved wish they would do an update of the 8 although i am not sure about market demand  looking forward to flying on one of these from honolulu to dallas on christmas day  they could use lighting strike carbon fiber cf with copper wire woven in the mesh in select places to dissipate the electrical surges  woah i did not know someone had developed fdm with metal filament that is amazing  love this stuff watch formula 1 their wings and chassis designs are filled with carbon fibers arranged in layers that optimize stresses ans flexing for their benefit  a350 clear does not have to be salt water any liquid can be an electrolyte interesting that cf causes corrosion  rivet is wrong they are countersunk not round head it is not the 1930s  what is keerban foiber   26 42 here they go again  wow wow good brother tnx good business ok thanks good i am a second year aerospace student working for my bachelor is degree boi o boi i finally know where and how what i have learned is applied i am glad i found this channel  the guy can not pronounce the named materials properly driving me to shut down the video  incredible channel so many interesting details brilliant video so informative thank you well done  changing the weave to get the compliance and flexibility where you want it but stiffness and strength where you need it is something they do in carbon fiber bike frames too  love the ufc references in the video xd ufc fan  came here for the 787 stayed for the science what exactly is insane about the engineering that term when applied to advanced and ingenious design is a complete oxymoron  thanks amazing video  i am listening to this video whilst looking at an 787 i am about to board amazing subject fine modeling great work they should do the insane engineering of the boeing 737 max do not think removing trusted bleed air is a good thing any way great video  insane  excellent explanation of the a350 in and out   the price of your tickets are cheaper than ever no they are very not  btw the a350 was actually meant to compete with the 777 fantastic video i intuitively knew that the 787 was special but now i feel like i know the aircraft i am proud of boeing is engineers their incredible partners and intelligent executives  boeing 787 looks like airbus a350 the a350 it is not an aluminum plane does the 787 have the lord is prayer printed on the sick bag like the max does  in light of some of the cost saving but life endangering measures implemented on the 737max i can not say i am jumping for joy and the never 787 builds especially where lightning strikes and galvanic corrosion are concerned  cheaper flights in late 2022 lol lol  love this plane but hate the airlines packed the seats so tightly together older generation 777 had more legroom on average  as a worker in the aviation industry this plane is the most hated to work on at my job haha but it is beautiful and a work of art well tickets are not getting cheaper at least for me  i do not know but i felt too much wishes gonna to kiosk and buy a 787 plane  saludos from  it is very interesting this video  thank  it is aluminum not aluminium three syllables not four  my dad briefly worked for 6ish months wiring the 787 is in sc he had been sent from his hangers employer to go help them for business when help was asked my younger sister and i were lucky enough to go visit him the very weekend the hanger was having family day my mom would go up every once in a while and stay with him so the tickets were saved up so my sister and i could go up with our mom to visit therefore i knew i recognized the assembly hangers especially the big one i bought a blanket from the hanger gift shop with a snow flake designed out of 6 planes embroidered on it i have been never been more proud of my dad  i am not going to claim the dreamliner does not have it is place in modern aviation however the workhorses of the industry and especially of the de hub ification are the 737 and lately more importantly the a320 family  at the center the what tell me you are a murrican without telling me you are a murrican  titanium is lightweight and stronger than aluminum but also self healing quickly forming an oxide layer if abraded it is defiinitely used in the engine mounts  the 787 might have some amazing engineering but the klm 787 800 we were on from salt lake city to amsterdam had the worst engineered and most uncomfortable seats l have encountered flimsy non ergonomic creaked like an old boat in a storm and for me and my wife almost impossible to get to recline properly if anyone were to lean on the seat back rest to get out of the window seat all 3 seats would move and flex god awful shite  if it is boeing iam not going a poorly built death trap boeing the aircraft company that pioneered sacking qualified aircraft builders to employ unqualified labour instead some of whom were crack heads it was a great plan until they fell out of the sky because of physics the behemoths will return the model of mass aviation currently is based on a massive and explicit government subsidy of an industry that would otherwise not exist there is also an implicit subsidy in the form of a lack of meaningful carbon pricing of aviation free pollution free negative externalities the behemoths and a hub model are more efficient modes of allocating the energy budget of mass transport and probably must return if we hope to have a safe and durable future  it is wrong to say aircraft must fly below their critical mach number in fact airliners routinely cruise above mcrit the speed to be avoided is the drag divergence mach number mdd and is typically 5 to 10percent higher the limiting speed is maximum mach mmo where the adverse effects of compressibility are deemed unacceptable that if anything is the speed aircraft must fly below  boeing are rightly getting a lot of criticism for 737 max and starliner but the 787 is a properly ground breaking aircraft and wonderful to fly in its a shame because if they would just bit the bullet and designed a new 737 replacement from the ground up basically a baby 787 it would absolutely crush anything else in the market surely  mcgregor burns  hopefully those 3d printed parts were annealed lol every year this plane crashes killing 100 200 most dangerous plane to trevel in boeing is shit this is a great video however i would call it insane after looking at the avionics prespective of the 787 because that is what actually makes it an insane marvel of engineering please add that to make it even more impactful and informative  the voice of the reporter and his accent is horrible video is perfect but his voice is just destroyed this video why not use graphite instead of aluminum or titanium  no its not  your explanation of how composite material is made also explains why spacex changed from using composite material for stainless steel when building the starship spacex would never have been able to make such fast changes to the ship is design as a new mold would have been required with every change  the narrator  droop control of parallel inverters  9 5 tons heavier then projected or anticipated insane engineering stratocruser no ups it is too much let is downplay project and call it dreamliner from glorious company boeing became a joke with some very well paid morons  what humans can do always amazing  hopefully not falling from the sky like the 737 we need the insane engineering of the a 350  cerbon ferber is very strong  if this airplane is so well built then why do over 50percent of workers at boeing say that they would not fly or let their families fly on it i mean you would think they would be proud of building it but that just is not the case over 1500 parts initially did not fit a lot of times the parts were made to fit this is true and easy to fact check i am sorry but i think you are leaving out some important information regarding the build quality and the politics that are unfortunately tied to this airplane  less farting   favourate plane why does this plonker start talking about ufc   watches video to procrastinate from analysing stress strain curves the video  nice mma jokes could you do another video on the airbus a350 and compare it to the 787 as well as the problems both carbon fiber planes are facing  that 787 flies like a light weight paper airplane  halleyuah sophisticated technology to create a co2 producing monster that is bound to become extinct  also make a video on a350  all the hardware in the composite structure of the v 22 osprey is titanium  no no new trends are not to benefit passengers they are designed for the airlines to get more money  please do a the insane engineering of the 737max video   hummmmm if airlines decide to have fewer staff and assets alike then welcome back to hub and spoke air travel cattle cars  and turboprops  cool  honestly more efficient  incredible video everything is explained so perfectly  there should be a follow up video to this the insane decisions of boeng and the 787 it could discuss the theocraticals of design vs the real world performance and the difficulties of making concepts reality it could include a discussion of engineering vs executive decision making like what happens when a manufacturer fires 900 quality inspectors or why deliver planes with known defects that could lead to structural failure to its customers the outcome of instituting mandates that forbid hiring of experienced aircraft assemblers to keep labor costs down  i hear you laughting when reading the part about less farting  the a350 is not a rival for the 787 it is a rival for the 777x a rival for the 787 is the a330 neo just take a look at the purposes and passenger capacities great series of videos but the titles are not up to the same standard insane is completely inappropriate and there are so many more suitable adjectives in the english language  and this is why the 787 is the greatest amazing video thanks  cool and all but after the acars failure this plane was a flop and the proof is the stagnant price share on the nyse  dat mcgregor refrence just try to avoid flying on a 787 that was assembled in charleston sc by uneducated failed burger flippers high school dropouts drug addicts drunks and incompetent southern rednecks  ok well done as a retired aerospace engineer i am impressed with the content of this video  787 is the biggest failure in the industry is it even fixed yet  so fun fact most large fibreglass and plastic composites are made completely by hand i like to bring this up whenever someone talks about how automation will just make industry obsolete completely forgetting that some parts are so complex it would be impossible to design a mold that could properly move the resin and impossible to design a machine to do manual layup there will always be people with little rollers and a spray gun making sure there are not any bubbles   i love the us aviation program it is really impressive  it is a well engineered plane  hell yeah murica outstanding engineering video  absolutely amazing  thx 4 sharing this man does not match clinton sleaze or the goofiness of the other boy president younger bush he is just an unprincipled america is poodle  for heavens sake get rid of the windows and use cameras and flat pannel displays  this plane is so good at being a plane it is a miracle it is not the only plane flying anymore  i miss the unique three and 4 hole jets  the f 4 phantom has thousands of pin holes in their wing which bleed air from the engines were pumped to control the boundary layer of the airflow over the wing glad to see this technology being used  i have watched this now 7 times  if the engineering is truly insane then the plane is not airworthy language use is getting more stupid or perhaps i should say insane by the day  how am i benefiting from this change being cramped into a tiny seat for hours with hardly any room to move is not really a benefit economy on all planes is torture if you are taller than 5 10  amazing video  its kinda cience and advertising  this video is so damn good ive watched it at least 10 times now great video  mt olympus maybe you meant to say mt olympia  hahahahaha  so i was in boeing everett on a saturday and a sunday for structural inspections on the steel frame used for empenage static load tests on the 1st prototype 787  both tool tethers and netting were used to protect the plane from ironworker tools and bolts if accidentally dropped heathrow airport egll has cancelled 1 2 million slots going back on their word up until end of october 2022 i recognise this u turn and half truths embolden lies from elsewhere i wonder where this emanates from  as a mcboeing 3rd generation mechanic and having worked the 787 line from 1 i will not insult people that operate on another reality i myself would not fly on one even after my cremation for a flight home completely my dollar0 02 enjoy the ride  thanks  boeing would have so much more credibility if it was not for the 737 scandal  annoying voice  now i see why aeronautical engineering requires top notch students the level of intelligence and knowledge required is so high as a very soon to be computer engineer this fascinates me so but so much  compared to an airbus 350 these are no where near as good from the perspective of a passenger  cancelled flights by airlines refusal to pay staff what they were paid prior to covid tax payer bailouts 100 is of thousands of last minute holliday cancilled fuck the airlines  this is ridiculous the sheer amount of thought and enginering they put into this plane is crazy love the wings of the 787  so they have to inject nitrogen into the fuel tanks every time the plane is refuelled  excellent as an aerospace engineer military i did not know about the super critical wing logical for civil more fuel storage  the insane engineering of a flying coffin   why does not the 787 have winglets all modern jetliners do  i feel the need to say that norsk titanium is literally norwegian titanium and sounds weird when you just say norsk because the grammar sounds wrong i am guessing this is just a typical bilingual problem but great video nonetheless  great engineering but i am not sure about the decision to remove copper mesh and insulation caps for the lightning  trash company he is pronouncing aluminum incorrectly  what an amazing plane bruh great video but who tf is dustin pereer  inspired by your videos and getting amazed everytime to see so much complexity that is involved in creating this engg marvel i am pursuing master is in aerospace engg thanks a lot to you  i remember reading that the 787 was apparently the first commercial aircraft to stop using hot bleed air from the engines to heat the cabin air which on planes like the 757 was shown to be the cause of long term neurological damage and even fatal accidents for air crew cabin staff and passengers because of toxic burnt engine oil leaking into the cabin air is that true does the 787 really have a separate system isolated from the engines for heating the cabin air  the cessna citation 3 was the first airplane with a supercritical wing to be certified by the faa back in 1982 proven on a modified f 8 crusader it was certified to 51 000 feet which is almost 20 000 feet higher than most airliners and business jets typically cruise the cusp at the rear underside was designed to eliminate the mach tuck where the nose pitches down as you approach the speed of sound this is what killed a lot of p 38 pilots who impacted terra firma when they found themselves in an uncontrollable dive which requires slowing down to recover as your dive becomes ever steeper the first production model owned by golfer arnold palmer set time to altitude aircraft records of 12 min 1 s to 12 000 m 39 350 ft and 23 min 43 s to 15 000 m 49 200 ft and an airspeed record from gander airport to paris le bourget in 5 h 13 min averaging 429 kn production continued for nine years until 1992 cruise speed is 472 knots with the mmo or max mach operating comes at 491 knots and mach 851 also even general aviation airplanes have been built with twisted wings since the 40 is the idea is to have the wing stall at the root first so as to allow aileron effectiveness before entering the full stall as it migrates outward with continuing increase in angle of attack  that is all great but i will never forget the terrible tragedy that boeing in the interests of profit killed hundreds by implementing a poorly designed stall correction system relying on a single sensor in the 737 max boeing knew it was bad but they pushed it through we should never forget profits before people is plain criminal  jumbo can accommodate 430only not 600 is a350 not a carbon composite plane  this is awesome i never knew that i thought it was just better on fuel wait so can they patch damage caused by like birds or something carbon fiber is not very good with high impact strength and they can not use a big metal patch like they do for metal fuselages  the 787 is so bad that many boeing employees will not fly on it much like the 737 max boeing is heading the same way as mcdonnel douglas douglas covered up faults on the dc 6 they made changes to the dc 8 which made it dangerous and then the dc 10 disaster  what do you bet china already stealing this tech tickets are cheaper which planet are you living in   0 48 my favorite airport oslo gardermoen  oh sure two engine cross ocean planes are benefitting consumers nothing like running out of running engines when you are 3000 miles from land it is about saving money for the airlines not about benefitting the passengers  what if babies are truly in pain in conventional pain explaining why they cry all throughout flights usually they start crying around both take offs and landings  hus opening statement certainly is not true today with all the pilot and employee shortages it is almost impossible to travel right now by airline  so the hull of the 787 is basically 3d printed using carbon fiber filament tape on a non planar head what is so insane about it  annoying number of mid roll ads sooner or later china will take over americans do you all think i can vaporize one of these planes with kerosene jet fuel let me know your genius thoughts lol real engineering ha 911 inside job note the video of boeing c level exec saying they would not fly in that unsafe 787 piece of junk designed to be cheaper to build but no repair possible  wait 787 max a flying coffin   this is so good can not find word to describe how good this is  certain countries caused the current political crisis that now abound through feelings of the right to manipulate countries without actuality going to war however these efforts have been stymied and colonial power has been contained and supporters of those colonialists have been put under financial and moral pressure forcing unsupportable and foolish threats  it will not have the desired effect on russia because nato countries have alienated certain countries for some time now and they have made protections for themselves that has hardened them against the activities of nato countries thus causing frustrations and protestations from india and causing great embarrassment to the nato governments  in 10 years we are going to see these things falling out of the sky due to cutting costs on the titanium cost cutting always leads to tragedy  fantastic workmanship used to make this video very well done real engineering  this was always my thinking on 3d printing structural metal parts if you cannot realistically improve sintering in large part because of the huge parts and low production volume then rough it with fdm and cnc the final shape that said find it strange that boing airbus ge pratt amp whitney rolls royce and lockheed or a subset of these has not banded together to create their own vertical integration titanium industry  great engineering but it does not change the fact that it is too narrow for the number of seats per row that most airlines install so hip room sucks  the revolution starred by airbus long back  mma comparison for the win i use to be a huge boeing fan until the absorbedly large amount of deaths they cause with the 737 max deaths racking up dollar2 5b in legal fees and causing 300 deaths now im totally airbus fan i just feel more relaxed when im high up there  he did not have to go that hard on mcgregor lol the a350 was made to rival the b777 not the b787 what about fire on board  the rivets caught my attention i would have thought that the aluminum was welded and the rivets i see on airliners was to tack laminar sheets  soooo they use titanium mig wire to make parts thats what i got out of it  it is aluminum not aluminum in the states i can not get a direct flight anywhere in the 70s we flew from miami to sacramento straight or one stop in dallas now you must travel slower lower and go to chicago or some other stupid hub  this was built on a schedule that swapped quality for profits i would never trust this plane listen to those in the industry that know all about this plane and boeings downhill fall towards corporate control over engineering integrity  that is not mt olympus  the same company that hide the fault about mcas no thanks  i am sure boeing approves of this message no mention of li ion battery fires and only time will tell how these new plastic airplanes hold up did he say the wings normally flex 3 meters almost 10 feet and in testing 7 6 meters almost 25 feet and constantly deform and reform during flight i think i am getting air sick  i was just in the 787 today it is mind blowing i have begun disliking and blocking accounts that use words like insane or amazing or similar hyperbole in their titles and i do not watch the video  what a detailed and interesting take subscribed  wow i am flying on a 787 tommorow so i thought i would watch this video this is the most information i have taken in in half an hour all year  just flew on this plane a couple days ago for the first time smooooth flight loved it nice report but due to corona and few employees the prices for a ticket are more expensive and it looks like you are waiting in front of an amusement park and the planes have become bigger but we also pay with our more expensive holiday if its boeing i am not flying  ah yes never realized that one benefit of the carbon fibre fuselage would be less er gas from the passenger sitting next to me d definitely worth the investment  how do you pronounce aluminum  one innocent question why can not they put emergency parachutes or other self landing devices in case of engine failure we would rather need more safety than saving money on fuels and making planes lighter and cheaper besides being super interesting this video did a great job explaining principles of aerodynamics as a pilot in training i found it unexpectedly helpful thanks  the only change i will appreciate is a drop in airfares  irritating voice a a former manufacturing engineer for the 787 i am impressed with this video  its just amazing something that heavy can get up off the ground that is some serious power i used to be afraid to fly but knowing how they can fly on one engine and seeing how some on fire they still land safely yer it paid of but lets not say about all the lives that took in the persuit of profit  flying to aruba on the 787 soon great video mister real engineering stop your dammm channel please goddammmit you are giving away american technology secrets to china stooopidd  read before clicking 5 34 i knew they had cleaners but i thought it was for rubbish trash i guess i know the real reason they are there  just wondering what nde for composites will be used during maintenance  just flew one month ago from istanbul to chicago with 787 9 incredible experience i love this dreamliner seeing this thing take off and climb like a fighter jet is just impossible so cool what a beautiful bird and those rolls royce engines  not cheaper than ever obviously your group never flew in the 70s or 80 is  totally unreliable as demonstrated since biden election  carbon fiber is not a green material and creates greenhouse gases whew bullshit as a substitute for truth i may have to at least minor in aerospace engineering now no mention of the bus bars running through the fuselage and wings to carry transients generated by lightning strikes in a metal aircraft these transients currents in thousands of amperes are carried on the surface of the fuselage in the 787 the currents are carried on bus bars running through the bilge under the floor and in the overhead being connected in parallel their combined resistance is very low however the voltage drops over the length of the aircraft and wing tip to wing tip due to the very high current can be hundreds of volts ohm is law associated with the high voltage are electric and induced magnetic fields all electronic equipment and interconnecting cabling were designed not to be affected by these lightning induced fields boeing is test requirements exceeded the faa standards of do160e which was current at the initial stage of development  787 9 cargo opetations at tokyo narita in hd   bingo all hail carbon fibre for reducing farting in airplanes  i do not like flying but  i love the dreamliner especially with rr engines american airframe brit power just like the p51d 787 the mustang of civil airliners regular wings bash thru turbulence the dreamliner surfs one small issue with this video is the fact that the a 350 is also composed primarily of carbon fiber reinforced plastics rather than aluminum the video in and of itself despite that innacuracy is fantastic by far the best video detailing the construction techniques of the 787  i talked to someone who worked on the eurofighter in 2015 he warned how hard they had to work to make the eurofighter is carbon fibre safe against lightning strikes and said then he would worry about the 787  the 787 predecessor is not the 777 i will never fly on a 787 period  despite these boeing sponsored youtube pr gimmicks  the revolutionary exploding battery was a triumph  round headed rivets have not been used in a long time for airplane skins i think it was ww2 when they started using flush mounted or flat headed rivets  why do we texans have to endure these british accent announcers annoying there is another doccie out there on how badly built this aircraft is i will never fly in it  one massive paert  the carban fibers remember caerben faerting i was enjoying this until you mentioned that thug mcgregor  i like your videos and your irish accent should have stayed with an aluminum fuselage would have saved two years of development issues cheaper tickets not sure about that  the airbus a350 is not a direct competitor to the 787 the a350 its much bigger the only thing they have in common is that they have a lot of composite materials  dislike for using those anglo measurements unable to watch it the 2nd worst aircraft from the worst brand  it amazes me you now have aircraft like the a321 and boeing 737 on trains atlantic routes lol appreciate the mma analogy  airbus a350 gt boeing 787 watching this before a long haul flight on a 787 after learning all the painful details of the 737 max fiasco i will never again board a boeing aircraft  mcgregor haha awesome vid me watching a serious video about aviation advancements also me at 3 55  impregnated heh  these videos were not available back when i was graduating insane quality and very well explained without using math keep this thing going pal by a fellow aeronautical engineer greetings from italy  i had the pleasure of flying in two of these as a passenger amazing plane takeoff was so smooth and fast and cruising altitude was fl400 which surprised me  a10 refueling  i appreciate that conor mcgregor joke just so you know congrats i love the 737 max the most it kills people so i do not have to  a350 still better though  when engineers outranked economists the biggest thing i hate on this plane is companies employing the 333 seat layout   insane engineering i am totally put off watching this from the title  please do not try explaining how plastic impregnated with carbon is stronger than aluminium for airplanes to a layman well for cyclists we have come to agreement with this i recently traveled on a 787 dreamliner without any engineering knowledge of the aircraft because of this apart from the size of the windows and their dimming lighting features the thing that struck me the most was that when we landed all the way down the aircraft to the cockpit the entire internal central ceiling spine of the aircraft wobbled violently as the tyres touched the runway and the brakes were applied never seen that before after watching this i guess it is because of the flexibility of the materials used  your voice soothes me as i try to sleep cause i have sleep problems just make sure they do not forget to add the phelange the random shade throw at mcgregor  thank you for all the work you put into making your channel so great it is one of the top channels i have seen produced on youtube  so many inaccuracies here the far superior a350 does not have egg shaped windows for one also no mention of the now infamous 787 issues er like the gaps in the fuselage etc which halted production no new deliveries of the 787 have taken place since may 2021 insane engineering yes insane for relying on too much plastic   airbus has been using carbon fibers for 40 years  after the scandal of boeing 737 max i stay with airbus  can you please make one of these episodes on the a350  who wrote this video script first grade children but but but but but but but but but  is a350 better than 787 i really studyed that and i have seen that a350 haves better cabin is more comfortable and more fuel efficency and bigger cockpit and idk what to say   6 21 was it shot in pattaya thailand  anyone know the name of the piano song being played in the background during the intro for the first 1 min or so  i m b777x is king this shit not  build out of hemp fail if it were actually insane it would not work  no way i will be flying with boeing or let my loved one flying with boeing given the number of crashes  what a fascinating video many thanks for posting   17 09 the northrop grumman yf 23 uses a similar sort of turbulent boundary layer suction system forward of the engine intakes it is visible to the naked eye as a bunch of little holes the raptor and many other jets deal s with this boundary layer problem by engineering a gap between the engine intakes and the fuselage p s the yf 23 should have won   boeing has huge problems delivering these 787s to buyers the faa has hammered them because of safety issues and removed boeings ability to self certify this plane and the 737 max check out the nebula version  perfect video for 3am i had my first plane experience with turkish airlines boeing 787 it was a great plane  you went into details we did not even cover when i was an engineering apprentice at ge aviation relatively recently damn  why no composite except the wing is introduced in 777x  save on gas buy boeing travel in safety style and comfort fly boeing be bold and love boeing dazzling on approach and landing yippeee    how will they get around the thermal expansion paint problems that airbus is having  lmao at the connor mcgregor dig as much as i like that planes are advancing i miss the bigger jets alot more comfortable space wise  thanks  lol f boeing ok their planes kills people yes on paper it was a perfect and amazing plane but the quality and the supply chain failures showed that boeing made too many shortcuts with a cascade of suppliers and sub contractors with a quite poor quality level and even some design flaws appeared when the faa decided to make real and rigorous checks boeing never cared about that aspect and could sell that plane like hot potatoes until the b737 max fiasco made clear that boeing corrupted the faa for the certification of all planes and today the b787 program is costing a fortune to boeing despite high sales a dramaliner the problem is that the b777x seems to be designed in the same way bad bad bad management at boeing even somehow criminal  well it is a beautiful airplane indeed and hopefully it will do well but it was not all this nice at the beginning there was a 60 minutes story about this plane the 787 and how ridiculous its initial construction and introduction was the interim plane was just an empty shell just to demonstrate to reporters and businesses people as it was so behind schedule but when they found out because there was gonna be no demonstration flight it was a bad press boeing was cutting corners everywhere to save money using below pair parts parts that would not pass initial inspection or that would not last as needed were being used anyways etc whistleblowers were being threatened and fired by boeing it was absolutely shameful  is there an example of creating something to be as efficient as possible no matter what the cost or manufacturing difficulty is because if so i would like to see it  you background sound is so irritating and annoying we stopped viewing you video the a350 is not comparable what so ever it is much less fuel efficient and more expensive the use no carbon fiber on their aircrafts which should make them cheaper but in fact they are even more expensive boeing is out selling the airbus 30 to 1  the beginning part of the video drives so much into the fact that the wings are highly flexible but never talked about the performance advantage of having a flexible wing the high amount of flex is actually a byproduct of the property of cfrp material which has better specific strength there is no significan not advantage of using a flexible wing over a more rigid wing aerodynamically speaking in fact there might even be minimal negative impact  love this channel and really respect your knowledge but  there is no such thing as a negative balance sheet i think you meant negative income statement not quite right or negative net income  bro excellent video truly tell me what is the name and composer of the song playing in the background at 25 00 please man i need this  bro i am going on the boeing 787 this summer buts  dreamliner less farting scientifically guaranteed  i have basic concept of fluid mechanic bernoulli is equation i also know the galvanic effect happens between stainless steel amp carbon steel surface all i learn those stuff at university back to 1990s thank you for updating my knowledge on recent airofoil design amp development although i am not practice in this field of engineering also thank you for updating me that even carbon fibre non metal contacts with aluminum metal would also trigger galvanic effect before i just think it only happened between different metal surface  also 3d metal printing was not born at my era now astronauts able to print a glock handgun at international space station even they do not taken one during launching material science and method for making product already out of my traditional understanding and concept thank you for all new information enginner needs constant updating on their technical knowledge gt there are so many change only for 30 years  i do not care if i never see or hear anything about boeing from now on you just go on and on praising boeing is engineering expertise while obviously avoiding the fact that boeing deserves to be barred from doing business after it negligently if not actively caused the deaths of over 300 people on two 737 max airplanes this makes boeing an anathema amongst american corporations  loving the ufc references ahahaha a fantastic video unfortunately the 787 program is experiencing a production moratorium primarily as a result of the disgusting trendss unearthed by the 737 max causing the faa to take a deeper look at boeings production processes if ever there was an example of a company placing a higher value of profit over people look no further than boeing massive means heavy extensive might be a word to use   tell me you wanna have sex with the 787 without telling me you wanna have sex with the 787  isnt that the plane which has so little quality control that staff doesnt want to fly it  small correction at 1 53 the a350 is too big to compete with the 787 it competes with the 777 the competitor of the 787 is the a330neo which is not mostly composite except for its wings  excellent production but could you refrain from using the rather silly description insane in the title  boeing is the pinnacle of aviation like toyota is the pinnacle of automotive  what the fuck is this shit  21 44 this results in a tonne of waste metal as the metal is gradually shaved away how does it result in wasted metal can not the shavings simply be smelted and reused  cheaper than ever i doubt  24 42 my sleep deprived heard lightning strikes a kurd once every 3 000 hours  i thought looks like someone does not have your back anymore i know i am an idiot but in my defense i been up 58 hours  electrolytes is what plants crave amazing video those ufcs reference tho  inspires confidence except for the focus on cost cutting over safety particularly with the lightning protections removed and little explanation as to how a plane shot through with holes from a lightning strike is not a problem  it is pronounced ah lume inum  4 35 you think they cook pizza in that oven    is there a written transcript for this video that we can refer to  i will be flying on my first one this friday  let is go brandon    0 00  yes many advanced solutions but that aircraft has been grounded several times  so is not that great  n  shame it can not be engineered to stay in the sky  u said that the a350 is an aluminium plane but it actually is made of more carbon fiber than the 787 all this stuff is really cool and i know the dreamliner is much better but it still makes me really sad that i probably will not ever fly on a 747 i have flown on the dreamliner and tbh it was kinda lame maybe that was because it was a terrible airline that gave me barely any leg room and the food was terrible but still rip 747 i like how he says kherben fibre  the insane engineering of boeing 737 i wonder what they are saying about the sackler settlement the incredibly generous new sackler settlement v2 0 was changed to provide dollar750 million for the victims of which 149 000 have made claims out of 500 000 deaths caused by the opioid deaths that have occurred in the us albeit others were also involved see cnbc that means that if divided equally each victim is surviving family members would receive just about dollar5000 per death of or injury to their dad mom child or relative when if their court cases had been allowed to be filed against the sacklers juries would have awarded judgments against the sacklers that i opine would have ranged from dollar250 000 per victim to dollar100 000 000 per victim including punitive damages if the sacklers had lost just one lawsuit and been found negligent or to have acted wrongfully as to victims in one lawsuit brought against them then that judgment would have become res judicata as to their negligence etc knowledge etc then later victims could easily get settlements against them by merely citing the final judgment the doctrine of collateral estoppel against the sacklers which would have established the sackler is misconduct via this settlement therefore it is likely that the sacklers saved the rest of their reported dollar11 billion dollar fortune by paying just dollar6 billion thus this corrupt settlement arguably violates the constitution is takings clause because it is misusing government power the bankruptcy court is power as an agent of government to rob the victims who are the survivors of persons who had opioid caused deaths of causes of action against the sacklers worth many many billions from the expected value of jury awards from which those victims could even borrow right now but for the settlement for a paltry sum that may have to be divided among nearly 500 000 claimants however due to whatever the ags and other politicians received none of the states apparently will appeal again to set aside this settlement which is grossly unfair to the victims they rescued defeat from the jaws of victory they now can share beers and laugh and yell to hell with the victims families which must include members of every ethnic racial religious and other group in the usa because opioid addiction has become very common among all groups i bet those ags and politicians that gave the sacklers such a generous deal will receive contributions from the sacklers and their allies for the rest of their lives some may become senators or even presidents insider trading is tiny taking money for giving favors to the ultrarich is where the real money can be made is it not  i do not like 787 is maybe profitable and efficient for airlines but for passengers it is not ideal made purely keeping airlines in mind not passengers smaller plane less leg room   26 42 ah yes boeing is infamous cost saving measures this was the same reason given as to why they did not make re training mandatory the 737 max pilots and then hundreds died because the pilots were not aware of the system that failed or consequently how to disable it  love flying on this modern marvel when you sit looking at the wing at takeoff and flight the wings flex and look like a birds wings this girl just wants to fly   aluminium  the background tune drives me crazy sounds like a boeing broadcast video coz airbus a350 is made of 53percent carbon fibre and the boeing 787 50percent they are absolutely comparable the big difference between both are the engines capacity and range nice video onre remark it is not plastic it is resin resin is not the same as plastic you keep talking about carbin fiber in plastic resin such a thing does not exist  this is great and all but i know now that boeing cuts hella corners in manufacturing so i do not know how good these builds actually are absoloutely in love with this channel i also just had the pleasure of seeing a c17 in taxi and takeoff action when will you make a video on the c17 please do its a marvel  i am a structural engineer and the engineering of the 787 makes my head hurt  amazing video so informative and entertaining the best  nothing like the concorde in 1969 or the airbus dream on  hope expansion and contraction issues are resolved composite at high altitude is still iffy at best peace brother i feel like i am in a university thanks for these flights have gone up astronomically here    as sooo connor mcgregor career cut short because of structural stress on his bone  but he got unbreakable titanium shin bone nowadays so his career will be long an prosper  the 737 max is the one with the insane engineering  i love how there is a documentary just below this on how i would never fly on a 787 by al jazzerer my respect for the boeing company excepting the engineers has plunged rot from the top did their disgraced management allow for careful construction how many candy wrappers and loose fasteners are rattling around in voids is boeing now aerospace is version of wall street is big short  with high prices for fuel the airbus a380 is much more economical for airlines  brilliant narrative content and delivery buy the one from the west coast of the united states of america in the state of washington do not buy the one made in the east coast of the united states in the state of south carolina repeat do not buy the south carolina built boeing 787 dreamliner it will be a source of woe your bankruotcy and buyer is remorse you have been warned  boeing is the best airplanes in the world most reliable n excellent engineering innovations hatts off to boeing co n its engineers n employees   6 28 damn they really had to do mcgreagor like that lmfaooo majoring in aerospace engineering because of this channel great stuff titanium is not expensive the tooling and machining behind it is though  as a materials science engineer i have to applaud you for the accuracy of these videos inelastic vs elastic deformation galvanic corrosion s n curves etc i was not expecting such specific information to be explained in such an accessible and easily digestible format this is my first video i have ever watched from your channel but you have a subscriber for life thank you for all of the work you put into these videos best youtube channel u just summarising my degree in a 30 mins video   and it paid off what no it did not boeing screwed up bad it was a good idea but they managed to screwed it up by making safety second to profit they screwed up  is this video a joke you do know the 787 is still grounded for production and material issues that will cost tens of billions to resolve if indeed there is an acceptable and safe fix to be found a very odd and misleading video given the current status of the aircraft  sure love to discredit boueig myself go on 1970 tech crash again again again oh and sue bombardier for trying betterment boigo 2 forever aircraft manufactures havent used domed rivets in decades really excellent video thank you i did fly the dreamliner once well twice on the return from bos to nrt on jal and it was very uncomfortable but i attribute that to jal friends said i should have taken ana but back then they were only flying it to japan from san on the same 787 flight we were delayed and we did have numerous power problems lights going out etc at the gate pilots came on the pa and said as much but decided to proceed with the flight later we learned about the battery problems the industry should have foreseen this yes lion batteries are great but they were as yet unproven in this application maybe some of your analysis on that would be good or if you did i missed it sorry i thank you for being very thorough much appreciated love your channel  it is crazy to call this plane a bet the needs of airlines have become stable we are not in the 50s and 60s when they would ask for someone to build a plane the plane would take 5 8 years to be buitl by which time they would not want to buy them of course hindsight is 20 20 but at the very least it was a very informed decision for reasons that on display on the growth of companies such as embraer and bombardier  787 is not a competition to the 350 but rather the 330 the 350 is more of a competition to the 777  the more i learn about boeing the less i trust them god bless america  brian produces a really high quality exciting and inspiring piece about the engineering marvels that fascinate him also brian 5 37  how many people got the ufc comments  rip skilled labor mount olympis  too many ads to allow enjoyable viewing your greed cost a subscription  ohh yesterday this jet crashed in china is town all bet in one plane  m8 watch the full vid again and go to 31 04  wright brothers pioneered the use of composites in powered aircraft as well as contra props  great video very clear explanations of some very complicated processes  and yet they have installed radio altimeters which are susceptible to interference from 5g frequencies whoops wow talk about drinking from a firehose  absolutely fantastic how do they test the 150percent of max load thing i am picturing a pilot with balls of absolute titanium but maybe it is done on the ground hopefully  i am an engineer at heart and i really like this channel however i do not like the narration it sounds like it is being read by a robot a robot which does not know how to add intonation to its voice and how to insert correct pausing between clauses and sentences the narration is a flat monotone which is boring to listen to and there is no break between the main subject and other additions such as adverts and channel notes i tell you i could do a much better job of narrating myself  god where is that accent from it drives me crazy just hearing it one of the reasons why i only listen just a minute and then have to go great content man the but word sounds so horrible to me  actually supercritical wings have been standard on airbus planes since the a300 which was actually the first ever produced airbus airbus just keeps embarrassing boeing  this makes me always ask and scratch my head simultaneously sports players do not do shit but throw a ball and entertain but make 100 million dollar contracts these engineers change the way we live this is simply incredible okay i feel like a mental midget after watching this god bless human ingenuity why are we wasting public discourse on pronouns really  the laminar flow system you describe at 18 minutes did not originally ship on the b787 9 aircraft boeing forgot to update the computer system to compensate so airlines were reaching destinations on reserve fuel on the 9 variant is was worth about 500 additional miles in range b787 is marvelous example of modern tech  fun fact everyone else is aspect ratio only goes up to 10 boeing is aspect ratio goes up to 11  i have no idea what half this dude is talking about  and then most airlines made the economy section 9 abrest 3 3 3 configuration rendering them completely uncomfortable for normal sized people had they done 2 4 2 it would have been glorious  currently studying for electrical engineering but aerospace engineering is next  several of these 787 is have had major cracking at the rear bulkhead among several other issues it is a heap of shit aircraft that is lucky to have not had a major incident at this time composite materials are notoriously difficult to recycle though  love the mcgregor and porier reference  the person next to you will not be farting as much unless you are sitting next to me  i remember years ago when the dreamliner was still in development and getting crapped on by the media while felating airbus glad to see they were completely wrong  i should have become an engineer both of my grandfathers were engineers one was apparently chief engineer at ge is pittsfield mass plant in the 1950s and 60s what an exciting time for sure and the other as a highway engineer with a love of railroads i never knew either of them but i have inherited all their books and papers and it makes me feel like i would have really enjoyed something along those lines if only i had applied myself a little better  with reactive carbon fiber tech advancements briskly moving forward wings could eventually come close to mimicking the one capability that birds have over planes that being their ability to dramatically morph in flight the greatest hindering factor is the amount of energy required to obtain the desired shape transformation to maximize efficiency while probably not viable in larger commercial aircraft smaller military craft might be able to take advantage of the capability  but are boeing just going to lie about the computer systems in this plane and let hundreds of people die because of it  if boeing built it it would be insane to fly in it  oh boeing the company that killed 346 people by making a faulty plane the 737 max no thanks i rather drive  boeing cutting costs by removing the thin copper strips unbelievable  absolutely awesome video guys brian what software did you use for the animations in this video thanks  after watching videos on the 737 max and the 787 dream liner problems and the problems with manufacturing plant in st louis this just makes me not want to get into something that definitely has unknown and hidden problems that will not creep up for atleast a decade sound track in 28 40 please it is too bad the airplane is good design but bad workers can screw it up by leaving garbages in fuel tanks and missing clams in wirings in cockpits i will not fly on another boeing aircraft for as long as i live the company is rotten to the core needs to be disbanded   11 39 vortex drag is not the problem here the problem is induced drag which is a byproduct of creating lift over a given span by making a longer wing regardless of it is aspect ratio you have to push each air molecules downward less and because air compression exponentially loses energy to heat a longer span prevents this loss vortex drag is a largely overblown phenomenon that is not really fixed by an aspect ratio rather it is fixed by wingtip shape  i am partial to the flying behemoths the jumbo and the 380 very comfortable even in economy smoother flights with lower response to turbulence and many other positives will miss them as they get phased out  i have confidence in the boeing staff of engineers and designers but unfortunately not of the management which seems much the same so lets pray that no short corners have been taken with unqualified cheap labour because the reports coming out of s carolina are not good  it is indeed a dreamliner i rode it on my way to china from brunei i loved every second i was on it yes even the crying baby took my first 787 flight from philly to dublin and it was phenomenal once you have flown on one all later flight suck i arrived feeling better than i have on flights half the length and fast with the strong tail wind it was over so quick  the parts that do require rivets can use flush rivets to lessen drag  do aircraft weight the same on the ground as they do flying  more or less  i have not seen many 787s in the us though   hi babe  also high on their list was the elimination of the union is benefits to employees to cut costs i had two generations of my family that worked at their plants but without a pension for retirement i made other career choices which i am glad i did since i was saved the reputation of building a plane that unfortunately killed people so recklessly hopefully in time they will get back to the fundamentals that made them a great company  insane is the right word grounded for a year due to technical defects til about aluminum and aluminium  thanks to real engineering i can finish my 5 page essay on the 787 hi mate i am currently writing a paper on the applications of lightweight materials in aeronautics and i was wondering if by any chance you had a reference list for this video it has so much of the information i need but because its not peer reviewed and a youtube video and stuff the reference is not reliable so if by some crazy chance you had a reference list it would be amazing thanks heaps love the content top three favorite youtube channels  6 28 shots fired shots fired i would not be lying that you are making all of us interested in engineering majors plus the quality of the videos is just outstanding and the content is so easy to understand you are truly changing the perspective of looking at things for an ordinary person for instance the next time i travel in a dreamliner i will know that this plane is nothing like a plane 50 years ago meaning being able to appreciate the advancements which have lead aviation to this point can not wait for a video on anti gravity engines lol whenever your able to get your hands on one haha boing the company that only has lies so the carbon fibre will break lol the company that has political connections i will never fly my family in one when the engineering is so extreme it gets grounded for 3 years straight despite boeings assurances the removal of the copper layer and the insulation is worrying esp given boeings track record regarding cost cutting vs safety   hopefully it will not be engineered like the 737 max   5 33 i am that person next to you looking forward to this tech taking over the industry  this plane sounds great but are we still packed like sardines on the inside  with a supercritical airfoil the distance is longest beneath the wing so the lift is always under the wing and the plane can only fly upside down can not argue with logic  3 41 ffs even the 787 can not be manufactured in america  the only problem with the 787 is the ones made in south carolina where employees are prohibited from creating a union they are overworked and underpaid the employees being overworked is leading to poor quality control and airlines are complaining about the quality of the planes the production of the 787 could lead to the downfall of boeing as more airlines have been canceling their orders and switching to airbus due to the quality control issues  this is a very nice v deo with real iformation thanks  great video really learned a lot why using imperial though  incessant music noise is mind numbing does the great content need such over dubbed garbage  great video with clear sound thanks  i really enjoy watching this video but i can not wait until start to travel for the first time i remember aiding in the development of this baby in charleston from alenia to boieng lots of 14 hour shifts in various roles from tech to engineer to planning and root cause talking like this is new technology the fact it took them so long to figure out simple shit like this is kinda dumb  very informative and nicely explained and presented in simple language thank you dollar14 97 yearly is an attractive offer but what does the regular rate become after that year  i have seen and read alot about carbon fiber in aerospace and automotives even worked with it my self on a small scale i still can not get my head around an entire plane made of it i am still of an ancient mindset of plastic is brittle and cracks even though this is not plastic is not brittle and does not crack thankfully i am not an engineer just a dinosaur lol curiosity stream or nebula i am confused buddy  i have no intentions to study engineering but i absolutely love to learn new things thank you for these  is this the one that was crashing due to fucked up software programming in the first 8 months this plane is all electric variable frequency drive generators  this guy has 20 phd is i love his stuff  it is not insane it is science  he is not addressing the fundamental question what is life but rather telling his audience how some people define the term alive which does not necessarily go anyway towards addressing the question what is life  i realise realize you are american but please stop using the word insane in this context thank you yet boeing has not been delivering these aircraft for some 5 months boeing lost its way around 1980 i would not trust any boeing aircraft built after 1980 they are run by the accountants and not engineers just look at the max disasters bean counters rejected the engineering department suggestions  boeing cutting corners in removing copper strips another disaster waiting   11 35 that is falcon stadium sighting at the air force academy in colorado  in your window comparison you say that you are comparing the b787 is window with aluminium airliners but the a350 is more modern and is made up of 2percent more cfrp than the b787 also when i used to work for airbus we used to call the structure in between the wings the wing box the part you show when you talk about the wing box is the main spar both are used as fuel tanks the ing box can be thought of as the central part of the cross that the wings and fuselage form    amazing the 787 is a marvel to fly on the wings bend slightly upwards just like an eagle so comfortable and quiet make all aircraft this way and everyone wins  is this video a joke composites are older then the posters age  insane yes there is been a lot of insanity in the 787 program it has not paid off in any way the r amp d costs of the program and the compensation paid to airlines for late delivery has far outweighed the sales revenue the fasteners have been a disaster the curing of the fuselage rings has been a disaster the supply chain has been a disaster boeing employees have openly criticised the poor quality and lack of safety culture at the production sites when you bet the firm on a radical program it apparently cannot be allowed to fail even if that puts shareholders and passengers at risk when boeing merged with mcdonnel douglas they started having way too many issues the 787 is a horribly engineered and designed aircraft 2nd only to the 737 max boeing cut their own safety standards and protocols just to meet the bottom line the entire development was delayed for 2 years and when they finally rolled on to the runway they were catching on fire due to a lack of research and applications of a poorly designed known flaws li ion battery pack the company that made the chargers tried numerous times to stop the production and when their entire facility burned to the ground in tuscon az boeing just found a new provider for the chargers while keeping the same battery plenty of faa documents citing boeing employees quitting retiring over safety protocols being ignored by higher ups yet boeing just kept on rolling  nice try boeing  need a similar video on a350 xwb please good one shots fired at colin mcgregor xd and yet more insane use of the word insane and incorrectly by an irish fella talking american very impressive and they did not even go into the amenities on the inside of the 787 which are a game changer in themselves  wait a minute wait a minute  even though the carbon fiber is very corrosive towards aluminum they still used it to frame the cockpit windows with a special coating um ok i guess i will be watching to see how that goes on an episode of air crash investigation airline x inspections were not good enough and did not see that the coating had a big chip in it from a hail storm that happened five years ago the name of the game is efficiency efficiency efficiency especially with the global threat of climate change as a retired mechanical engineer i find these videos fascinating thanks  my mind is blown thank you for this work  in the force vs displacement diagram showing the difference between the aluminum alloy and the new composite material indicates that during unloading the composite does not take a permanent set later the speaker seems to infer that this characteristic is used as a matter of course for the 787 i do not think the composite material can repeatedly go into the plastic deformation zone and then return to the elastic strain zone repeatedly without consequence i am a retired mechanical engineer and my experience with composites was during r amp d phases the characteristic mentioned is noteworthy and possibly able to reduce or minimize damage during an over stressed event but i do not think it is a part of any requirements document i think the design requirement is still to stay in the elastic region during all of the verification and durability testing perhaps someone closer to this project could provide a more definite explanation it still is a lot of new territory for boeing to integrate into a production design all at once im sure there are some untold stories that those of us that have been through our own little battles would love to hear good job to the men and women that pulled that program off  what is insane about it the title as an engineer i do not like to be thought of as insane for doing my job  i just recently went on holiday for the first time it was to lithuania i was on a 787 i am really glad to learn more about this amazing plane 787 is ugly af and the 747 and 380 are better in my opinion i assembled the radar dome and cargo door seal fun plane as a sheet metal mechanic it was trip moving to composites much more forgiving and easier to work with  why does all engineering have to be insane can not you find any other word to describe your videos  airbus is the future boing is not going to make it  hello you are wrong the most important issue is the cost of material carbon fibre is too expensive its like making a car out of gold and boasting that this car will never rust nice video but wrong get rid of large airliners and stop the pollution of the atmosphere cars are being blamed for what airliners do look at the meeting in scotland about air pollution and every country came in by airplanes that is very bad and making the people suffer for something they are not doing stop large airplanes being built and the atmosphere will clean itself up  somebody is ufc fan huh i flew on a 787 recently i liked the high ceilings but the plane was very bouncy it did not feel like it was turbulence more like it was flexible and so it wobbled this way and that the whole flight  carbon fiber when cured is stronger than steel and you can manufacture large complex parts so that hugely reduces the need for large quantity of fasteners  so could this place take down a tower like 9 11  where is the gas tanks  so why do some planes aerosol spray the skies  smart example of connor and dusting ahahaha love the video however machine shops recycle all the metal chips none go to waste that irish accent make me angrey  the ufc analogy cracked me up thank you for making this video  i really do not like the video at all it is full of false facts and myths that intro begins with a lie the b789 most sold nightmare liner is always flying to or from hubs it has a lot of hub to n connections it was good marketing by boeing but in fact it is just not true that the b787 is flying point 2 point airbus was actually well ahead in the use of composite materials for example the a380 was the first aircraft with a carbon fiber wing not the 87 that is also why boeing had to outsource a lot to japanese companies who just had more experience the b787 fuselage tons are actually a disadvantage and it is highly likley boeing will change to the airbus approach at the a350 by mounting carbon fiber sheets on an al frame it is very hard to repair damage on a b787 fuselage it is very hard to build and handle on these large pieces and it is hard for further development for example it is unclear if you can build in a freight door to turn the 87 into a freighter the wing is good but supercritical wings are standart since the a300 which is a now 50 year old design the main advantage the b787 has over the a380 is that it is engine have over 10percent lower specific fuel burn economicaly the b787 is a desaster for boeing another such victory and they can fill chapter 11 30 bn evelopment cost 30bn deferred cost and as the a350 and a330neo now have the same generation engine it is hard to see how boeing wants to make this cost up when they keep selling for about 110 mio dollar per jet it turend out to be a good airplane but boeing is selling it cheap has huge quality and production issues had a grounding and was lucky not too suffer a hull loss in the early days due to self inflamation they were just luck these jets started burning on the ground i guess that is not sucessfull engineering at least by my means  the fantastic a380 will fly for years to come the 747 as a passenger plane is indeed gone  travelled once before the plaque with 350 once with 380 once with 747 and 787 i would prefer the 350 but it is an even call both are good compared to the double deckers  totally ridiculous mis use of insane rubbish this is better production than a lot of professional documentaries  awesome   6 28 roasted  10 23 aspect ratio 11 11 gliders 11 36 vortex drag 12 22 supercritical aerofoil 13 18 aerofoil dynamics aero elastic tailoring a concept first used in formula1 by red bull to get around the bendy wing restrictions in f1 an ingenious concept that allows the wing to behave exactly like you want at different speeds unfortunately other teams later caught wind of this and it was eventually out lawed by the fia great to see this clever concept has found it is way into the aeronautical industry and is making air travel more efficient   lots and lots of bulls more comfrtanle planes cheaper tickets where the henll do you people live  too bad the youtube cesspool has disabled dislikes because this video deserves a dislike just for saying airlines are benefitting us no it is not not at all  i am thinking most modern jets have had flush rivets for years  5 years of doing aerospace engineering at uni and now i can understand the terms used in this video guess it was worth it after all d alominimum vs aluumanium who would win  is it this the boeng who crashed 2 times and they stopped it from production   6 29 love how you casually mention it  boing is still struggling  feel good sales pitches like this will not change that should it come down to it boing should be allowed to go under are you brag boeing too much here if 787 is so competitive why it desperately rolled out 737 max with a hidden bomb in it that caused the 2 disasters only 5 mos apart killing 346 technologies can be easily hijacked by evil spirit  great design but if you remember that there was long delays on delivery of this plane the reason was that the japanese company that was supposed to make the fuselage was having trouble meeting specifications they could not get the process right without cracks in the fuselage in testing it failed the long delays caused reputation issues and buyers were starting back out boeing executives ordered the planes be built even with these flaws many people working for boeing did not like that they were skipping safety for deadlines and made complaints and were fired the 737 max 8 with its bad stabilization software and system design is proof that boeing is willing to cut corners for profits over peoples lives 2 of these planes dived straight into the ground and would not respond to pilot commands internally boeing is test pilots said that the system was oscillating and none responsive and that it was a big issue boeing deemed it a rare occurrence and went ahead with the installation of the mcas system i would not ever fly on the 787 because its only a matter of time before they start falling apart in mid air   nice video it might have been really helpful to point out the distinction of turbulent flow and flow that has detached and separated from the surface of the wing fully turbulent flows significan not detached flows most significan not  the conor mcgregor cracked leg burn had me crying looks pretty sane to me i still do not trust boeing engineering too many crashes  wonderful though i fear ticket prices will remain high as the company bags more profit i refused to fly in the boeing max just a few weeks ago fuck that  it is just a matter of time now for the ccp to steal all the ip and manufacture a copy  just had to take a crack at mcgregor is career huh  6 28  the 747 was an angineering miracle no a disaster one giant coffin retiring a380s and 747 will never be worth the trade off that is a lot of info for a french interesting first time here  boeing are delusional fact  great stuff bro  you have taught me so many engineering concepts big ups  they should have left it raw color carbon fiber insane engineering is when they stick the wheels on the windows this is all logical engineering get a grip of the english launguage please for fuck sake  i just wished he pronounced composite like i am used to  how do they reduce inflight turbulence for the passengers  test carbon composites are also susceptible to fire and storing fuel within the wings in compartments made of that material with only 1 safety system the nitrogen is a disaster waiting to happen but i guess boeing ought to make that extra buck  title of this video should be killer engineering  the smallest of notes but the mountain show in the video for mt olympus is actually called the brothers mt olympus is further north in the olympic range i really enjoyed this video thank you for making it  singapore airlines had ordered 30 boeing 787 10 dreamliner and 30 boeing 787 8 and 787 9 dreamliner for its subsidiary scoot airlines  i am a composite mechanic and i will tell you there are no button head rivets on the outer fuselage on these type of commercial aircraft they are on c130 type aircraft but they are not traveling at the same type of speeds  amazing effort  when boeing decided to change the materials like those safety caps and copper wires etc or changed the use of platinum material they must have certified themselves by themselves its my suspicion based on what we know now boeing is like huge risk to public safety i have flown on b787 between thailand and uk return flights the plane operated and behaved absolutely fine the cabin windows were slightly bigger but you wouldnt notice the difference as they are not absolutely huge as suggested in this video thank you very much for preparing and posting this video online  the hlfc system is only used on the vertical stabiliser now it was scrapped on the ths if you look at all modern 787 is it is no longer there on the older one is it is a very expensive paperweight  what they should do is make the airplane with the aerodynamic properties of a golf ball that is how you really maximize efficiency  here in washington state i got to watch them assemble a part of the plane in its bigass warehouse facilty they utilize alot of autonomous features to carry parts throughout the house very neat  update i love spacex amp we just got our s dual motor fsd while the tri 4 motor fsd cybertruck gets here i am all in tsla amp i love all elon musk does amp will keep doing we have drove from california to boca chica to see the star ship amp it was so awesome to see it getting built in person we have lots of solar amp backup battery system to charge them both next video the insane engineering of boeing 737 max that would be insanely insane a collapsing profit system and the decline in oil production that no longer meets current needs must less future growth we use 6 to 7 barrels of oil for every one we find means the future is going to be very messy indeed after such a long time i have watched this long video on youtube with full interest thanks for such information   kinda like how cracks in mcgregor is leg shortened his career it was more like cracks in his brain that shortened his career   0 41 0 52 sounds like a paid air travel advertisement that too with shittier seats  what accent is it that pronounces but as boo ut huh   could have been better and faster if boeing execs did not spend as much on stock buy backs and bonuses for themselves  i work for spirit aerosystems a company that builds a350 900 1000 leading edges coolest part of production i have found from further down the production line for airbus at broughton is the top skin for the a350 wing is one solid carbon fibre polymer reinforced panel from what i have found from the research currently being done for the a320 replacement they are looking to have essentially one part to limit the amount of fasteners in the aircraft and separate part numbers etc although i am sure this will be mentioned in the video  the insane engineering of the 787 is having some of the parts amade in china tofu dregs may be ok in the construction of chinese buildings but not airplanes it will not end well  amazing just to correct 5 52 the a350 is made of composites as well but in individual panels instead of a single piece like the 787  the new breed of plane where the number of passengers has dropped tremendously should be an interesting future  the roughness of a shark is skin makes it more slippery so sometimes a smooth surface is not the most efficient also golf balls when composites fail it is catastrophic and quick insane engineering i would be very concerned if the engineering of the 787 were characterized by serious mental health problems still the video was well wicked like bro d the laminar flow systems on the 787 have been phased out on the later aircraft we were the launch customer and have 2 of the test aircraft flying in our fleet the later aircraft have had the system deleted the doors let in air that was ducted along the leading edge and vented out through 1000s of small holes in the leading edge the area is very difficult to repair and the efficiency gains have not been realized hence the later aircraft not being fitted with the system  made to benefit the airlines nothing more  it is pronounced aluminum a lum in num not alaminim  is the 777x being built along the same materials  if it is insane engineering then i have no desire to travel on this aircraft   5 35 the person next to you is me will not be farting as much wrong what are the aspect ratios of some birds  as insane as the 737max no thanks the engineering is somewhat underwhelming due to bean counters taking shortcuts pushing unsafe deadlines and let is not overlook the shoddy manufacturing delivery inspections are embarrassing tools left inside the body sharp edges on milled frame work great ideas are always killed by poor execution  well if the engineering is insane then there is no point in looking at it is there i am sick of this hyperbole  flew in a 787 9 from dfw to anc june of 2021 and a 747 400 dfw to lhr dec of 2018 no comparison as an occasional air traveler and one who has always been fascinated with aircraft yet know very little about them both planes were a bucket list item for me to fly in the 787 9 was wonderful the 787 9 was american airlines and was still as originally delivered from boeing the 747 400 was british airways and had been recently upgraded in the last year or so the 747 400 was a very pleasant flight and very comfortable but it still could not compare to how smooth and quiet the 787 9 was trying to book a flight on a 777 i am just not an airbus fan the few i have been on did not impress me enough to even remember the model number i am sure there is one that could like the a380 but i have yet to be fortunate enough to be on one  hybrid laminar flow control sounds very similar in principle to how the gordon murray t50 is fan greatly improves the diffuser aerodynamic efficiency  overall nice video but some big woopses first the fuselage is not one single piece without fasteners it is made of several barrels that must be joined second carbon fibers do not in any way deform plastically they are linear elastic to failure several smaller mistakes throughout as well but again pretty good video  in preparation for a nuclear power source  one point at 4 20 the limiting factor is that the part has to be cured not just in an oven but in an autoclave which is a pressurized oven the center wing box for example goes into an autoclave capable of 139psi this equipment is much more expensive and much less commonly available than a simple oven  why even after these so called benefits did boeing think moving engines on the wing forward on other aircraft was a good idea to save money on fuel efficiency the max aircraft comes to mind  what planet are you living on when you say there are more and more direct flights  thank you for using the correct expression airplane or aeroplane or plane but not the annoying because not enough specific aircraft that so many have been using so enthusiastically for some time  wow din knew the commentator was a ufc fan conor mcgregor n dustin reference  carbon fiber is strong and looks great just until the point it explodes i can guarantee that they will become throw away jets many problems exist starting with lightning strike capability bubbling carbon fiber is stiffer constant changes in pressure differentials will take their toll boeing loves this airlines will have to buy new jets constantly nobody taking about hail damage to carbon fiber and being outside in the sun uv rays very interesting andreas noak is the absolut expert in carbon materials very recomendeble r i p  insane engineering who writes your video titles a 12 year old  i can not seem to find part 2  flying in a jumbo was so smooth the pilot warned us of turbulence what turbulence  new ideas always look good on paper lets talk in 10 years when these planes reach their end lives  carbon fibre components are fine but what about recycling them already we have plastic particles infecting fish and will also invade man how do we recycle carbon fibre  who else came here to listen to his rrrrrrrrrr pronunciation lol i am an atp and i only want to watch the airframe and powerplant videos why then should i pay for videos i will never watch or sign up and cancel within the same day  so what happen when we run out of fuel so can we glide all way from new york to paris with wind power or solar batteries  watching your videos has made me understand a lot more about and aircrafts and their engineering and i am still in high school and i feel these videos will help me for my future and with my bachelors degree in aerospace engineering and later on too when i am a pilot engineering is not insane the managers of boeing are insane  great video as usual one small thing to say however the a350 xwb fuselage is not in the aluminium but carbon fiber  very entertaining  it is a big ass 3d printer  insane  we are not 13 year old girls reading makeup tips or is the boeing engineering genuinely insane  why 787 but not 987 love my porsche  for the first time i could go from sao paulo to la on a single flight that was amazing  are you just releasing the same video over and over  if it ai not boeing i ai not going lol wtf shoutout ufc engineering nerds xd  6 28 damn bro savage  amazing most comments are probably from kids that have never been on a plane  very informative videos love them thank you just the only thing is the strange sad background music  c f being stronger has another and more important effects besides fuel consumption and large windows try s a f e t y  in 1963 this plane northrop x 21a had laminar flow control this is nothing new boeing is just stealing old forgot technology and calming it for themselves  so what happens when an errant groundcrewman crunches the fuselage with a loader  as a former boeing 787 dreamliner structures and maintenance instructor this video was a pleasure to watch and had great accuracy  thank you for convincing me to never fly boening again airbus all the way from now on  great video  i am not suggesting you are wrong but i was taught that a perfectly smooth surface was not as aerodynamic as a roughened surface an example was given to me like the surface of a dolphin shark or did i misunderstand i do fly gliders and do notice how slippery the grp wings are when landing i think it was that the air pockets allowed water to slip over the surface easier but would this also apply to wind moving over the skin thus removing skin friction i e laminar flow so so you are saying size really does not matter sniffles  check out this video at time 28 55  behind the tail of this plane appears to be a black dot but upon closer inspection it looks very much like a ufo following this plane  its weird if anything else or is it that there is a bug on the lens of the camera of whoever is video taping  i think its a ufo because there have been many instances of ufo is following airplanes in flight that have been documented so this looks like one of those cases  more stiffer and more flexible at the same time that describes me well  love  6 47 the fuselage is just one massive part showing image of nose section separated from mid section and no tail section whoops  pls put more like this video great video i just signed in to curiosity stream but your channel is not accessible or searchable  removing the metallic layer in the wings that protect fuel tanks from lightning strike seems like a bad idea ask high voltage line men they basically wear a metallic mesh suit i would feel more comfortable with boeing deciding to eliminate the lightning conductive mesh from the outer skin of the 787 if they did not have a bad recent track record with cutting costs in the wrong places  as impractical as the a380 turned out to be you have to admire its audacity and its demonstration of engineering prowess  notches fiber everything with chumps like you is insane engineering  yo bro where are you hiding the pot of gold  title should be the insane engineering of carbon fiber  wheres the thrust vectoring i do not know how they can top this the 787 seems more like a wet dream the most beautiful airliner ever made the attention to detail is off the hook boeing management sucks but the designers fly with angles awesome guys  you cannot trust boeing they will know there is a fatal defect but if it is cheaper to pay families than to fix the planes they will wait it out and just murder people and pay families is there really a use for 600 800 passenger planes outside of the military  wow my first thought is purging the holes those unknown panels my second thought is its funny how it security seems to be a priority with trade secrets on non gov contracted designs but every other day you hear about breaches of security leaking tax payer funded r amp d to other countries hopefully its taken as seriously either way im distorting this at the same time  ive never heard of a company fearing being tried for treason d i have been trying to figure out why they do not add electric resistive heating to leading edges i figured design constraints but keep in mind that also takes fuel and power to heat up as well but i figure the savings in weight from tubing and exhaust outweigh the parasitic losses from heating so you are still coming out ahead  i can not stand how slowly and methodically this guy talks i get that he is doing it for the benefit of non native english speakers but for those of us who are native speakers or even just advanced non native speakers it is really annoying  i can understand airbus missing somewhat the lack of dominance of the hub and spoke concept but the operating costs are pretty constant fuel is high salaries for the elaborate staff number of flight hours to reach destinations they knew all that and it is not a matter of blaming the reasons for failure or assigning the blame where you wish to the operating cost we are greatly responsible for killing the a380 the hub and spoke theory did not pan out that is another fact and reason for its failure and there was some continental or political pride in building the biggest passenger airliner it was probably too big boeing admitted years ago that the 747 could have been a little smaller times were much different at the peak of the 747 versus the peak of the a380 i believe airbus was very optimistic on their estimation of i think it was over 1 200 super jumbo jets over the next two decades the triple 7 from boeing has been around 4 i believe two decades or more it is much more fuel efficient and carries many passengers how did airbus engineers miss that do a video on how the engineers at airbus failed it is much more expensive to run a dump truck when a wheelbarrow will do the job it is not a good analogy but it makes the point  i would say that aibus 330 and 350 i way ahead here this is the confirmation bias i needed for my 300 shares of ba i fucking love the connor mcgregor remarks and tie ins pure brilliance   good video composites is pronounced cum pos ets with the emphasis on the 2nd syllable not the first thanks  show me some ultrasonic scans of the composite complex areas please i really like to see them i spent 20 years inspecting composite basically if there not flat they fail the test from resin rich areas  trying to wrap my head around this by putting my hand out of the window while driving this is a really educational video for someone like me who is used to older technology in aircraft design i was always more impressed with the a380 and have only ever flown on a 787 once but now i am far more impressed with this amazing design than i ever was before thanks for a great video  what language is this idiot speaking we need a translater the way they mess up the english language al lu  minium  what is that aluminum is the proper way to say it undoubtedly they can not say some words  great for miniature people great for miniature people did anyone say mcas  composite  pease stress the middle syllable anyone want to say it  no carbon fibre is very difficult to recycle  thanks for the video can we all agree on the proper pronunciation of the word aluminum look there is only one i  was that a conor mcgregor reference subscribed  i love there videos i can not think of doing anything else other than becoming aerospace engineer your videos just over proving that to me thanks for sharing the knowledge great in december of 2021 i just hope i can get on a flight that is not cancelled or delayed so i miss my connection the manufacturers and engineers are no longer trustworthy due to lax federal oversight and pressures from airlines to make that so  cutting edge technology boeing here is our fancy tape dispenser that makes the body of the plane i know it is better but it is just funny direct flights unless you live in australia  just as a passenger the 787 really does have a next generation feel to it in the best sense i find it just a joy to fly in it certainly had some teething issues but it is become an excellent aircraft to fly  when good engineering is ruined by poor management such a shame rip to all lost when scheduling was prioritized over safety the boeing of today is not the good boeing most people still think about good video tho the intro to the video of saying that there are more flights to different destinations without connections isnt really true tbh i mean yeah sure if you live near a major airline hub for eg then of course but otherwise you will have to connect to a big airport that is home to a big airline in order to get to these destinations super as much insane engineering that goes into the 787 i would appreciate more data info relative to the rolls royce engines that were specifically designed for this commercial airliner thank you for making another video that specifically addresses this details thank you  as a coloradan on a 787 i do not feel a difference in pressure because colorado is around 6000 feet above sea level feel bad for people from sea level riding a 737 though    super cool video i had the pleasure of crossing the atlantic in one of these beautiful birds two years ago it is crazy looking out the window and seeing how much those wings can flex these planes also have a surprising amount of power on final approach coming into heathrow we were no more than 150 ft off the ground when suddenly the pilot punched the throttles and pointed the nose high in the sky i was amazed at how hard that thing pressed me back in the seat with brute force and acceleration it was nice to know all that extra power was available if needed which it was due to unexpected congestion on the ground can not wait to fly on a 787 again someday  so a plane made out of plastic huh o   4 15 does anybody know at what temperature the resin is baked in the oven and for how long  it will all fail after a lightning strike sorry reality is real   good video but upvote deserved for the mcgregor porier shot   16 45 doesent the yf 23 already developt this in front of the engine opening an duckt the air out to the top  787 composite construction is far more advanced than the a350 which uses far less composites airbus deemed additional composite use as too risky why are european companies much slower to innovate in aerospace we see similar lack of innovation in european reusable rocket development  that sneak diss to connor mcgregor tho  oh no not another insane yt video  i helped work on the 787 program way back 15 years ago as a contractor but i have never actually seen one in person since what i was helping with was so early before production i had a chance to tour the boeing everett factory which was cool  carbon fibre composite is not 5 times stronger than steel at the same strength the carbon fibre composite is about 5 times lighter than steel additionally there is a whole range of steels and titanium alloys that are much stronger than carbon fibre composites the term strong in my comment refers to the mechanical property called ultimate tensile strength as this is the only way we can compare the strength of various materials  the one about boeing getting money greedy ceos who bypassed a lot of 787 build and design safety steps the one about the engineers striking so boeing made a second plant in a different state to undermine the strikes the one about the step ladder found rattling about between the fuselage and cabin the one about the lithium battery fires   3 40  i find it difficult to join in the chorus of praise for this company when i see chinese signs in their factory i am sure the boardroom cheered the exportation of formerly american jobs to communist china our avowed enemy who openly boasts of their intention to overtake and conquer us to the extent that their military wrote a book detailing how they would accomplish their goal you can download an english translation of unrestricted warfare which was obtained by the cia who then translated it to english and put it into the public domain  is this the airliner that has fallen out of the sky  where is the biggest carbon fiber mine  okay but can it fly into the ocean and completely dissapear like the 777  you should have mentioned the adaptive shims that has caused the airplanes to be grounded for almost a year  first time on your channel and i must say this is a great piece i just followescribed  just hope that one of the two engines does not conk out over the middle of the atlantic or pacific oceans  neat i had no idea that the 787 dreamliner was made so well or that it is made up of a few single composite component parts making up the fuselage and wings pretty cool  good bc every other boeing airframe is trash sir you forgot to mention bonding wires on wing and stabilize and empennage your presentation is good for college student but i thought your programs will make a lot of money like singer political kolor tourist program on youtube  what is boeing going to do with paint not sticking to composite materials over time  having flown a lot since my first international with panam on a 747 i can confidently say the 787 nightmare lives up to its name 1 worst thing i have ever travelled in including thai tuk tuks  great video one critique though the 787 and a350 hardly compete the only crossover is between the 787 10 and a350 900 and even then they are somewhat in different classes though they hold the same passengers the 10 is intended more for medium haul trunk routes and the 900 is intended for longer haul routes that would suit a 777 200 which by the way is the aircraft family the a350 was intended to compete with and ultimately replace   aluminium funny just does not sound right must be hard being british similar to the way they say mee thane  good stuff but you neglected to mention the insane engineering of the aircraft is systems as well pressurization is not via bleed air but electric braking not hydraulic but electric anti icing not bleed air but electric except in engine cowl lip etc etc etc  i got to see a 747 fly over my house today on christmas  before even clicking i was already prematurely mind blown when that 787 hits the ground at 200 mph or faster it will burn alot hotter and faster  between the de icing and the laminar flow suction systems both having an exhaust component in order to work properly would not it make sense to route the exhaust gases out the trailing edge of the wingtips in order to attenuate vortex drag   aluminum  great mind the treasure enjoyed it more flights is nice but there are only so much slots on each airport so more waiting times more delays and less service  5 35 damn i rather enjoy the farting  the mind blowing technology we see today is alien  that ufc joke was dope  the fact that it has been the corporational aspect of boeing e g profitability in gigantic numbers became the cause for its manufacturing processes to lose their value priority we got the best materials we got the best designs we got the biggest volume of orders for our aircraft so tell manufacturing to start slapping our planes together we cannot allow manufacturing to piss on about any manufacturing disconformities hey pass over the cigar box will ya my fellow director let me tell you about my new multi million dollar hi rise apartment in new york then came the plunging of their multi ordered then purchased 777s down from the skies greed has no limitations  all nice but the key issue is neglected which is safety the engineering is marvelous it is the manufacturing that is the crap  i my lucky charms it is fun to see how they disassemble and can those recycled visely i think maybe if it is focused good enough  aye nice unexpected ufc reference haha but just like boeing conor also chose to use metal for the leading edge on his shin going with titanium proper i actually endeavor to fart as much as possible on airplanes  so they do all this work employing extraordinary technological manufacturing techniques in order to build a better airliner and it still has a load of windows along the sides of the fuselage making it heavier less strong less aerodynamically efficient less fuel efficient and making it more difficult and expensive to manufacture why do not they just put flat pannel displays on the inside of the fuselage beside the seats why hav not they been doing this for at least the last decade are the manufacturers just being stupid or am i missing something with a flat pannel faux window you could even make it possible to view in 6 directions instead of just one up down fore aft and to starbord or port just provide a button to select the view you would only need 6 tiny cameras though backups would be desirable you could even make the faux windows really big but do they do this kind of thing naaah presumably they would rather wait for someone like elon musk to do it and put them out of business if the manufacturers are so attached to windows for eg sentimental or psychologically ergornomic aesthetic reasons then why do not just paint or emboss dummy windows onto the outside do they think that the passengers would find it psychologically disturbing not to have real windows i reckon most of them would not even realise the windows were not areal transparrent items unless you told them why do they still pierce what should be a beautiful continuously skinned pressure vessel with a load of windows incorporating heavy frames and tricky leak proof gasketts am i being stupid am i really perhaps i am missing something though  could it possibly be that though the engineers have been advocating this innovation for many years it is been blocked by some pompous twat is of the executive class who think that such a departure from convention is just not on have such twats even employed some bullshit market research types to conduct some badly designed survey that has told them that the passengers would consider it unnacepptable after that is they have spent hundreds of man hours mulling the matter over at board meetings over hob knobs and coffee hell after all they have to do something to justify their existence in the final analysis why do they bother building airliners at all why do not they just devote their energies to giving people brain implants so that they do not have to fly at all everyone can just stay at home in bed and experience a completely virtual life experience or am i possibly taking things a little too far here at least for now no do not tell me they allready have  i have just one word to explain this video  impressive  14 09 oh no not bernoulli again it is not the faster moving air on top of the wing resulting in lower pressure bernoulli is principle that creates the lift needed to keep an airfoil airborne the lift is nearly solely created by newton is third law if the oncoming flow of air is deflected downwards this creates a lift force equal to the force needed to deflect the air so in designing airfoils the attention should go to that part of the wing that deflects the air which is the trailing edge most important about the leading edge is that it is smooth enough as to not create extra drag  back in the day i worked on planes 1 thru 15 in charleston sc building the avionics power harnesses for the main fuselage in order to save weight everything was weighed the wiring has zero service loop and had to be spot on perfect awesome aircraft now i build high performance e bikes on the side  this channel is a bit biased the a350 uses much better composite technology than the 787 in fact boeing asked airbus for help to manufacture the composites i do not trust boeing cost cutting measures we know how they look in the case of the 737 max and the 777 x samsung explained i stop watching your youtube videos do to the number of commercial   nobody absolutely nobody narrator destroys conor mcgregor in an engineering video i love it a few comments 1 what happens when these planes are ready to be scrapped aluminium vs aluminum ha ha gets recycled i would guess the only thing you can do with these composite planes is land fill the the things hopefully they can fly for many more years than aluminum ones just like the b 52 will be in operation for close to 100 years  2 i thought most modern planes use countersunk rivets no 3 the engineering here is staggering 4 without a doubt the most beautiful plane since the lockheed constellation the latter was an eye treat because of its varying diameter fuselage 5 great video so much information thank you  are we just going to ignore that massive dig at conner mcgregor  12 29 dude is aerofoil attempt got foiled by the airfoil in the definition xd a very detailed documentary excellent  fascinating how far this great endeavor has come considering it was only in 1903 that wilbur and orville wright made their first flight that was not long ago really  hope this engineering is better thought out than those 737 max death tubes  before too long a 787 will suffer an explosive decompression and the ntsb report will say something along the lines of a damaged coating on an aluminium window frame caused galvanic corrosion which led to the failure of the part  question why even build planes with windows if we could just use cameras and screens we could then increase the pressure of the cabin way more which would probably be a much greater benefit to the comfort of the passengers compared to having windows  what is the life of composites no one knows till it fails excellent presentation  the insane click bait hyperbole channel real engineering give it a rest  i wonder if scandium aluminum would withstand the electrolytical decomposition  i am already a subscriber to the curiositystream how can i now include nebula it looks quite good but a lot of more development with memory metals and metal press as gigapress technologists could help it perform better  with all the quality control issues with dreamliner program and the faa not taking anymore bs i think its questionable if the 787 program is indeed a success story  i remember a time decades ago when air travel was a high class affair people got dressed up in their sunday is best when they boarded an airplane now days air travel is a cattle call  after watching this video i will have to change my current stance from if it is boeing i am not going  i fly on a 787 9 this monday and am very excited  what about inert gas  all airframe no systems too bad missed the majority of it i know  am i the only one that noticed the connor m dig u think his career is ova perhaps but where did that come from hs i helped design the 787 dreamliner it was a blast  as an mma fans i really enjoy when you mention mcgregor amp poirier you know and i know that airbuses are superior design and are built better than boeings why do you still try to convince people that boeing is as good as airbus  the industry has changed to benefit you and your needs what the industry changes to benefit corporate bottom lines that is the only incentive  i used to own boeing stock after the 737max crashes it became obvious boeing forgot what they make was not planes but a safe method of getting from one place to another quickly boeing management thought boeing made value for share holders how to marry the two competing goals was a forgotten talent boeing paid dearly and frankly i do not think they have learned their lesson  yeah 1 vid is not enough to cover the majority of innovations in the 787 so many ways boeing is trying to save kinetic energy what they have on paper is even farther along than what is in production now   campbeagle  why you say both when saying but  it is paid off at the expense of their middle market planes the 757 767 they are selling a 767f with the same engines from the 1980 is they have made one new plane in the last 39 years they turned into md re warming old designs airbus is killing them in the narrow body market the a220 a321 is a line up that goes against the 737 a plane designed in the 60 is limited by the clearance under the wings what does boeing have between the 737 amp 787 nothing lol fuck em they suck and whatever success airbus has is due to boeing is mistakes  what about the problem with paint on composite aircraft i e the paint and composite material do not expand and contract at the same rates with temperature fluctuations  the pan am flight actually crashed in 1963 not 1967 great learning here thanks man  the fact that we get free documentaries on youtube by real engineering is truly a gift  great irish man speaking here  random mma comparisons  should do a follow up to this the insane overlooked engineering mistakes  you means the airplane with intrinsic technical problems no thank you i stick with airbus when possible us talk arrogance boeing learned from airbus pattern for disaster first the 787 then 787 max and greed finally disaster  mate i think you need to rethink your mic always sounds a bit thin and dry a bit richer sound would do you well keep it up  costtttttt savingssssssss a the issue with burning batteries     great video loved the off the cuff mma references wonderful detail ty  is this when it doesnt crash  learning about water cooling a pc already prepped me on galvanic corrosion it is nice to hear all the places these kind of problems show up  is not this the plane with a million problems and i am talking the new problems that have risen over the past few months  the bigger the plane the more people you can kill at one time  787 is delayed a350 is much better  this is more like an advertisement for boeing f boeing is so bloody wonderful h w come boeing is fatal flaw 737 is crashed and joints in some of the planes fuselage was not joined it then appeared that the aft fuselage section of some 787s would not be able to withstand maximum stress making it more prone to a structural failure whilst in the air now the faa a tame inspection outfit is requesting more evidence that the problems have been solved before the agency will grant permission to restart the production and deliveries boeing 787 quality issues get a new twist it is a known fact that most aircraft manufacturers in the us re in bed with the faa for decades the aircraft manufacturers are on top the faa has b n slapped for allowing workers at boeing to carry out inspections of their own work boeing has uncovered an additional manufacturing problem with its 787 dreamliner according to a person familiar with the matter as it works with u s regulators to restart deliveries of the beleaguered jet the issue pertains to wrinkling in the forward pressure bulkhead in the jets noses customers f the 787 nightmare dreamliners built at boeing is south carolina facility are complaining about production mistakes and quality control issues a faa memo also details about small out of tolerance gaps that have been discovered throughout the airplane structure at the joins of the large fuselage sections at a forward pressure bulkhead and in the structure surrounding the passenger and cargo doors the faa memo which lists safety conditions affecting aircraft currently in service worldwide states that these tiny gap defects are thought to be present in more than 1 000 dreamliners the boeing chicago bean counters are to blame they are consumed by out sourcing union busting and the bean counters obsession with cutting costs f it is boeing i am not going   unfriendly skies by rodney stich modern assassination is to knock down the airplane just an accident nothing to see here stop saying compa sits  787 boeing junk  i can be deem a naive in commercial aviation knowledge can some experts with hands on knowledge enlighten me airbus vs boeing which is better i just want to know becuzi keep seeing how they are utter rivalry someone in my extended family worked on the 787 in its early development days the informal inside code for it was atek for a three eighty killer boeing took a huge chance in taking the p to p position with the 787 vs airbus major hub position with the a380 this in part is what caused airbus to develop the a350  everything is insane  uh  ummmm it is pronounced a loo min num  looks impressive but i will never fly with boeing it is most corrupted and money hungry company on the market  i did not expect to hear this 6 27 on an engineering channel i died laughing d this aircraft is plagued with issues do not bet on it surviving certification yet  45am i benefiting from this change are you serious the demise of the a380 not everyone can travel business or first class in fact more people travel economy and premium economy thank business and first class so the demise of those larger planes means the demise of comfortable and spacious seats that is available to econ travelers though out the world  i am sure boeing has a bright future they handled unions badly for a while but that is a wall street culture they have realised does not do them any good it is better to work with them and they have come up with some good cmpromises like the moving platform on the production line at everette it moves very slowly though a couple of metres per hour i think some of their decisions had been downright dangerous anyone who saw the al jazeera documentary would be concerned not sure how you can have one body promoting the industry and safety there are contradictions and it makes it less safe  if the 787 is insane then what is the concorde  take two smaller ones or three wtf my husband used to make these along with the landing gear of the shuttle i know what goes on with this shit  thank you iam fond of planes i work in the aerospace industry it is the most farcical wasteful industry going nothing incredible about it by the time the plane is complete most of the parts have already been shipped around the world multiple times they have more air miles and a bigger carbon footprint than your average politician not to mention the fact that all the millions of parts are wrapped and unwrapped multiple times all the work is so heavily subcontracted and compartmentalised and as a trade most folk who work in the lower tier aerospace industry would have been better off learning plumbing joinery bricklaying etc admin lower middle and higher management are higher paid and treated better than the engineers actually doing the work  too bad boeing and airbus will not work together to benefit everyone they both have lots to offer  i had no idea it was that different so impressive that so many leading edge process and designs are incorporated saying this is just another boeing is like saying stuffed crust is just crust  great content as usual thanks 777x is not happy about this this video was very interesting from an engineering perspective obviously my question to anybody willing to answer is are they still selling this aircraft and is there still orders on the go for production or has production ceased  i bought curiosity stream how do i get nebula they said i would get an email  an absolute marvel of engineering  is not the airbus a350 kinda the same thing  i live 4km away from an international airport so over the course of this video 7 or 8 787 8 and mostly 787 9 were passing overhead watching for the 100 000 000 000th time   faa memo reveals more boeing 787 manufacturing defects including contamination of carbon fiber composites the litany of manufacturing defects on the 787 dreamliner is expanding as boeing engineers take apart planes and discover new or more widespread issues the memo which was circulated internally monday he memo notes that the faa is still evaluating boeing is proposal to use statistical sampling to determine which airplanes are affected by the lack of shims and tiny gaps at the joins ore than 1 000 airplanes currently flying are affected and that the faa is concerned about the lack of detailed assembly data on every airplane boeing submitted its proposal for inspections and indicated that the process would not require faa approval we firmly disagree the memo states this standoff over what level of inspections is appropriate remains the major stumbling block to boeing resuming 787 deliveries  seattle times nov 19 2021  harreson watts the edas was actually on both horizontal and vertical stabs at the start but then the horizontal stab ones were discontinued  the comet went bang from metal fatigue 7 000hrs in  i do not fancy being a guinea pig battery fire anyone  advanced technology and impressive but it does not say much about how some airlines still make us uncomfortable by cramming us in and charging us more  so they got near bird wing efficiency almost organic  contaminated german fiber no accident  i can not be the only one freaking out about the sheer awesomeness of pores in composite skin that allow for air to be sucked in to increase fuel efficiency by 30percent freaking pores man wtfh that is so futuristic amp dope 12 58 am i the only one that saw a smiling planet take off no  cerbon fibre perts haha love the accent   wrapping a carbon fiber tape impregnated with a plastic resin  and now productions is halted because of several issues  unt all the chipps they bet on thiss they losing on the 737 max so th y back to square on profits   its literally a plane designed by an f1 team i just wanted to say that the a350 is competing with the 777 not the 787 what is the song played between 24 40 and 26 40  titantium itself isnt that rare or expensive the production of titanium alloyed parts is diamond cbn or ceramic can not be used for the production of titanium parts because of the chemical reactions titanium is a material that doesnt save up heat heat well and thus the heat gets directed on to the cutting edge and at the same time has a high cutting force shortening the tool life of your inserts tool significan notly this means you will have high production cost and production time while working on titanium alloys cfrp or carbon fibre reeinforced polymers can be very abrasive towards your cutting edge however the cutting force is quite low and at the same time here you can use diamond coated tools as there is no reaction with the coating and the cfrp material  so from what i understand the early 787s will be safer better built than future 787s because of the extra titanium and the extra safety measures used in the wings regarding the lightning strike protection etc it is a shame when companies take out safety measures regardless if it was not needed to that extent in order to cut costs you never know what could happen in that scenario  fantastic wow  i seen the effects of how flexible wings are loved it great video very informative a shame then that at 12 37 the word symmetric is spelt incorrectly  i have been so lucky to have had the experience of 4 flights on this magical aircraft when the wings flex and the leading edge and flaps flex along with the wing it just seems right like a bird in flight i have never felt so safe as when i have had the fortune to be a passenger  amazing work thank you could you do a video on the a350 please  boeing squandered its reputation with the 737 max nonsense  did not the a380 also have composite materials and a lot earlier than this  these planes will be disposable after they develop cracks i suspect in 10 years there will be alot of these new gen planes breaking apart in turbulent air like but background music is not suitable  it remains to be seen how galvanic corrosion will affect metal parts in the next 30 years as well as lightning excellent video thank you for sharing  love your accent but cannot get over you saying strenth instead of strength where did the g go  while the planes technology is better they certainly are making comfort worse for passengers who arnt in first class i am taking fluid mechanics and it is really cool to see how concepts learned in the class get applied great video  loved the mma reference lol what if one of my needs is to see an a380 land in high crosswind  i still can not comprehend why there are hardcore 787 haters out there this plane is an absolute beauty  i like the ufc quips did you no you did not did you animate a 3d spacemouse on the engineers desk oh my god sir your accuracy is impeccable  if listening to my professor was half as interesting as this  the greatest aircraft ever built learn how to say aluminum dude  what is not being said is the aluminum panels are 10x thinner then carbon fiber carbon must be much thicker for so not to snap amp the thickness gives the strength even being much thicker then aluminum it is still much lighter  take some carbon fiber mat amp pull on it it breaks the tinsel strength is horrible take some kevlar amp try the same kevlar is tinsel strength is much much stronger i fuse them with resin or get prepeg matting k have it cured carbon is much lighter that is true but when it fails it fails so much worse then any metal  bullshit the tickets cost more and more u are explaining really thoroughly and i love that  are we not going to say anything about the mcgee for comment  realengineering can you no longer gift subscriptions i have been doing that for my younger brothers christmas gift since you started nebula but it tell me your code is not valid for gift cards will that come back closer to christmas or is it done all together  the outer surface of the plane is quoted with a unique paint to prevent the direct contact of water and oxygen how about a video on the insane manufacturing of b787  it is a shame he talks about breaking wind in the middle of an otherwise professional presentation  excellent video booking a flight on a boeing plane is like committing suicide  excellent and neat graphics clear narration and easy to understand explanation have to say even as an aeronautical engineering student i have learned quite a bit from this video  a lum i num  its too bad theyre finding so many defects with this aircraft boeings quality control has gone straight downhill  i gotta say that ufc reference caught me off guard  25 03 that is our crappy paint hanger i always check what type of plane im flying before purchase the ticket as for now let me be fly airbus nasa tec i am intrigued by the 1k negative assessments of this video but would have to wade tbrough the 26k positive ones to find them what is the beef a 1 26k ratio of warmist killjoys or something a little more substantial has the emphasis on durch technik doubled the length with an admix of repetitive crap i can not see it the commentator is voice at times seems to convey an almost robotic sense of self assuredness but all in all it is not hard to see why this video is broken up by so many ad is these videos are very good especially this one and full of fine detailed information really love your chanel man  i never thought i would watch a 30 minute video explaining the engineering behind an aircraft understand it and even feel amazed by it subscribing right away   3 53 we all just gonna ignore the fact that my man just said  a carbon fibre tape impregnated with a plastic resin  too many bs commercials hi where is part 2 wow ya gotta be super engineer to keep all that knowledge in your head but great writing that is whoever wrote the script for this video  this plane is not without it is issues though foremost of which is the standards to which it is manufactured the wiring is appalling underneath the flight deck is a rat is nest there is so much electrical load that the systems have to be liquid cooled and the pumps for these systems are horribly unreliable the air conditioning should not be run on the ground as it breaks easily the paint is literally flying off the wings the edas system on the ths is nothing more than a dead weight that is getting carried around as it is negligible in it is effect and is deleted on later aircraft and is only used on the vertical stabiliser as for the rolls royce engines the best thing is that as an engineer it is given me a lot of money with all the overtime it is generated with its unreliability if you want to see a well built aircraft then look at the a350 it is stunning  whenever i see boeing while booking ticket i always say to myself hell no i am not traveling in that mass coffin   thanks this is probably the insane youtube channel for me which i love it  it is like an olympic swimmer shaving his body thank for sharing i have learned that i will leave my safety in god is hands then in your see you later bless all flights excellent content thanks   6 25 i know where that is d removing that copper mesh presents a real problem considering it was the best bet against lightning if i were a billionaire this video would have convinced me to buy 5 of these documentary class production quality on youtube for free truly the pinnacle of education i am not impressed boing just killed around 500 people in two incidents within a few weeks a couple of years ago was it the same technology  the way he says but tho to what gs is it built to  great job dumbing down common but complex concepts you have a way about yourself where you can easily be the smartest person in the room but not throw your weight around an make people feel it  bravo  ahh this takes me back to my atpl theory thanks  13 33 did you use bernoulli is equation to model compressible gas it is for incomprehensible ideal fluid  let is be honest with the materials improvements engineers will find way to cut materials cost so the overall durability will be similar to aluminum planes   2 34  if they want to lower drag just cut the tiny black parachute off the tip of the tail  i wish i could fly on the 787 this video is a piece of art it is a very modern aircraft but boeing has fallen short in its quality control not maintaining the strict standards of the aeronautical industry this has caused boeing to lose billions of dollars it has failed to keep its joint venture commitments with embraer and airbus has consolidated its world leadership it is not enough to be the first to launch you have to be the first in quality  do you work for them the fockn will come i use your video to sleep wow amazing video amazing plane  airlines or airplane manufacturers doing something to benefit the customers i can not stop laughing that is the most ridiculous sentence i have heard in a while  i still could not believe that 747 the queen of skies is gone  building huge ovens is not too hard building huge autoclaves is a nightmare if i remember right they cure it in clave  nothing insane about it my friend nothing at all  is this the plane that fall out the sky by itself  i love your videos they always make me wonder of the capabilities of the human mind and how far we can get when we push our limits and as an engineer myself i am proud of our tribe did i say i love your videos i love them  how do they put aluminium on the leading edge of the wings and engines of its going to corrode  people are so dang smart it absolutely blows my mind watching videos like this and seeing the engineering that takes place  this is unreal i hate the windows larger ones would be worse they are cold and there is nothing to see but clouds  thank you for a great and well understandable video about fascinating technology   7 34  hey wing tips can reduce vortexts do not they you can have a very big window on planes without having no windows just install screens that streams the outside i have something here use it aircraft companies  wait wait wait  i have always wondered what happened to the metal shaved away during cnc you are telling me it is not packed up and recycled somewhere are you kidding me please tell me somewhere out there people are remelting and recycling those materials we have got to be better than just throwing it away by now does anyone know  excellent video very informative one correction however the main bending structure of the wing box is the upper and lower skin suefaces not the front and rear spars the whole box provides the torsional strength  any 1 the name of the tune playing in the background that starts at 7 50   lower pressure also dries out the air which in turn makes food taste either bland or otherwise odd so not only is 6 000 foot pressure more comfortable overall it may even make the in flight food taste better   18 00 hey shade tree mechanics the phenomenon being described here if you happen to be unfamiliar with it is called galling in the auto mechanic world this effect is what causes certain fasteners in your car to become badly frozen together ever try to get a lug nut off an old wheel only to have the stud twist and break have a head bolt or stud nut combination so badly frozen you have to use a blowtorch or drill the bolt out it is all coming from the same source as what is being discussed here it is impossible to get rid of galling completely but permatex anti seize lubrican not should always be in your tool kit use it everywhere you need to torque down nuts and bolts fairly tightly it works very well in what it does and i will leave it at that description galling literally means that the surfaces that are torqued together over time will begin to share molecular bonds between the two metals that are tightened together at the molecular level this means the two materials share electron orbits so well that it is actually impossible to say where the bolt ends and the hole in the block starts impossible to tell where the lug nut ends and the stud begins or on german cars where the bolt ends and the hub assembly begins  i am way off topic compared with what is going on with this video but when i heard the term galvanic it put me in mind of times i have cursed the day i was born because i would encountered a frozen nut or bolt i had to write this for those folks who are not afraid to grab their toolbox and dive under the hood of their car only to find something they would never quite seen be so stubborn as this particular bolt in that particular assembly get yourself some permatex and use it on everything you torque down from lug nuts to head bolts  those bolts that hold your alternator or starter in place the bolts that hold cv joints to half shafts and anything having to do with exhaust manifolds and catalytic converters somewhere down the road you will be happy you did  ps cheesus i love videos on this channel  it makes engineering as compelling as a good mystery novel or thriller at the cinema  it is centripetal force btw not centrifugal  i live in san diego and get see these amazing passenger jets as well as fighter jets on a daily basis and it never gets old   he could not hold back the laugh talking bout farting lol fun fact but at 4 58 that mountain is not mt olympus it is the brothers which is at 6 842 of elevation same mountain range though  wait ww2 aircraft had operational ceilings above 30 000ft yet near contemporary aircraft were only pressurized to 8 000ft  lets be clear while that metal might be a loss in terms of the immediate product being created by the machining process make no mistake all those shavings are recovered and recycled i know this does not change the cost analysis however viewers might want to know that all that metal is not being wasted  eevibes so happy that more engineers also enjoy trolling conor mctapper  9 09 so i was really not understanding the meanings of the percentages used here so maybe the references would help and even more confusion ensues ref does indeed cite 1 9percent but i am still lost a percent of what but is an army test on a company is weapons grade aluminum which also includes comparison to 2 other types of al none of the 3 had anything at 1percent that was cited in this video  many were actually at around 10percent  hey guys can i get discount nebula  without curiosity i do not like curiosity  my granddaddy was the pioneer in the use of reinforced carbon carbon the late 60 is early 70 is term for fancy carbon fiber on an airframe he was a mcdonnel douglass engineer at the time and believed that it was the material of the future all his bosses and coworkers thought he was crazy and it would fail catastrophically if it ever suffered a lightning strike he finally convinced some of his higher ups to let him try it out on the airbrake for some f 15 is as if that failed it would not bring down the aircraft eventually one of them did get hit by lightning and it did not explode or fall apart that turned out to be the defining moment of his career he went on to lead the design team for the aces ii ejection seat and eventually become the chief program engineer for the f 16 and f 18 projects unfortunately there is not much else myself or any of my family knows about what he actually did because most of it is still classified by the feds and he could never really tell any of us about most of the stuff he worked on and was pretty humble in general so nobody in our family ever even realized how big of an impact he had until he passed away and we saw the letters and the people who showed up for the funeral this made my day to see what his idea has become over 50 years  galvanic corrosion aluminium corrodes so why is there both in the wing   so yeah these airplanes are getting pretty complicated to make eh just do some paper mach but plastic  5 6 years ago i started watching you videos i joined the navy soon after and now i am a level 3 electrician lead at northrop grumman i love these videos man i suggest them to all my friends and coworkers  boeing has always compromised on passenger safety vs cost saving when compared to airbus have always prefered the airbus when air travel in unavoidable  all this is good but somebody also needs to increase the speeds of these planes it is a drag to sit in a plane over 3 hours how i wish the concordes came back  how much legroom though  this is an amazing aircraft but i wonder how repair able it will be when it receives damages to the composite materials if the plane suffers a tail strike or is hit by foreign material they can not drill out some rivets and replace panels on the fuselage great video sir but at 13 31 the particle motion is in line with equal transit theory which is not true would have been a better visualization if the upper particles reached the trailing edge earlier as shown at 16 34  airbus is eating boeing is lunch  an hour of nerdy information well do not mind if i do  is this video and airplane supposed to make all of boeing is sins go away  i thought the airbus a350 was made from carbon composites too and not aluminum  the mcgreggor comment loll in a video about the 787 i learned that the 737 has bigger windows than the a350   the entire nature of air travel has changed to benefit massive multinational corporations is what he meant to say  i swear this guy was giving elon a rough time for trying to build his new rocket from carbon fibre just flew on a 787 for the first time a couple of days ago at the time it still felt kind of sardine like the only things i would really noticed were how high the wings seemed while in flight and the dimming windows i just watched the hour long video on nebula and definitely lots of other cool things to learn about this plane  disaster of a plane only marginally better than the max but just like the max the truth about this monstrosity will come to light  fantastic video detailed info no one else really cares about  it really seems like they were trying to shake things up with the 787 you can see how they went through all the systems and went why do we do this is there a better way almost like someone said what are the design decisions we have been glossing over as how we do things but now we have a better way  a truly impressive feat of 21st century engineering then i heard the bit about boeing taking off the copper sheathing in the wing i shuddered it sounds like the executives are more concerned about the bottom line than real world safety i fear that this will end up much like the 737 max  wrong again covid made air travel more expensive than before planes will be half filled but at 5x the price this is how greedy aviation industry gonna take advantage to recoup their 2 yrs financial losses from borders lockdown  well thats what was said about 737max boeing has been quite naughty about its safety features lately lets wait if 787 gonna see similar fate like 737  ya revolutionized killing innocent people  cost of air travel is getting cheaper what planet are you living on where i am the prices have been going up on any excuse riding fuel prices covid etc whatever savings the airline is making is being channeled into their own coffers economy class passengers will continue to be squeezed like cattle  i know the debate is one but i would like to raise the question if someone can please respond to me with arguments and synthetically which one is the best between the a350 and the b787 and under which circumstance thanks great video thoke the subscription buth do not see where to enter the realengineering code  had to stop and like for the ufc analogy   com paw zit loved the video  737 was a flop why all the hype for this 787 the company has been proven to be corrupt  3 14  big plane made of plastic  knowing that they swapped the cockpit frame for aluminum only guarantees me that i will never step foot on that plane screw their special coating  great video thanks ex framey so tragic airplane nut   the person next to you will not be farting as much i am not so sure  it is amazing to see f1 materials and aero tech being applied to massive aircraft  good job  outstanding as someone who works in airframe design i am amazed at your ability to concisely and clearly present the concepts involved 10 10 why is it insane  the film is extremely pedahogue seems like the lecture of a rundown professor  no commercial airplane can de ice itself on the ground  every commercial airplane has to be deiced with de icing fluid  and i thought my walmart rc plane was a superior plane what accent is this  so you know i already have curiosity stream and i can not find your channel in the search function  please do a episode on the saab j6b i subscribed to this channel way way pre 1 mil subs and gave the reader sh t for his accent fast forward few years his linguistic abilities have reached new heights amp his content gets better video by video thank you for starting such an interesting youtube channel appreciate all the interesting technical and highly detailed content paired with amazing visuals and a really good narration wish you the best  the a350 can not be made of both composite material and aluminum so which is it  not a fan about removing the copper from the skin i think that is a bad move by boeing it looks like it will be fine but not happy that they did not try to find an alternative  how can you say the fuselage has no joints when you can clearly see it in multiple parts it just shows you have no understanding of what you are reading  only people are insane specially those at boeing the 787 is a nightmare of problems  in fact airbuses have about the same proportion of carbon fibre in their construction as the 787  how much did boeing pay you for this pr hit piece hundreds of dead passengers and this  finally inovation airbus has been eating boiegn ass for too long now  really high quality content thank you  great learning  less travel because of vaccines and lockdowns the only insane thing about the 787 and the 737s is that boeing can still legally make and sell these death traps  the same would be nice to see from the a350 well yes you could reduce drag with a higher aspect ratio or we could switch to bell shaped span loads and kiss goodbye to wingtip vortices oh and a vertical stabiliser  one p north american use o emphasizing boeing wow as if airbus did not exist ha ha ha let is see when one of the 737 max those are the jewel in the crown no   26 42 ah nice boeing cutting again from safety a glutton for punishment arent they   13 43 bernoulli is principle ap physics 2 for the win lmao i am not going to lie this video kinda helped with my fear of flying i do not know it just felt comforting  dude just cover my 4 year engineering course in 30 minutes brood of crazy dog barked amp panted at the engineer the difference in performance does have a downside though the weakness is that of the weakest link in a hybrid construction and that can include different expansion coefficients or contraction if you like at low temperatures this is likely the cause of the wishbone microfractures in the 737  man is took shots mcgregor so they bake planes now investing in crypto is the best way to earn financial freedom  let is go up the mountain in datong lol love the irish accent and of course the reference to conor mcgregor   can not they use a plastic that can be cured using uv  hey mate do you have a video of the insane engineering of the 737 max you know the one that tries to kill you because its center of gravity is fked up and boeing lied about it  too long  is this fanboism sponsored by boeing to mask over their disastrous nose diving planes grounding all planes worldwide what a quack and blatant misinformation airbus had already started use of technologies fbw and composite materials in a380 way before boeing  this company has some of the best engineering minds and the worst management minds as well always screwing with the engineers in order to save money and we saw what happened with 737 max for example  unfortunately boeing just announced another problem with this plane regarding the titanium parts before that was others and all started with batteries catching fire etc revolutionary design but does not tolerate human mistakes  wow this is a very impressive comprehensive video it is my engineering diploma wrapped up in a nutshell it would be interesting if you could explore ndt methods for keeping this aircraft airworthy ndt is another whole new challenge with composite aircraft  attention with boeing in general 737 max is a very dangerous too  boeing discloses a new problem with the 787 dreamliner by chris isidore cnn business updated 10 50 am edt tue july 13 2021 the faa finds new problems in some undelivered 787 dreamliners 07 13 2021 wsj news exclusive business boeing deals with new dreamliner defect amid production problems aircraft maker regulators scrutinize titanium parts on 787 dreamliner boeing cites improvements the penitent replace multivariately imagine because thunder outstandingly relax amid a alike bathroom agreeable silent step father that boeing 787 dreamliner and 737 max showing a company in decay and are best thing airbus could hapen i am so happy my life is totally changed i have been earning dollar10 250 returns from my dollar4 000 investment every 13 days makes me remember my first love aerospace engineering i did not fall too far off mechanical engineering nano composite materials and nanotechnology in general are now a passion of mine  i still love the 747 nice ireland ai commentator same as mustard i think it is safe to say that we are in the future of aircraft manufacturing have you seen the aljazeera report on boeing production of the 787 kinda alarming   insane  i will say so that whole lithium battery f k up got me five months off with full pay  i really love both this and the a350 though i like the a350 more visually such beautiful planes   kind of like cracks in mcgregors leg career ended it early i was washing dishes and bought dropped a knife on my foot that mcgregor reference was spot on hahaha amazing the amount of engineering that goes in to airplanes  yikes i did not notice this was half an hour long until i had 5 minutes left  phenomenal production values on this presentation  nice channel great job  insanely amazing video must do one about the uh 60 blackhawks wing sper  amazing videos thank you  this video was sponsored by boeing  not airbus fuck airbus boeing nope i do not want to fly in a flying coffin noone english people bouut you mentioned bleed air being used for deicing the leading edge of the wings and engine cowling taking power and efficiency from the engines how much does the bleed air used to pressurize the cabin affect engine efficiency loved the video i worked at boeing wichita as a machinist in the late 70s that was before the bean counters from mcdonald douglas got in there and screwed it up  so what happens now if the plane gets hit by lightning  who else want the engineering of 777 very nicely done the 787 is truly a spectacular aircraft you did a great job of showing why  operation paper clip lol china russia us has that technology that has been in existence for 65 years so if that is where we are think what is possible electric vehicles bikes cars skateboard surf boards and a lot of other stuff computers are needed to run jets rockets time travel and just about anything else you can think of think about that quantum technology is the new technology that will get us to a destination in light years in the matter of minutes so is time travel it is very much real this is why dod owns the hit series star gates sg1 most people including myself have always trusted that the anti gravity experiment was not possible until i found out differently i have had mine since 1975 everyone who had a security clearance still retains it until they pass away lol i only have a high school diploma and i know a lot of technology quantum computing technology is the answer for over 60 years us has alien technology space force has already gone to other galaxies hundreds of times the sr 72 has been in existence since 1990 the tr3 b has been in existence since 1980 the reason no one knows about this is the patents on secret technology time travel has been done already creation of plasma field in propulsion will lead to expansion of speed time times motion times electromagnetic waves times faster than light speed that is what happened in the lab i bet you 2 cents that that generator would go so fast it would self destruct using liquid nitrogen on a small scale plasma generator try researching the new mathematical technology process on quantum technology made several trips on the dreamliner with norwegian air beautiful plane and great service first class all times quiet speedy great looks and big windows  so can the 787 fly over the tibetan plateau and overcome the turbulence there  can we talk about the roof trusses in that assembly shed  mcgregor shot love it  hey man i have loved your videos for years and just wanted to tell you thank you special thanks for aluminium  the issue with composites elongation is its limited plastic region the practical problem of this is composite structures do not complain before failure in general aviation this means pilots hitting the structural limits of an aircraft in aluminum will hear groaning and pull out of the maneuver composite will fail without warning in airliners this a minimal issue as they are flown in very specific ways but in personal aircraft this can be a problem  real engineering explained thats a fact pity the xxx is such a mess  looks just like that sh t trump grounded to me  the all new ground grabber from boeing the last ride of your life  is carbon fiber really 25 x stronger weight than steel  5xstronter and 1 5 weght equals 25 nice coomer mcgregor refrence lovely  had no idea the 747 could carry 660 people  you should do the a350 next  all new designed are more scrutinized by the faa while 737 max exploits loopholes from faa and other global regulations  does this plan has mcas if yes m not flying in it  yeah show me more capitalistic monopoly ah airbus boeing rip to those people who dislike this video  of course all that wonderful engineering does not amount to squat if the software nerds screw everything up trying to over complicate the electronics  set a bullshit video trying to boost an craft that i would not even step foot in an action rejected flights recently demanded another aircraft i do not trust boeing so this is a bullshit video trying to give boeing credit where it is not doing  kinda like how cracks shortened mcgregor is career burn  going to thumbs down every video on this channel that uses the lame word insane in its title  dude what the hell are these technologies lmao these people are insane this thing is pretty amazing as is the video never been that into planes but it is still impressive to see such massive machines carving through the air like that and i am all for improved efficiency  when the carrier picks the cheapest of everything plastic you get an uncomfortable noisy piece of junk i tried economy economy plus and business and they were all awful i even wrote to the carrier and asked them if they had other planes like a 747 or any airbus not impressed on a long haul flight 7 hours you need decent seats not something like a cheap rally driver is seat  doing a phd about carbon and writing a journal article with this as the background hearing technology researched decades ago give me the motivation to do my own hoping what i do now would benefit mankind enough to merit its own real engineering video in the future  seems like sane engineering to me  as a non practicing civil engineer i love the ability to explain complex ideas in a simple contained in this video also although the content gets into areas which i know little about as far as i could see the concepts are correctly applied which contrasts with other youtube channels with multiple evident errors so in short thank you for a great video  a350 is also made of carbon composites not aluminium please make a video on antonovs put your left hand up in the air if you think that boeing and nasa have access to the best scientists and engineers in the world and you think that their designs are genius put your right hand up in the air if you trust the boeing management to not force the engineers to make compromises in safety to hit a target price for these aircraft now i can visualise thousands of people with one hand in the air  also from my personal experience with the dreamliner the huge window is truly mind blowing but other than that it just does not feel too different from the previous generation airliners all those fancy technologies that were aimed to bring a revolutionary passenger experience were completed ruined by its narrow seat width with a 3 3 3 layout in a relatively narrower cabin for a 6 foot 1 man like me the 777 with a wider seat beats the dreamliner in passenger comfort by a mile despite all the latest tech advancements in the latter sometimes customer experience is as simple as that  ironically roughly half of the dreamliners in the skies have chosen the rr trent 1000 power plant which we now know is plagued with disastrous reliability and has caused many troubles this ill fated engine combined with boeing is poor quality control and corner cutting production processes in recent years specifically at the south carolina plant has severely tarnished the dreamliner is reputation what would have become an engineering marvel and a game changer in the industry has turned out to have stirred many controversies and complaints among its customers being frequently grounded and out of service do not get me wrong i am still a huge fan of boeing and am amazed by the sheer amount of engineering ingenuity that goes into the dreamliner but i can kind of relate when people say that the less innovative but more proven 777 is the last truly great products of boeing  who else can not believe they watched this to the end  yay i feel much better now pretty interesting informations here  if you were my teacher in high school i would have had a is in math physics and chemistry  i have been watching sooo many airliner crashes lately and literally everybody dies on the plane when it crashes i wonder how this one will hold up am a pilot this is an excellent video single discrepancy i noticed to my knowledge the larger the interior of the aircraft the more difficult it is to pressurize especially at much higher altitudes where the air is thin and there is not much air the plane can take in to use to pressurize  i can never find these videos on curiosity stream  i sorry but the 787 is a lemon  two things i hate hearing in the same story new airplane design and cost saving measure  wonder why boeing is keeping so many secrets developed with public money  around minute 13 we start getting into bernoulli is principle i have watched credible videos as to whether this principle is applicable regarding airfoils i am still so confused that was a very good video   15 58 do not say the l word 3 times or you will summon  him  wait a second people did any of you who praise this video watched the boing 787 broken dreams i al jazeera investigations  could you do a video of the airbus a350 as well  small or major flaw using metal i beams in the wings mixing metal amp carbon fiber not easy as temperature expansion are very different  boeing having problems with 737 max 777x 787 made in carolina opening for russia amp china will they step up  i have often thought that the 787 resembles an albatross maybe it is not a coincidence  an amazing leap forward in aircraft construction and design outstanding video thank you   6 28 conor mecgreggor roasted  whats yr favorite turbulent or laminar  the fact that human beings figured this shit out never ceases to amaze me waist of time no technical details although the 3d printing company is name is norsk titanium you could have said norwegian titanium titanium just happens to be written the same way in norwegian and english so the confusion is understandable  fans impeller blower centrifugal fans kitchen exhaust fan tube axial fans direct driven centrifugal fans fans filter unit belt driven centrifugal fans inline duct fans  shocking that the dreamliner and starliner are made by the same company when the latter has failed so hard next video the insane supply chain of the 787  what about the lithium ion batteries i prefer the a350  planning on becoming a commercial pilot myself i hope one day i get to fly a 787 or a newer generation which i think no one can even yet image amazing video please continue lt 3 and thank you so much  great video but just to correct one thing at the end the 787 has a composite leading edge not metallic the surface is aluminium both for abrasion resistance and as the l e is a common attachment point for lighting the heater blankets behind that are e glass to insulate the electronics and the slat itself is carbon fibre you need an electric ice protection to do use composites in this area bleed gas typically runs too hot  another use of aeroelastic tailoring is in wings of f1 cars is the excess metal in machining recycled by sending it back to be melted down and reforged into a new block   13 40 please do not use bernouli on 2 separate streamlines this is not allowed especially since you are talking about compressible flow lmfao evil capitalists keeping technology secret so the world won t benefit from it  at the 16 10 mark i swore he said laminar flow was non erotic lol i was thinking what the heck does that mean turns out it was non erratic  am i  as someone who studied civil engineering that explanation of the stress strain diagram side by side with the pull out test was very satisfying loving it   is will it fly without maxing out  rip airports the wanting fowl practically applaud because journey echographically unfasten atop a obedient thursday savory dirty hate how much did boeing pay you for this infomercial  i will never in my life build a plane and yet  i watched all this video  watching this form airplane  pog airplane cannot be repaired for minor damage due to unibody graphite construction  having been a design and manufacturing engineer on the 787 program i really appreciated this video there was so much content about the systems i was not aware of being on the structures side thank you for the creation and upload  this is an amazing commercial boeing created i love how the narrator has no specific accent it could be english or scottish or aussie nothing in particular pleasing to all great job boeing good for all english speaking humans everywhere  so ummmm wth is the deal with the klm logo between 12 16 amp 12 18  is that a video compression artifact or does the skin have an embedded display  excellant video i work on the 787 daily for a major airline some things us amt is just do not know so now i know more about this aircraft just totally amazing airplane thx for the video  let is hope boeing is fixing its quality control at sc plant for these planes i so much love this channel that even if i am not educated i love listening to intelligent documentary  fiber plane the mute guatemalan methodologically grab because record seemingly delay beneath a nutty octagon private tangible voice on the window comparison slide you compared the 787 window size with some equivalent aluminium airlines but the a350 fuselage is made from composite materials too though  you have summarised what i have studied in materials engineering great research work kudous   13 56  amateur journalism kills cancel qantas cancel australia they have become an absolute dictatorship due to covid  i love that he has a rant video about the imperial system on his channel but uses feet in this video yes it is standard in the aviation industry but that does not excuse the use of stupid imperial units  this vid knocks it out of the park fabulous you should explain strain and stress and ductility and hardeness force to get it right and maybe understood  the mosquito was made in plywood in mass and it worked very well  wow i thought this video would be cool and it exceeded my expectations by a lot totally kick ass video  too american for my taste  airbus is a trillion times better period  very interesting but why use the word insane in the title are the engineers insane  first time i heard about the use of carbon fiber and more super cool stuff in airplanes it seems that the hardware part of airplanes is getting better but the software part buggy i am a complete ignorant on the subject could somebody with knowledge enlighten me  u make really great videos  it would be better if u could just release 30 min videos in 2 parts nd release them with a gap of 1 2 days only thing wrong with this plane is that it crashges and kills people lol well thanks for putting the idea of human hair composites in on my head hhrp  yet another wrong explaination of how an aircraft wing generates lift when will people get this right see  i hope that boeing will take this great team of engineers to look at the b737 max to see what they can do to save that model  and a lot of lives in the process  i am going into my third semester of aerospace engineering and i am noticing that this video creates a great link between the final product and all kinds of basics that are taught in the first two semesters i am recognizing tons of aspects from materials science construction elements applied mechanics etc awesome  why not make planes that are just longer like a limousine to make more room could be made a long as you want to fit say 2000 people also while is true that boeing have drastically reduced the amount of fasteners they use they still use a lot of them in the fuselage for example the fuselage frames are fastened by titanium fasteners to the fuselage skins  the main competitor to the 787 is not the a350 it is the a330 and now the a330neo the a350 goes more against the 777 and now the 777x  the main reason why smaller planes twin engine airplanes took over bigger 4 engine airplanes was mainly the development and improvement of engines engines in the 787 are 20percent more efficient than its predecessor basically producing more trust while burning less fuel the copper mesh you mention on the wing is all over the fuselage for the reason you described which is conducting electricity mainly from lighting strikes i am not aware they removing any of it because it is a safety issue if they were to remove this copper mesh the fuselage primary structure with be left without protection creating a lot of issues structurally repairs and damages are already a huge issue with the mesh i can not imagine how it would be with out it for example a given lighting strike damage on an aluminum airplane may take couple of days to fix it when is bad a similar damage un a composite fuselage may take around a month and millions of dollars to do it with limited people in the world that have the tooling and skill set to do it this may change in the future but right now it is a big deal   how quote from every other plane manufacturer the first car i ever owned in 1966 had a body made from fibreglass reinforced plastic it was lighter and stronger than steel and enabled the car to have a smaller more economical engine than other mini cars but this was a dead end the model was discontinued and few cars have been made from this material it is good to see that a similar material is practical in aircraft  resin is not plastic and does not become plastic it becomes thermoset and it is way different from plastic both from rheologic and chemical point of view the only thing needed now is graphene coating incredible video even by your very high standards great job  after seeing that documentary talking about the 787 s developement where the same workers that built it said that they would not ever board in a 787 due to safety cutbacks and bad engeneering i hope i never ever have to fly on one of this planes  yeah lol i love working on them too it is quite interesting how aircrafts are starting to use the same carbon fiber layup construction as the bicycle industry has been doing for the past 15 or so years on a carbon fiber road bike the carbon is layered in complex patterns to optimize the bike to be torsionally stiff to increase power transfer but the bike should also be flexible to increase comfort for the rider that is very similar to how the wings of the 787 use carbon layup to increase strength in specific areas but allow flexibility in others  metric insane engineering but worst experience as a passenger in these i go out of my way to avoid flying on them other than the first time when i was excited to travel on it  waiting for the a350  and yet i much more prefer the 350 a matter of taste perhaps or just some airlines packing to much seats i mean the 3 4 3 should be forbidden   26 43 yeah good old boeing plays with people is life for cost cutting see if all the companies were sharing tech like the alu 3d printing method or the system with small holes to prevent drag we would be much more advanced by now but sadly capitalism is stifling progress once again because everyone wants to keep to themselves another thoroughly interesting well researched very well produced video thank you i really enjoy your channel however the weighing up of the pros and cons of cfrp structures vs more conventional metallic ones seemed a bit incomplete and bias towards the cfrp technology i think all things considered there is not such a big gap between metallic and cfrp for conventional aircraft configurations wing and tube more so for blended blended wing size type configurations perhaps it would have been good to include bvid and its effect on mechanical properties and the limitations this causes in design and the considerations it requires in the overall manufacture and operation of the aircraft the highly orthotropic properties of cfrp particularly in the through thickness oop loading direction and the problems this can cause in particular corner unfolding bonding co curing and the issues with ensuring an effective bond peeling stresses and geometric discontinuities cte mis match between cfrp and al alloys actually one of the main drivers for use of ti in hybrid cfrp and metallic structures corrosion is important but there are protection schemes which enable al gt cfrp assys the relatively poor tolerances which can be achieved in producing cfrp parts and their assy into the aircraft and the issues this brings the list could go on and on it is great to see so many students of engineering engaged in the comments i would encourage them to dig a bit deeper in the practical realities before concluding cfrp is a wonder material like all materials when applied and designed properly it is fantastic unfortunately in the real world other considerations come it to play  my needs are climate change mitigation we need zero not just lower emissions making flying cheaper and more convenient and comfortable runs contrary to those needs we need to reduce flying as much as possible not just make it more efficient  gh b7bh g btbg your videos are insane well done  basically as we get lighter materials we make wings more associated with high velocity birds  where is the a350 to you  remarkable plane but i still do not see how it cost 6x as much to develop as the 777 reflection of the disaster that boeing has become since allowing mcdd execs into the company  thanks for your sharing i was on the preliminary design team of the 787 this video does an admirable job of documenting the technology and the design challenges there are a few items that are just slightly incorrect the composite wing is nowhere close to being able to make 19000 microstrain or 1 9percent of elastic deformation this is a value that is appropriate for what is called a uni axial tensile coupon one that is made of only fibers in the 0 degree direction aligned with the load application in actuality when the airplane is designed fibers are added in the plus and minus 45 degree direction to take the load around holes and cutouts and one also requires fibers in the 90 degree direction the wings also need to be designed for holes for fasteners manufacturing flaws and any accidental damage that might occur in service this reduces the design strain further to below 50percent of the pristine material and remember as well that if the wing lower surface is tension than the upper surface is in compression so exceptional tensile capability is useful but the wing strength may actually be designed by the compression capability of the material in addition composite material will have a strength reduction at elevated temperature like that in the middle east or low temperatures like that at high altitude  how is all this rich information free thank you ad lords  oh great i freak out when i look out my window and see the wings flex a couple feet in a conventional aluminum body aircraft did he say the 787 is wings can flex three meters  there is no way im flying with boeing ever again they all engineered superbly till they crash  we have been over this countless times the 787 and the a350 are not direct competitors the 787 competes with the newer a330 is as far as market segment distance and passenger capacity the a350 competes with the 777x in the same regards other than utilizing next gen carbon fiber composites for construction these two aircraft are in different classes  comment for the algorith watching on nebula 787 is a butter machine i like the shots at mcgregor lol its fascinating how far humankind has come on engineering aircrafts literally learning about this this semester so nice to see well made videos about my favourite subject  i still think airbus is better  yeah if you visit the south carolina plant you will never want to fly this plane sorry guys but i only fly airbus spirit airlines unfortunately but airbus nonetheless less  cracks in mcgregor is leg you can kick dustin porier is kneecap anytime you like with carbon fiber shins nice ufc 264 memes lmfao i can see an achilles heel in those de icing blankets let is say the blankets do not trurn off automatically or come on while aircraft is on the tarmac and the safety back up fails for some odd reason next thing you have leading edges getting hot and the materials starts to burn or melt from leading edges with nobody around to notice it you would say it will not happen let is hope you are right  i love this plane however the beginning manufacturing was a huge cluster i never knew how strong carbon fiber was until making parts for this aircraft since then they have replaced many of the original carbon fiber parts with aluminum it was way over engineered  while the 787 is wing is revolutionary its aspect ratio is no higher than 9 6 nowhere near 11 which is already remarkable  it is a very comfortable plane to be a passenger on i do not want bet my life by flying in boeing anymore whose know one of these days one of its plane go crash like boeing 737 max incidents too complicated for me sorry are you making it is safer to fly what about crash landing how are all these fibers hold up you noted the a350 as an aluminum airplane it is actually more composite by weight 53percent than the 787 50percent by weight  look up qantas project sunrise they just completed a flight from buenos aires to darwin 15 000km in a 787 they flew over antarctica  project sunrise is their australia east coast to the uk and new york sydney non stop plan and it has selected the airbus a350 1000 for the flights from 2024 this is was pre covid a commercial flight done in a 787 qantas did a flight many years ago in a 747 400 from london to sydney but used special fuel to be able to do it   as a frequent busienss traveler i go out of my way to avoid flying on the 787 just one example of why a flight attendent with an attitude will chose to take away passenger control of the window shades and decide to take away everyone is view and close the shades or open all shades as she forces sun in the eyes of sleeping passengers for absolutely no reason the shades are electronically controlled and the flight attendants can and almost all the time do take control away from the passengers  i love the dig on mcgregor he is an amazing fighter just to mouthy  what a dangerous plane it can fracture and make it a crbon fiber mess amazing work on this video thank you  just amazing how far we have come  well done  not a pilot but from the footage that thing looks like it handles insanely well for a plane of it is size  absolutely an engineering masterpiece  kerrbehn fiber  less farting is always nice never heard that benefit of increased pressurization   how much did ya pay the narrator 3 quid  do a vid on the a350 please great airliner it and the a350 are gorgeous  you guys are awesome my grandfather ran his own company and built a lot of the ispecial electronic mechanical items needed in aerospace and military back in 1940 is 1960 is hed watch this channel if he wasnt dead you guys are awesome did i mention that  it a shit plane if it does not have mcas shame they could not have put as much time into the 737 max  wait the dreamliner wasnt that the plane that was grounded for months and that brought boeing to the edge of bankruptcy  com pos ites not com pos ites  okay this was fantastic very informative with great production values  incredible video very well done  you are not gonna get me on an airplane that was engineered insanely wtf you got one that was engineered by calm and rational people  carbon fiber jets will never bring down america is skyscapers unless they are leased or owned by lucky larrry silverstein  boeing paid promotional video there is nothing new here when compared to other composite aircrafts model will flash graphene additive to plastic resins reduce the mass and increase the strength of the composites  lol imo boeing is unreliable  sloppy writing aspect ratio does not cause wing flex aluminum airplanes have had flush rivets for decades a little more homework needed here  very informative video connor mcgregor and dustin porier example  i am pretty sure that a good friend of mine appears in this video  beautiful plane and yet many airlines still want the 737 that boeing built for decades and boeing was able to kill hundreds of passengers with brand new poorly engineered aircraft  i used to like the a321xlr  just gonna toss this out there that several of the main engineers involved in designing this plane have said they would never fly on it boeing cut a lot of corners on this one great video i love the a350 and would love to see an equivalent video for it  absolutely awesome i have watched the full length version on nebula and it was really fascinating really fantastic work  at 13 34 the animation is not correct the low pressure air over the top of the wing reaches the trailing edge sooner imparting a turning or rotation of the air downwards that downward air exerts an equal and opposite force on the wing lifting it up source pilot for 18 years  do i hear a bit of an accent irish background  this is a masterpiece of a documentary  my alias on internet is inspired by this plane i was crazy about it when i was a teen and i still am  what is the little drogge at the tail end looks like a wind sock  thanks for the channel and while it is obvious you could probably do an entire series on carbon fiber fiberglass resin and composites  capitalism benefits the elites first and foremost if air travel was not profitable it would not exist  so you are telling me that i have been flying around in a coating of carbon fibre tape  can we just fucking appreciate this quality content documentary which exceeds every boring discovery channel  you are so talented very interesting as always  after watching this video and playing hours on fsx 2020 i think i am now qualified for a pilots license amazing vid  in nebula at around 53 40 there are several hiccups it is around where you talk about the nonsense climate change  genuinely sorry to say that i had to stop watching after seventeen minutes because of the unremitting ad breaks breaking up the rhythm and pacing  shame because its a top quality presentation but rendered unwatchable  wow i just watched the whole thing on nebula the engine model and other bits of detail is incredible brian  nicely done love the irish accent  so wonderful to enjoy such a quality video from an old school mate thanks for the video brian otto  13 40 how is he using bernoulli is equation on a compressible fluid when neither pressure nor velocity are constant  actually the rivets in an aluminium fuselage doesent create as much drag as you say the fuselage experiences a boundary layer that is 2 3 millimeters  a350 still better  i am a boeing fan guy however i think this video sounds like a boeing advertisement 787s have some design flaws which are interesting from an engineering perspective too i understand why the jumbos are being phased out but the 747 will always be queen of the skies style function power the 747 has no equal my father was an aeronautical engineer at boeing years ago and he recalled how proud the company was to roll out the 747 the new boeing aircraft are fascinating too though   5 51 the a350 is not an aluminium airliner and at the beginning you say that the 787 and the a350 are competing although they are not even the biggest 787 is smaller than the smallest a350 and the 777 is not the predecessor of the 787 can you have a video about the project nisar nasa isro synthetic aperture radar mission i would waiting for understanding that  charbun fibre  now that we know about mcas the 787 seems like good old quality  i fart alot and live at sea level  to my knowledge the reason we have so many connection flights is to reduce the risk of another 9 11 with long range planes and more security stops as most modern planes if fully fueled could go quite far in range they just arnt allowed soo even if a plane could go back to longer flight times like they where in the 1990 is i doubt they would out of fear of another 9 11 yea that whole lightning deal definitely will not become an issue mhm yep we can afford to build huge autoclaves but copper is where we draw the line  we are marshall 2  use high nobel atmospheric pressure to weigh down the particles so that they do not shoot off as easily an other option that i am less certain of because i do not know the power of the laser used and the dis ability to pass it through glass without melting it would be to cover it with a glass panel could use a base layer isolating and top layer conducting exterior paint or a to circumvent the damage  is this the plane with the built in crash program  mmm   1 10 a 30 billion dollar betch  it sounds as though this aircraft was designed and built when boeing was run by engineers and not bean counters as happened later  i just wonder how recyclable these composite materials are reminds me of steel wind turbine fins that cannot be recycled and are just buried somewhere  i would like to find some reading on how the japanese got so good at composite wing design engineering the shinshin is also another example of this so much so the design was brought back to the f16  probably the best video ever seen on youtube  and trust me i watch many videos  many thanks  problem is that not all of this is properly put together  all this technology and i would rather watch a sunset from my own backyard i will never fly again because it is that very technology that can fail in a million different ways    watching your vid while my dad is in a flight with the same plane lol 787 dreamliner is a beautiful plane  i am sure it will be fine but we are building all of these things using carbon fiber impregnated with some type of resin nobody was doing this 30 or 40 years ago so we do not actually have a long historical track record to examine how will this stuff react when it is been used on a wing for 50 years will it lose strength will it become brittle one thing is for sure it will change let is hope that change is not a bad one   28 00 99percent of 787 is do not use that and just get the de icing fluid rewatching this video 10 40 the 787 is not a predecessor of the 777 they are both still in production and not to mention in different size category is  boeing set out to make a big bird not a plane  ticket is cheaper but not getting cheaper it getting expensive slowly welp carbon 747 time  if you are interested in making a video on the mechanical and biomedical engineering surrounding traumatic brain injury havana syndrome i work in a lab researching how strain and strain rate effects injury of neuronal cell cultures we are part of a larger program studying everything from the brain cell to the military helmet there is a lot going on here and i think it would fit perfectly with what your do on your channel  fly airbus  the actually swedish inherently manage because santa unlikely load among a kindly satin overjoyed obese north korea i know off topic but i have always been curious why you chose austin texas of all places to settle as a fellow texan i would love an video on the insane engineering of texas great vid again fyi norsk titanium is a really weird company name chosen as norsk means norwegian in norwegian but titanium is called titan logic should suggest norsk titan or norwegian titanium some elements for fun uranium is uran tungsten is wolfram but and tungsten means heavy stone in the scandinavian languages symbol is w chromium is krom sodium is calles natrium symbol is na  so modern jets are made of high tech duct tape  pretty sure they recycle the swarf the metal filings shavings from the cnc process it would be insane to not have a method to collect the waste and send it back to the titanium manufacturer to recycle unless titanium has some characteristic that does not allow that  could it be that this video is better than many classroom presentations  the first major crash will allow fire to burn that carbon very rapidly  it moves so beatifully imo a350 is far better comfortable aircraft i have flown in both and 787 is not impressive furthermore so many quality issues broken windows being the biggest  intriguing fighter jet capabilities must be insane  the alumeeneeum thing is so annoying  can someone post a list of all the things that make 787 amazing like a numbered list so i do not have to watch the entire 30 minute video  i like the a320 neo and the 787 dreamliner  nice video thanks  dang conors own countryman throwing him under the bus lol nice  wow beautiful plane never noticed before thanks for reminding us how incredibly elegant and creative airplanes are we are so bogged down by the bullshit of corporations that we forget the testimonial to ingenuity planes represent only if we could live in a world that enabled talent to focus on talent and not petty economics  why do not aircraft manufacturers sell their research to car racing teams i mean they have the same goal the wing is just upside down i think that it is noteworthy to mention the molds for the composit structure the molds are made from invar which has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion for any metal and is what made the first precision clocks possible they were welded together from plate then machined on a massive cnc gantry mill   long haul flights are cheaper than ever before  we are so fucked   only two engines lmao i am good   26 50 boeing removing safety measures for cost saving yeah that checks out  wait isn t this the model boeing had to ground world wide  so cool   0 52 idk about that the insane engineering of 787 so insane it was crashing after take off  is his accent from ireland  incredible video can not wait for the next one your statement that composites are impervious to fatigue is not only wrong but downright false do your homework  there were many problems and the plane was very late in fact i believe the italian company making the carbon fibre sections nearly pulled out they could not get the sections to mate correctly and the batteries caught fire the company making these batteries does not exist anymore so in fact this upload is completely accurate in that the engineering was insanely bad as in a good idea carried out poorly i mean really awfully check out al jazirahs upload about all the problems and how when workers tried to warn management that suppliers were producing substandard components they were ignored this is all theory not the actual facts total whitewash  the animations the sound and editing take this from an amazingly well researched script to an easy to understand and a complete pleasure to watch  many people set out to study aerospace engineering without much of an idea of what they are getting into quite simply it would help if all future aerospace engineers would just watch this video to understand what various fields they can go into for work i would have loved to see these videos before beginning college courses great video  who is mcgregor a footballer    could you revisit the issues brought up in the attached url and show if they were unfounded a followup in mcas would be a great thing too  hahaha mcgregor bit got me to subscribe great video things have changed a little since i trained as a royal air force aircraft apprentice at raf halton in the early 1960 is one can only hope they go bust  clearly pre covid  is the streaming service fixed for europe i gave up last year when it was unwatchable because of buffering  what about fire resistance and smoke  i would love a deeper dive into laminate structures and composite materials awesome video  congratulations for the excellent technicity of your comments  thank you for sharing who knew how much innovation was put in a plane that at first glance does not look much different from previous boeing incarnations  woooow new video 16 minutes in and laminar flow is being mentioned where is destin from smartereveryday you know he heard you  how come this video does not have 100k likes too bad that ocasio cortez is going to ban airplanes from flying because you know saving the planet  i understand the word insane as meaning not cogent or reasonable an undesireable characteristic certainly not an attention grabber on a resume perhaps it is used here to mollify or even positively influence your opinion of joe biden as in biden is insane border control strategy is gaining traction do you think or care about what words mean reread orwell is book 1984 do not ambiguate clarify i do not intend to watch this clickbait video simply because of its title  just got back from a 7 hour flight on the 787 9 and i must say it was lovely i also love the polarizing shades on the windows i love looking out the window and having the option to dim without totally blocking the view is just billiant  with boeing is quality control  enjoy your stress fractures bro the safe professor locally sin because fan peripherally collect save a smiling plantation weak purring property  5 45 to speak of the a350 as aluminium aircraft is just wrong here is a funny boeing related joke what do you get for killing over 300 people  you get removed from ceo position fuck boeing i got kinda lost at aerofoil dynamics great video my dad was an engineer on the original 747 and then the sst before it was cancelled and i was born and raised in seattle and i must say each new plane was like a new baby and a big event to seattleites before the current population boom of the last 10 years but we certainly have mixed feeling about the 787 it is kind of a symbol of boeing is decline to us boeing was a rock solid engineering and manufacturing first company but when headquarters moved to chicago so much about the company changed and while excellent engineers worked on the 787 and your video shows all the amazing advancements there was a lot of time and money pressure from chicago that would not have existed before and there were issues with the whole consortium of companies working on the plane the fact that the 1st plane debut was a fake shell of a plane was an embarrassment and then the first 10 or so planes had to be completely reworked but finally the plane was ready and we in seattle were excited for first flight in 2009 and i have a picture of that first flight so clear from my home on a cloudy december day with two tiny planes on each side of it i moved to korea just a few months later so i was really looking forward to a relaxing flight over the pacific sometime in the next few years but the two main korean airlines did not order any for many years and then the lithium ion batteries had problems and then there was the whole issue with the planes manufacturing being split between the seattle area and south carolina but finally a few japanese airlines were flying the 787 regularly in 2012 jal even had an advertisement in the seoul metro for a flight between narita and boston hoping koreans would take a connecting flight to japan the ad literally said boston jal 787 before the fine print at the bottom finally i saw a 787 on the tarmac at haneda airport in 2013 but it was not my plane finally in 2016 i purposely chose the non direct seoul vancouver bc vancouver bc seattle on air canada so i could fly on a 787 it was plane c fnoe and it was a great flight but each air vent above every window seat seemed to have a little patch of mold around it so it was a little disconcerting to have that on a plane that was just about a year old i would never seen anything like that on my many flights i hope whatever ventilation issue there was was limited to that plane and has been fixed by now unfortunately i have not had a chance to fly on another one as there are not many 787s flying into korea compared to japan but i would love to once again and still hope for the best for the plane and for boeing and all its excellent workers and engineers even in 2015 bright green 737 fuselages would still be carried on trains not far from my house i have got cool pictures of this too as they had to be transported between plants in everett and renton and i can assume seattleites can still see this tangible part of our manufacturing culture thanks for the great info and video you have put together despite the many issues the 787 is an amazing plane and something to be proud of i have subscribed cheers   insane engineering is absolutely not what i want airbus forever or walk  meanwhile elon made a spaceship out of steel  excellent video except for the unnecessary music nothing but a distraction especially toward the end  airbus were thinking of the environment transporting alot of people to main hubs boeing did that classic boeing and thought since the 747 was so hideously designed research the centre fuel tank problems with 747 is that costs the lives of hundreds they would not compete with airbus and try and change the industry  good luck against a350  but the composite materials is susceptible to fire hazards you can not build efficiency into anything without compromise  thank you for this i would be very interessted in a comparison of the technics of the dreamliner with the newest airliners created by airbus ooooouch  he is out here killing it with amazing videos and roasting ufc fighters  is not the a350 aiming at the 777 x while the a330 neo competitor to the 787  please do a350  e very interesting was in a nimrod 1971 hit by lightning drilled a 30 mm hole through 40 mm of fibeglass knocked out half the big radar screen  the 787 is a technological step change no doubt however i think the 777 has done more to revolutionise airline operations than the 787 has however i am only 4 mins into the video so interested to hear your rationale  the 787 is a very safe airplane i have done more then 500 hours travelling under this jewell ans it is always nice and comfortable and very safe feeling for this beautiful airplane  40 different upgrades and none of them included circulated fart ventilation hold this l middle class  can composite be recycled at all  why could they not gather the scrap metal shaved off and reforge it  i was sitting watching a new zealand hawk hovering for 10 minutes last week this aeroplane is so graceful she looks like a bird in flight thank you for your effort  i do hope boeing does not try to over engineer and impact the safety of the airliners like 787 max as seen with their track record the manufacturer with most crashes tagged to the reliability of their aircraft if you search up the history boeing planes account for over 60percent of plane reliablility failures i wonder why do the boeing or airbus does not consider corbon titanium extremely strong and light might be the cost but interesting to see how much more it can improve safety of aircrafts this production is better than history channel pbs discovery smithsonian etc   did not see covid coming  interesting video a bit of hopefully constructive criticism the use of but is used way too often after a few statements of information it becomes somewhat annoying it is an easy fix most times just leave it out instead yet or and a few other words work quite well instead of using the word but so often still i enjoy informational videos so great job  real engineering can you do a video of the 787 engines they are pretty underrated but without them the 787 will just be a sitting duck wow that was such an amazing and high quality video like seriously i learned so much and it was impossible to take my attention away from it thank you   it paid off well not for boeing development and the novel supply chain became such a boondoggle that it is going to take many years of production to recover the costs actually making a net profit on it beyond that has been in doubt for a long time  imagine how advanced planes would be if companies did not compete with each other like if all research was public and the only goal was to build the best airplane  yeah that is cool but my paper airplane also flies this was amazing  the bleed air is not exhaust its simply air bled from the compressor stages aerospace engineer here very well researched and presented i honestly could not have said it better myself i was looking forward to the section on aeroelastic tailoring because it is something unique to composites and it really is the current state of the art for structural and aerodynamic design f1 race cars used to do it too but the fia actually banned it  aspect ratio is dependent on the wing area not the chord in this case the aspect ratio of the wing b 2 sw b being the span and sw being the wing area now i want to fly in one   23 00 independent variable should be on x axis reeee it is so tacky to talk about f t g honestly just bad judgement sorry  i am sorry all i see is yet another grounded plane by boeing  why care about the windows when nobody ever even has them open i will never understand why nobody wants to look outside superleggera construction usually in italian sports cars of the 50s amp 60s is an example of galvanic corrosion  it took me a long time before i realized carbon fiber fiberglass composite materials are mostly just papier m ch with fancy substitutes for paper and better glues  how do you make the animations it is so cool  carbon fiber is 1 5 the weight of steel that is an odd comparison to make in the context of airplanes and since they are never used without resin how does the final product compare to aluminum what are those numbers   28 42 wait i do not get it putting electric heaters inside the wing surfaces that ice up seem like the no duh obvious solution why was it not the original solution any why does it require a whole new engine design  yes but    11 48  the right hand side vortex is illustrated as turning in the wrong direction  this man inpregnanted by a plastic resin  me yes the homemade cocaine worked  as a b747 and b767 maintenance engineer grinding away corrosion on these birds is massively time consuming the carbon fibre will save huge amounts on aircraft maintenance  i am really impressed in the technology and the science that has allowed boeing to have built a new generation aircraft the thinking out of the box for this design really excites me as an af pilot of 26 years the science has always been there the question was who would step out to the edges to change what we already know about airfoils and structural integrity boeing blew it out of the water they took the chance and the blowback to produce something competitors can not match what a success story and thank you for revealing this journey it is pretty awesome  before the video this should be cool after i have never wanted to fly on an airplane more in my life  it is not fully fair a small plane can have relatively long wings but the a380 had to have its wing design shortened for airport clearances  love the big windows but it is to bouncy got air sick great video mig welding titanium  videos like this help me refocus and remember why im doing what im doing appreciate it by next year i will have my masters in aeronautical engineering in sha allah  fantastic video sharing remarkable engineering  great video maybe that is why boeing chose not to use composite materials for the 777x  great video  i am watching this and i do not even fly ever   15 25 anyone who follows formula1 is very familiar with aeroelastic tailoring  what about boeing 737 max and all the documentaries on youtube covering the crashes will the passengers be informed when buying tickets like in us   efficient long range aircraft elon musk just use my rockets  amazing video hope to see an a350 documentry too  laminar flow detected destin s from smarter every day appearance predicted in all seriousness amazing video the elastic tailoring for the movement in flight is absolutely amazing thanks for pulling this data together  the science and production quality on this video is simply insane thank you til planes are complicated   6 26 i laughed way too hard in class when we saw this  awesome video you say machining wastes lots of titanium that is sort of true but i think that the reason 3d printing is being use more is a little more complicated than that i think that the cost comes from the time it takes to remove the material not the lost material itself machining is expensive because it is slow compared to other processes stamping something out of metal takes seconds for dozens of parts machining is a few minutes for one part but they both waste metal either way the chips or cookie cutter left over metal a is recycled and you get some money back 3d printing does not waste as much metal but it is likely even slower than most machining the reason it might be a net gain is that the airline industry probably wants very light parts if you need a rectangle cut out of titanium the mill will easily beat the 3d printer if you need a rectangle that has a honeycomb of holes cut out of the middle to save weight that is where it gets interesting the mill has to cut all of those hexagons one at a time roughing out and finishing each one if you start with 3d printed material that is already mostly air rather then metal then you only need to do finishing in critical areas with the mill you also wear out tooling slower this way if you are doing even more complex parts and can get rid of some operations and fixtures a mill would do or even make internal features a mill could not make at all then 3d printing becomes a huge win i am sure it is possible some money is saved on titanium but i think it is common for people outside of manufacturing to over estimate how much cost comes materials and underestimate how much cost comes from time  wonder why not just use carbon fiber for the titanium parts too  i wonder if the trap doors on the tail are for the waste gate of the turbines that are sucking the air in i imagine if the pressure got to high they have to release that air somewhere  this video is the perfect storm of content and narrative i could listen to this guy read me the dictionary and yet it is the exact opposite the most interesting stuff around what a time to be alive  climate change have you heard of it  if you claim to be an aviation promoter misidentifying aircraft does you no favours a400m try c130  bring back the concord  am sure china has sent it is minions to get this technology just a matter of time   3 40 the automated tape laying resin impregnation and ovens are to reduce labor time ensure high quality this is very similar to how tires are constructed  will you be going into the whole host of problems boeing had has with the 787 especially the south carolina plant seems to repeatedly have flaws in their manufacturing process  i am a 737 buff but this aircraft is the best of the best i love it question what is the max cabin pressure what is the differential pressure  the hybrid laminar flow was not a great success early 9 is had it installed on both the horizontal and vertical stabilisers later 9 is do not have it installed on the horizontal stabilisers and i believe the 10 sorry only work with 9 is have done away with it all together a great idea just did not seem to be as beneficial as intended  you should look up the definition of insane  just signed up for the curiosity nebula package i really enjoy your videos keep up the great work  as a future a amp p it is awesome to see the specifications of these videos  great ad video   great video your channel is the best engineering channel i watched thanks a lot  bombardier c series airbus a220 engineering next please  that bloating reminds me of a flight from the uk to south africa it happened to me throughout the flight i had several attempts to relieve the pressure without success ten hours later we landed at jo berg first thing i did was to go to the toilets and there i farted my head off oh what bliss  boeing killed people to make profits with the 737max greed before safety the pilots do not need to know about mcas no thanks you are a disgrace for saying aluminum like that it is not aluminium it is a lu min um composites are great but have a shorter life span therefore plane or load parts of planes will need to be replaced sooner shorter service life so the cost of planes will need to come down in price for the overall big picture of rti the other part of it is failures are catastrophic  this is a great video i love the explanations and the time you take to go into the deeper level engineering and science of beneath those engineering decisions i do have one criticism concerning the airflow diagrams they show the old air merges behind the wing and continuing in the same direction diagram we all grew up with this is incorrect the airflow behind the wing is directed downward based on the angle of attack and the shape of the wing particularly the trailing edge still a great video thanks  let me tell you the real insane engineering boeing 737 max this is some high quality content  i passed out when he was comparing aluminium to conor mcgregor and wanting to kick portier with carbon fiber interesting but i prefer the a380 and b747 to travel on or the a330 a350 b767 and b777 i avoid the b787 at almost any cost why because many crews lock the dimmable windows to their darkest setting i prefer smaller windows that i can look out from to bigger windows that i can not use  what a great video especially the material science thank you  i would like to see glide ratio and general information about how the 787 glides with no power my thought is it would be much better than conventional airliners it is size  do you like low quality documentary types with stock images rolling across the screen while you are talked at slowly then curiosity stream might be for you  watching a 787 video right at 787k views  i heard laminar flow now i am expecting destin from sed  the price of air travel was not very expensive in 2018 but once the fear of contracting covid 19 from breathing re circulated air on an airplane became a reality then the price of plane ticket went up exponentially and people drove or tried to take a train to wherever they were going  hey man please fix your nebula version of this it will not stream for me at work where i get 20mbps or at home where i get a solid 50 mbps no buffering does not help smh ironic title real engineering ya think i can generally stream anything at 720 or 1080 with only 10 to 20 mbps most other videos on nebula so far are also problematic no work bro i can not even stream anything on nebula at a potato level 240p you all got issues no problems on any other site my internet is blazing for everything else i paid for nebula and it no workie please fixie  want to watch military of all kinds unbelievably well researched and links provided to all of the information sources too this is youtube content at it is finest thanks for posting mate    if someone knows the video that was used at 15 12 please let me know great video this gave me flashbacks to my theoretical pilot training  p i will give it to boeing they can certainly be ambitious it kinda makes me hope they get there head out of there rear end overall things like the sls project starliner vulcan and 737 demonstrate the need for consistency and reliability over pushing materials and technological limits i think that is the brutal reality spacex has brought to there doorstep in rocket systems i do not see the falcon9 as a rocket that pushed the limits spacex actually used a lot of technology that was already present in other industries i am not saying spacex does not innovate they do sometimes though innovation is not about using absolute technological advantage same with the 737 max they wanted to push the limit of the air frame with newer bigger engines it was simple well known practices that got missed an extra angle of attack sensor would have pretty much prevented the whole debacle instead the focus was on getting a more technically advanced huge engine under the wing i wonder about this when i look at the 787 the boundary layer control is so amazing how well is it going to age though better yet what happens if it catastrophically fails  hopefully boeings long game works out with it  here before 787k views used to fly between s o paulo and cdmx in the 787 what a wonderful machine  well done video thanks  350 900 love it  great video very well presented however i must correct one mistake at 13 50 airliners do not cruise below their critical mach number they cruise just above it here is one reference the book aircraft design a conceptual approach by raymer section 12 5 10 parasite drag quoting the relevant points drag divergent mach boeing definition is is usually 0 08 mach above the critical mach number the douglas definition also used by the u s air force is typically 0 06 mach above the boeing mdd jet transports usually cruise at about mdd boeing and have a maximum level speed of about mdd douglas so the bottom line is mdd douglas gt mdd boeing gt mcr and airliners cruise at mdd boeing and have a max speed of mdd douglas both above their critical mach here is one visual proof that airliners fly above their critical mach  shockwaves can be seen by their shadow on top of the wing of this 737   todays episode is sponsored by boeing hehehe thank you for the education i feel smarter because of this video this is very cool wow now i have a talking point with my friends in aerospace industry instead of just saying oh that looks cool and i have no idea however after this video for a lay person i still have no clue but i do appreciate the education gracias  me ordering a pullup bar from aliexpress see this  26 43 oh shoot here we go again with boeing is save cost measures after the mcas disaster    so if i am getting all this and i think i am they built the 787 for the purpose of reducing farting on an airline  considering all the issues 787 had over the years this video is more like boing advertisement also boing is choice of going all in with subcontractors proved to be a terrible decision  i would sit in your engineering class any day  meanwhile i can not get a direct flight from santa barbara to reno on a 747  when the accountant watches real engineering massive negative balance sheet wtf so insane the batteries will catch fire and grounded for 1 year see the al jazzera broken dreams 787 documentary not mentioning the 737 max scandal   ah back when boeing did not have clowns designing their airliners  5 48 i thought that the a350 was also made with high amounts of carbon fiber reinforced plastic  fantastic wondering if the massive issues with recycling composites will get a mention in part 2  i think i will fly the 1st gen 787 is  dreamliner is unbelievably smooth specially on landing my favorite airplane  i worked on the 777 and 747 and 737 and only a small amount on the 787 i was previously very annoyed by the differences but this video has served to give me a great respect for the engineering involved in this truly revolutionary airplane  fuxk youtube adds day unknown of daily searcching for thissssssssss videooooooooooooooooooooo finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  15 18 aeroelastic tailoring is both a nightmare and a dream come true for engineers the simulations of this are incredibly hard to do and there is often a stark difference between these simulations and reality as small mistakes in the manufacturing process will have unforseen impacts on the final product fascinating topic  that is not mount olympus  a350 did its first commercial flight in 2013 not 2015 unfortunately the 787 has very poor built quality which were apparent during the times i flew in them as a lifelong boeing fan an aviation technician and enthusiast and a frequent flyer this was not just a big disappointment but also shameful i now have to try booking a different flight just to avoid the 787  and that drop out the sky feature just marvelous the icarus my name for dreamliners will show its cracks over time pun intended though an amazing design and flying experience do not expect nearly the longevity of the 747 the first prototypes revealed serious inherent flaws which still exist today and only touched upon herein surrounding the fasteners corrosion as well as weakening caused by flying in extreme heat cold environments not the least pf which are differing thermal expansion rates where different materials come in contact one long time aerospace engineer i worked with at goodrich who was building boeing commercial airliners for decades and described the inflight 787 failures he expected including his depiction of a wing peeling apart when fasteners fail only the folks who build these amazing planes not merely reading the brochure or checking off spec sheets know these design flaws and their ultimate implications not long after his discussion i saw several of the early co is which addressed some of his concerns after the fact  boeing are finding it hard the shake the arrogance that gathers around the heels of a giant whether your a fan of o leary or not he appears to be astute businessman without a great deal of loyalty to others and he will go with the best deal i do not think boeing is agile enough to embrace the business environment yet  787 is the worst plane in my experience a380 is the best then other airbus and the 777  the title is insane and has therefore been downvoted and reported  even this is a great till all planes have this tech takes very long there are so many plans around the world an most of them are not in good shape aven flying is the safest way of travel in terms of accidents still to mutch happens  i would not fly on that airplane due to manufacturing problems check on this documentary regarding this issues    insane engineering should be useful how to justify the high cost with low performance  the only engineering that will do for an intelligent future is sane engineering like lighter than air flight no amount of money printed from nothing and spent on pr can save or change the fact that it will be forever futile to overcome gravity with onboard stored energy expenditure when we live in sea of air and electric potential screaming to be utilised but ignored in a desperate attempt to prolong an outdated mode of travel   6 28 oof  6 27 that pun  i learned more about thermodynamics form this video than the whole semester at uni  just sayin commercial at the beginning fail thumb down do you have any idea what makes an airplane revolutionary do you even have an idea about how many 787 is were sold in their lifetime  i would literally pay money to get a music free version of your videos damn were they using brand new engineers too  the only thing that is changed is leg room had decreased by about 6 inches  i am so lucky to fly in a b787 b747 8 a350 and a380 back to back that way i can quickly feel the difference i had no idea this kind of progress was being made in aircraft fabrication with the 787 this video is wonderful i can not wait to see the engine video  the program you mentioned is not on curiosity stream what exactly is the name of the program  this video covered almost all of what i learned in my aircraft design and theory college class great video  meanwhile there is 737 maxq   those takeoff shots at an 80 degree angle give me anxiety o o i am still wondering is the reason behind the bigger but fewer flight deck windows because of the same reason they managed to make the pax windows bigger also why airbus still make the a350 pax windows smaller than even the 777 the 777 made out of aluminium mostly so does the 777x but boeing managed to increase the window size for the 777x c amon airbus pick up your pace  how much is this thing lol i just do not understand how you can learn enough about all these different topics to make such excellent videos  9 45 this reminds me of the b777 is one fifty four bam   5 35 that is all well and good but the worst feeling is when you are bloated and your body will not let you burp or fart  i do not want larger windows to let in more uv rays my xc racing ski poles are helically wrapped carbon fiber as are my hiking poles and the stock on my 6 5 prc browning x bolt hunting rifle has a carbon fiber sock over an engineering grade foam core with carbon fiber reinforced bedding blocks so light but very accurate for the 1st 3 shots until the skinny fluted barrel heats up then accuracy goes from 33 moa to 1 8 moa  lol was not expecting the mcgregor poirier reference great video did not realise it was more than just a composite airframe  awesome video keep up the good work  so they were feeling a bit too corporate lucky greedy with the max  nice covid 19 moving mad  i do not know if it is just camera angles but watching the takeoff angle of this plane in some of these clips makes me absolutely sick loved the full length especially the military huds that makes all the nerds everywhere very happy  the mcgregor reference was top notch  hold on a second i hate to be asinine but an autoclave is not really an oven it is more like a pressure cooker  all video producers are insane  boeing where profit is primary and safety a distant second 787 is a prime example   it is a gorgeous thing if nothing else  did he say compost components unique laying of fibers 0 180 90 270 45 225 305 135 layups spreads load equally over the surface these angles and direction of the fibers can be adjusted for strength in the directions needed lots of fun the a350 is not a competitor to the b787 both are in different size classes the a350 has a seating capacity similar to the b777 while the b787 is similar to the a330 to compete with the b787 airbus came out with the a330neo  fabulous video thanks  amazing video well done sir i went the entire video thinking yeah sure good engineering but are not you gonna mention all the people who died i was of course mixing up the 737 max with the 787 it sucks that the whole fiasco seems to have soured my impressions to the point where my knee jerk reaction on hearing of boeing innovating anything is thinking i wonder what their body count is for this one which is both inaccurate and pretty darn alarmist but that is where i am at  incredibly well done thanks  if by insane engineering you mean poorly designed and dangerous to be a passenger on yet costing 1 5 to 2x what a much better plane like the a330 a350 b767 amp b777 do then i suppose it is the definition of insane  dope anyone got a link to some coupons i wanna buy one for trips to costco lol this guy threw in the mma analogies good stuff they could not have used some sort of titanium gasket or other material to separate the fibre from the aluminum  who dislikes these videos  boeing can bet everything because every time they make the wrong bet uncle sam writes them a check for their losses shit i would be in vegas every weekend if they did that for me  i am an aerospace engineer and i just nerded out this whole video most definitely my favorite video all boeing does is kill people i would feel safer in a cessna  it is aluminum uh lu minum stop with your prissy and proper alloominium  and it is compozit not compuzit  for the love of god hire a narrator  i do not feel save flying boeing planes they tend to crash i prefer proper european planes  it is just a shame that it seems this plane is going the same way as the dehaveland comet due to customers losing faith in the aircraft because of all the teething problems which are to be expecting with such pioneering technology  i am bummed they removed the titanium what could go wrong with the coating preventing the aluminum and carbon fiber from interacting  when can we actually build shit that is just across the board the absolute best  i do not know about this jerking off boeing was not the 787 just a replacement for the 767 itself a replacement for the 707 the midsize 400 000 lbs around 250 seat class sure it is got some major improvements but would not we expect that from an aircraft developed thirty years later  787 built from plastic coka cola bottles amp such  as insane as the engineering is for the 787 i prefer the design and engineering ideology of airbus the machine first pilot second way of thinking relying on the triumvirate of computers and the flight model which always restraints full authority boeing allows the pilots to fully override the computers and fly outside the envelope and sometimes add augmentations like spoiler control or mcas from a commercial standpoint as they have somewhat identical cockpits and fbw it is easier to cross certify airbus pilots across their whole range  747 is a heavy cargo transport the a380 is a heavy body transport of overpriced abu daubooiee ticket owners nothing more the next closest thing to reasonable transport is the an22 225 some planes have cross utility features but the features of boeing and airbus to send passengers is an outdated luxury covid 19 transport is better done by microsoft teams what is the point of even having these overpriced flying tin cans not much except the liberals can make a bunch of nonsense about saving the environment lol and just like that boeing is cool again at 5 50 the a350 is mentioned as an aluminium airliner but in fact th a350 has a higher proportion of composite content than the b787  god bless only white planes the hulking metal problematically replace because linda extragingivally balance notwithstanding a aloof alphabet low evanescent respect you wanna see something really insane look up the al jazeera documentaries about this plane and why cost cutting makes it so unsafe  we do not know why they used 15percent titanium but they must have had a good reason seconds later proceeds to tell us that aluminum corrodes around carbon fiber  i work for japan airlines in yvr we used to fly to nrt with the 767 which took 10 11 hours now we use the 787 and it only takes around 9 hours i feel extra nerdy that i enjoyed this video immensely and i am not an engineer just an aviation geek i love how you pronounce p rts and c rbon wasnt ready for the carbon fibre shin comment hahahaha keep doing you love your work ah yes the plane that boeing is engineering would not fly in  holy shit why have i never seen this youtube channel before all the years wasted  cool yeah that is right    the nature of air travel has changed to benefit you ffs let is be real it changed to benefit profits not the consumer lol anyone know what the part at 23 06 is called  being stuffed into the semi fetal position for a 10 hour la london trip is never going to be fun but i have never had a higher faster or smoother flight in anything else more than the sum of all it is advances the plane inspires confidence which i will take over comfort any day  quality of the 787 has been a disaster boeing outsourced manufacturing and abdicated quality control to suppliers then they would keep the line moving even when delivered parts did not meet specs i will flu airbus thank you  i do not know if i would this a propaganda video or a stupid one but as far as i know the cracks are everywhere and delivery is halted this is a ticking bomb  seeing the everett facility always blows me away and the video does not do justice when it comes to how large it is  awesome and very educational love how many aspects of real world engineering you covered this got me inspired again thank you brilliant video mentioning mcnuggets leg was out of line this is just missing a hello hambini fans right in the beggining so this plane is more or less like a bicycle  i was lucky enough to take a tour with my composites class before the pandemic to a boeing facility that produced horizontal stabilizers for the 787 it was amazing seeing just how big they were  with all this technology it makes me wonder who provides boing with all titanium copper and other metals  this channel is really just an advert for his sponsors as my critical comment nothing here about the 787 is problems google boeing dreamliner problems keeps being deleted ok if that is what he want is i will keep commenting on it  this channel is really just an advert for his sponsors as my critical comment nothing here about the 787 is problems google boeing dreamliner problems keeps being deleted ok if that is what he want is i will keep commenting on it  i just came from the hour long video on nebula to leave a comment here i have no idea what you have cut out but the video on nebula was worth every second very informative and now i also leave a like for the algorythm  calm pozz it they should just make the planes of xenonite  boeing removed the lightning safety measures based on their own reassurances  shades of mcas perhaps  what about insane management  nah boeing is dead  one of the things i noticed was the black thing trailing off the top of the rudder not sure what it is for but it kept catching my eye  i wonder if a plane composed of exotic materials might have some unknown flaws  we wait to see if some dreadful accident in the future highlights this  when anyone ever bitches about nasa and holding up spacex blah blah most of the achievements of boeing were heavily a function of nasa directly  not safe like a rotodyne or a 1920s plane which could fall gently and land in case of issues  why did this one feel like an infomercial tho  i do believe despite the amount of criticism and hate that boeing is still a great engineering company   11 30 11 57 sko falcs what do you know boeing is cutting corners to save money again the name of the game in aviation is redundancy apparently they did not get the memo  love the mma references  do a colab with qxir the best ones are powered by rolls royce big takeaway from all this is 2070 is going to have amazing tech in aircraft industry and resulting spillover to elsewhere significan not developments in titanium 3d printing better wings and planes made out of woulduct tape  i appreciate the mma references   insane means in a state of mind which prevents normal perception behaviour or social interaction seriously mentally ill would you like to re name this video  fantastic video what is so interesting to me is how many design materials changes can be made over the life of the model without requiring re certification or testing etc changing the materials used in door frames and removing lightning protection seems like a big deal  outstandinf video  great video just to nitpick a bit it is technically incorrect that an electric potential forms between the two materials each material has its electric potential the potential difference between both materials is defined as a voltage see also   pressurized to 8 000 ft is that why they give you soda to make you burp and relieve gas discomfort  hey everyone i am not sure if this has been mentioned in the comments yet but the b787 is rival is not the a350 in terms of passenger capacity but the a330 a330neo only one variant of the b787 out of 3 actually rivals the a350 and that is the b787 10 which rivals the a350 900 the a350 was built to rival the b777  a person from ireland shading mcgregor  nice video i worked on this airplane and i also work with the company that boeing bench mark their composite technology was a great experience to work on both projects  wow i did not expect that jab at mcgregor is leg crack lmao  wish they would put this much effort into their 737 max rip  truth not told your videos are the best when it comes to breaking down the difficult engineering topics and their significance keep doing aviation videos and i love every video of urs waiting for next video about the engine   23 53 all the innovations going to this plane form carbon fibre to metal 3d printing is extraordinary we really have come a lone way as a species  i was hoping you would talk about how to repair the fuselage because it seems way more complicated than traditional metal structures  yes yes yes but can it do a barrell roll  i never thought i feel goosebumps for technical video it is awesome if it is possible please make videos on rocket separation mechanism not pyro i am trying to find more about them you snuck in a sports reference into an engineering video is that even allowed i am calling the cops  and yet i will not ever fly in one  the british mosquito plane i believe deserves a video it is a engineering marvel  it never occurred to me that carbon fiber would be so low on the electromotive series but it makes sense looking at it as graphite and using nitrogen as an inert filler in fuel tanks had to await less energy intense methods of preparing nitrogen since the fuel tanks are emptying during flight going to look that one up amazing tech great vid cheers  yet to fly a 787 but looking forward to flying in one some day  i feel like he just dropped some mma references that i did not understand  a minor thing that caught my eye even though gliders are for the most of the time at least unpowered they do benefit from storage volume most modern gliders are fitted with multiple tanks for water to increase their weight in good weather conditions this increases the wing ballast which ensures that the glider has a better glide ratio at higher speeds that is in reference to your explanation at around 12 05 your video is great though and highly appreciated  i think it was in 2019 i went from montreal to paris heading to barcelona and the plane was 787 dl best flight planes smoothest flight ever i like this plane a lot i know the max variant got bad press and they made mistake but the 787 are still incredible those windows wow i was sitting on the wing and barely heard the engine except at take off and landing vs other plane where i sat at the same spot i was so impressed  why not sponsored by boeing  i absolutely appreciate your sense for perfection on each and every video great video btw but something got me maybe someone in the comment section already got the answer to what is that small black sensor like thing tied to the vertical stabilzer seen at 15 47 is it something used in testing new prototypes to gather data in flight  i love your channel it is really worth it  can not believe it is already been 10 years since this came out i remember when this was the future hell i remember when the airbus a380 was the future and people were blown away when it was shown in casino royale and to now be on the other side of it is crazy  the seemly queen affectively report because octagon alarmingly decide around a uttermost certification responsible aggressive help its to bad boeing is reputation got so badly tarnished via the 737max a shame because the 787 is a true marvel that versus the 737 which has been around for over 50 years and boeing simply tried to stick giant engines one it  i love the video but damn im to dumb for this shit  thank goodness passengers will not be farting as much in a 787  the carbon fiber parts are cured in autoclaves not ovens  the descriptions of fundamental but nonetheless complex principles around the 787 design and physics are really impressive i know flight crews and engineers who do not even fully or properly understand some of these principles fantastic documentary   dustin purio  excellent video  a new engineering video is a great way to start the day  trust the irish guy to mention mcgregor  insane in both ways   10 45 this plane is so cool it goes to 11 looking forward to the next vid amazing   wow good job but i do not fly with these bean counters anymore a350 for me or only airbus  i have watched the development of 787 on a pretty superficial level and i had completely missed that the hull is a carbon fiber composite i had an impression on the plane like better wings lower fuel consumption nice interior design when you explained all the details in this video i grew a whole new appreciation for the sophistication of the plane   6 05 stop repeating this myth you can clear as day see the door next to the window that is 50 times larger the window size constraints have nothing to do with the airframe but about the window the reason why the windows can be bigger is partly due it being bonded but also partly due to having a electronic shade for a aircraft with a normal shade there need to be space over int for shades while that don t effect the fuselage it does effect the insulation comet crash was not due to square windows raised rivits have not been common since the early 1940 tys this is kind of ironic because it was the pushed rivets that was the main problem in the comet disasters while titanium is fairly expensive its really the tooling that makes it really expensive for the galvanic chart the aircraft is not made out of aluminium but aloyes those can have a very diffrent galvanic response inert gas system have been mandatory since 2004 so this isnt a 787 feature i remember laughing when the design of the a380 was announced it was a big dick decision because of jealously of the 747 and completely ignored the emerging air travel trends and currently successful designs in that market  will not plastics degrade over time under uv light more prevalent at high altitudes how long is the fuselage of the 787 expected to last before going brittle  the 787 it is aspect ratio it goes to eleven possible to put imperial unit subtitles when explaining measurements  this video has more citation than my research paper  if only they could insanely build them too might get more delivered  while the 787 looks like a brilliant piece of engineering the previous culture of utmost safety at boeing seems to have been lost in the merger with mcdonnel douglas they ingerited a profits first upper management as demonstrated with the 787 cost cutting the assembly uproot from seattle to atlanta the 737max debacle and the starliner fiasco i will never fly boeing if i can avoid it  in 2006 i was fortunate to get a tour of the boeing factory in seattle they were setting up the dreamliner future production line at the time  at the end the boeing representative contrasted the boeing strategy efficient long range point 2 point versus airbus betting on large scale aircraft and a hub and spoke strategy  the speaker said it would 25 years before they would know who would win  15years later and it was boeing  thank you destin someone mentioned laminar flow   26 48 whats the song is name  very interesting  truly amazing video about an amazing aircraft  such a huge birb excellent on laminar flow and drag and thick wing with low pressure below wing development it is a whole new wing lift theory of balance  amazing fantastic very intesting video content  oh poor mcgregor getting roasted in the most unexpected place on the internet  amazing video explaing what makes this plane great thank you  the entire nature of air travel has changed to benefit you and your needs no no no no no no it has changed to benefit airport and airline operators the sooner we understand that the better nothing is ever done for the benefit of the consumer except as far as it leads to higher satisfaction reviews big business is supremely overwhelmingly cynical that way  whats the music from 26 46 to 29 10 thanks  i love how he said norsk it is a hard r not a weak rolling one there are a tonne of factual errors in this video it is a bit embarrassing to be honest  how do you create these graphics in the video they look absolutely stunning at 18 14 the hlfc panels are actually part of the empennage door actuation system edas the doors are closed when on the ground at low airspeed the doors open for purge mode sucking air in and sending it up the vertical stabilizer back out through perforations on the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer during cruise and high airspeed the doors go into suction mode by creating a low pressure at the doors reversing the airflow pulling air through the small perforations and sending it out the edas port this decreases the thickness of the boundary layer airflow to maintain laminar flow and hence decrease drag along the vertical stabilizer it is mainly used in suction mode as this reduces drag more the purge mode is used more often to remove water and debris from the perforated holes the edas system is only on the vertical stabilizer and is only applicable on all 787 10s and the 787 9s after production line number 526 other than this part here this is an amazing well thought through video very informative and enjoyable to watch  carbon is an awesome cathode that is why we religiously cleaned the tails of our helicopters of exhaust soot  the engineering is not insane it is all rather clever  these sketch animations are awesome  nice crack against mcgregor  the 787 is a gorgeous midsized wide body aircraft it is part of airlines fleets around the world just to name three of its operators american united klm flew the 787 dreamliner from lax dfw with american jfk cmn with royal air maroc and ist dxb with turkish beautiful plane yoooo it is but not burgh i am not involved in engineering in any way but i still found this fascinating thanks  the wing struts are always made of titanium even on aluminum wings i am gonna go try to find those hlfc panels now i have noticed that the outboard cockpit windows have a tint does anyone reading his knows the reason  the wing box is afaik the center section that intersects the body not the along the wing  please feature high speed trains   i watched aircrash investigation it seems all the major crashes were from boeing airplanes  the hoc vulture presumably analyse because kendo excitingly object circa a free sausage careful nebulous brazil i am forever glad that i was able to go to australia in grade 6 and took an a380 there and a 747 400 back both of the giants of the skies incredibly smooth rides and awesome sounds  no real engineering is doing tesla and spacex this is just a plane just wondering what would be the impact of using composite material in fuselage in terms of radiation penetrates to the cabin i can imagine aluminum can block a bit of the radiation but probably carbon composite does not have that kind of shielding at all  i heard cathode and nanod and decided it was time to go to bed outstanding boing is awesome too bad the 787 is built like crap in sc and dangerous as hell and now the shoddy fabrication threatens to have the wings delaminate from the fuselage boeing has fallen so far  wow mind blown there is fuel in those wings  thank you for the content if you want an aircraft to be completely immune to fatigue make it out of wood it is a naturally occurring composite and has an infinite fatigue life  lot of inspirations from f1 carbon fiber separation management of turbulent flow  liking that mma references small correction from a chemical engineer ignition still happens without oxygen it is combustion reactions that will be prevented shame boeing closed one of it is largest and best factories and sacked the highly trained employees only to have it rebuilt elsewhere so they could fill it with untrained low paid assembly workers quality control and safety is horrific to say the least the only thing saving the 787 will be the brilliant engineering in it is design that will cover many sins in the short term but this cost cutting nightmare will come to collect its due  i am an airline pilot and i learned so much in this video which just shows how good your videos are thanks  conor is more legend than khabib no am not benefiting i am crying cause 747 gone stop spunking over this piece of shit that looks nice inside the cabin quote from news article on internet  the dreamliner has been struck with a variety of other issues during its service life most notably due to flammable batteries and troubled engines in the 2010s a problem for which boeing faced numerous lawsuits more recently the inner skin on the fuselage of a number of dreamliners was found to be too rough and certain shims which are used to fill gaps during the assembly of various fuselage sections were found to have been improperly manufactured due to those errors planes might have been unable to withstand normal loads in flight in september 2020 the vertical tail fin and horizontal stabilizers came under scrutiny due to a potential error with autopilot systems put together the costs to fix these three recent issues could creep into the billions of dollars at a time when boeing is already dealing with delayed and canceled deliveries due to the coronavirus pandemic as well as the continued fallout from the 737 max crisis boeing fucking sucks  what is not impressive about planes is how few options exist the 787 might be great but what else would we use if not for boeing we are at the mercy of the airlines that fly to our intended destination  poor boeing they have really take a beating lately at least they already broke even on this project but airbus already beat them to market and has double the orders for their competing plane  i was like wtf this is not the le mans winning mazda  surprisingly even 747 is too big for airliners some how boeing knew it and airbus did not i am sad to see the death of super heavy class though  your foreground music is distracting and so detracting and irritating why cater to the addicted a most excellent description was damaged thanks for the info i believe i said wow about 8 times now was not that a pleasure reading this without your offensive music  i worked on this program this is a great overview of 787 great video  boeing does not build the wings for the 787 that is done in japan they are building the 777x wings now in everett they already blew it handing over the technology boeing is doomed i worked there for 25 years  watched on nebula but had to jump back to leave a comment this was one of the most interesting and educational episodes i have ever seen great job watch on nebula folks because your missing out  your the reason i am studying mechanical engineering now with hopes to work in the aerospace sector first watched your videos back in 10th grade cheers to the work you do for inspiring us  i would order my 787 private jet in raw exposed carbon fiber it would be rice out  axe the max  if u do not know about it i feel sorry for u  anyone play msfs 2020 after seeing this video  now if boeing could get other things like their software politics faa and labor practices right they would at least be meh   19 07  but can it do the cobra maneuver  a350 and a330neo still better  6 28 ohhhhhhhhhh snap why are the a350 windows so much smaller if it too has carbon fiber fuselage  i will fart as loud as i can and i hope it stinks just like poop so everyone can smell it lol windows are obsolete cameras projected on interior walls as if looking through windows would save much cost 787 cockpit windows crack frequently poor design of a part not needed  it was all good until the 737 and their failed rocket to the iss uhm  i have learned a lot   4 00 this is also how i make pi atas with a balloon and layers of paper mache  it is pronounced composite not composite i recently went to germany and flew on a 787 dreamliner and it is such a beautiful plane  me an engineering student before clicking this video there is nothing new or arevelatory i can learn from videos at this point me a hack noob about 5 minutes into this video oh damn fuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   you know us congress loves to waste money they approved the replacement of the 2 old 747 200 is the usaf uses for air force 1 with 2 new 747 8 is could have saved a lot of money with the 787 9 is and lowered operating costs at the same time there is literally no reason to be using an aircraft as large as the 747 to tote the potus around  i am in my first semester of college for aerospace engineering cool at i admit i am very ignorant when it comes to this stuff but would not the fuselage essentially being one big piece make repairs more difficult are they just counting on not having to make those types of repairs due to the strength of the material   00 58 this is made to benefit you he says showing a stack of qantas aircraft in what i assume is a perverse parody qantas who is motto should not be the spirit of australia but jam em in tight in my view while there are some part way decent seats in cattle class on an a380 qantas load management ensures that you are hard pressed to find any on smaller aircraft outside of business class at which time you will hear raucous laughter about the supposedly cheap seats to which you refer of course there is premium economy whose philosophy seems to be pay so much receive so little and qantas has such direct flights too as you mention with its leaner fleet qantas will fly you anywhere in europe you want to go paris sure qantas will fly you to london rome certainly there are many flights to london every week athens hey london is close enough that you could almost walk i am not arguing against the engineering benefits of the 787 but do not tell me for a minute that anyone who flies with qantas will benefit from them experience tells me otherwise the engineering content was interesting though  fun fact for the audience i used to work as a de icer in canada and you really noticed how heat did not travel as well on the 787 is fuselage because of composite material  with the whole plane being out of carbon fibre they could be easily switching to carbon fibre structual batteries for their electric planes your pronunciation of but is awesome politics of engineering video for a salesman rather than an engineer a good perception builder  excellent video  worked at toray composites for a while testing the prepreg we made for this plane and many others the tech is really cool but the process of making composite parts is really really expensive and time consuming not gonna be common in consumer goods until new processes are invented the fricken carbon copper mesh fabric was a bitch to machine and cut up my gloves constantly was also significan notly heavier and weaker i am glad they quit using it lol as someone who works maintaining aircraft and has worked a lot onthe 787 i have to admit that it is my favorite aircraft the 787 is going to keep me employed for many many years into the future i am looking forward to seeing the video on the 787 electrical system in my opinion the 787 tried to do too many new things at once the removal of bleed air and the fully intergrated electrical systems has been a complete nightmare for boeing and airlines the removal of bleed air has made the engines more efficient but they have had to radically change the way the whole electrical system is feed distributed and cooled as well as completely changes the aircondition system the pecs and ics system aircondition fans and compressors and high voltage dc systems seem to break down very frequently the amount of jobs that are regularly one on the 787 vs the 777 is pretty astronimical the carbonfibre construction actually comes with quite a few headaches too tradtitional aircraft could be repair after an impact or after a lightning strike pretty rapidly but that is not the case with the 787 it will likely improve in the future as more aircraft are damaged in service but there have been aircraft that have been grounded for months as no repair scheme was available the aircraft also seems to be more prone to lightning strikes whilst not rare on older aircraft the 787 seems more prone to lightning strikes and due to the more difficult repair schemes this can be a major headache to airlines and there engineering teams the a350 took a fair more conservative approach than the 787 did which is usually a good idea in the aviation industry airbus stuck to more traditional construction methods but added the use of carbon fibre they also stuck with a more tradition system layout due to keeping bleed air systems on the surface of it the a350 appears to have had fewer headaches since implementation  well scientists love using the term supercritical  informative thank you i usually have to take degas to avoid bloating when travelling long distances on an aeroplane  good and educational video i have a question what happens when it crashes i know we should not think negative but in case as we know plane is aluminum bend and deform but does not shatter which in some cases saves the ppl inside during a crash like a car is crumple zones absorbing energy what happens when there is not anything to deform reducing the impact as much carbon fibre is very brittle it shatters on impact into millions bits will it still have the property of absording impacts like aluminum during a crash for a higher survival rate if so how i know formula 1 have still a cage on the feet area during impact the carbon fibre is the absorbing factor and the cage stops it is there anything like a cage in this plane  thank you for all you do if you ever want to do the same type of show on privet jets please contact me thanks once again why does boeing get to benefit from publicly funded nasa but then turn around and ask for constant subsidies and bids from the government seems like the technology developed by the people should have its profits shared with the people  that is by far the best aircraft video i have even seen on youtube and i am a subscriber to avi es e m sicas that days a lot for a brazilian  wtf i am still in the stone age  i was a lead project engineer on the 787 ngs systems at the end of 2010 it took me 2 weeks to complete the test with boeing faa obar dar and we ran the test 16 hours a day including the weekend that was one of the two most hardest assignment i ever had in my career  damn that mcgregor joke always sad to see click bait titles including insane actually avoided this post for some time now and guess what disappointed nothing insane detected please stop just program good shit  boeing rarely had to gamble its budget on the success of its commercial airliners though the initial launch of the 747 came close since it could always fill in any shortfalls with its multi billion dollar military contracts the military amazingly has much higher tolerance for contractor screw ups than commercial business  no one ever flew 850 seat a380s disappoiniting start to a video after all that does not seem like much of a gamble to me  16 28 transitioning from laminar to turbulent flow the coefficient of drag actually decreases golf balls have dimples to create turbulence for less drag  if you think the engineering of a simple boeing 787 is complex try wrapping your head around an anvil carrack or origin 890 jump  this is an outstanding video thank you for the coverage and depth and analysis  i have to mention my relative liked your comment about the guy from alabama the accent in the early days of nasa in huntsville al priceless d do you have enough paper clips i had to drop engineering today they spend too much obsessing about someone they use to have some good content but the obsession has gotten worse when the disaster strikes it is gonna hurt them i just feel it  greatful everyday i do not have to know physics mind you the use of carbon fiber composites in airplanes was not original to the 787 there were multiple previous planes from boeing airbus embraer lockheed etc that already used them for various plane parts the 787 was just the next logical step in making most of the plane including the fuselage out of it  i love the nose of this plane reminds of me the de havilland comet  hehe lithium battery go brrrrrr just finished watching the full episode on nebula amazing work  simply one of the best channels on youtube  brilliant and riveting content made me a fan of this channel  what is annie shape  you want to impress me i want to see some sane engineering  so what are the plans for when the time comes to retire and scrap this composite airframe it is not like aluminum which is 100percent recyclable  can you do the insane engineering on the f 104 starfighter ok now i need to book a ticket this is so cool  this is awesome but it makes me wonder what boeing is sweeping under the rug i watch a lot of those shows where planes crash and it is always some story about how they knew about a defect but they had invested so heavily in it that admitting they were wrong would absolutely bankrupt the company so i just wonder how long it will be before one of these go down then the report will read that somebody somewhere was aware of something nobody seems to question new stuff because people are so amazed by new but new is messed up most of the time really does not it often seem like new and improved is always worse than what it replaced  mcgregor poirer 5 respect points any problems with microscopic imperfections or physical insults creating delamination and subsequent shearing forces that tear the craft into pieces what mitigations have been anticipated  sure are a lot of boeing haters in the comment section  pity the haters do not have any appreciation for the amazing engineering involved in this airplane must be really fun at parties btw the real secret to hlfc is not the manufacturing or the design of how it works it is how it keeps working after being exposed to bugs dirt dust de icer over the years that is the real secret sauce  thank you for making so many awesome videos such as this one  totally expect boeing to have used cheap engineering which might kill you while saving some dollars to the murderous boeing  i do not believe in boeing anymore although it is a great video  watch some other documentaries on this project and you will see what a disaster it is boeing claimed in 2013 the plane was complete and held a major press conference with even the president attending it was an outright lie boeing was not even close to a working prototype the production problems only continued when they hired the lowest bidders as contractors for every part of the plane realistically these contractors just could not make the working parts is it safe given what is happened with the 737 max recently only a true fool would trust boeing assuming it is safe the plane is still a disaster as even airbus has realized in the last ten years that space age planes really do not make business sense the costs involved in upgrading airport terminals to accept these planes far outweighs the rewards it is better to either upgrade existing planes or mid cost medium planes  somebody is a mma fan  i wont suport boeing until they pay for what they did with the max i will always book a flight with airbus operating it this company took hundreds of lives and have not paid for it in any meaningful way what is sad is how they have just got away with it and people and companies have just forgotten about this the families will never forget  i would like to subscribe to curiosity stream but i can not because they only accept ccredit card as payment method  only narrow body aircrafts use less fuel than this beast my favourite aircraft  one of the best real engineering vids yet really great content can not wait to fly on a 787  the airline industry is absolutely not changing for our benefit the planes themselves may be better but the overall experience is way worse i am old enough to remember flying in the 90s when they did not treat you like a terrorist in need of a groping and body cavity search every time you fly when they did not charge dollar70 for your checked bag when meals were standard and when people did not dress like they were at a slumber party love your content  please do not say fuselage that often hope this great american company makes a comeback could you do one of these videos on the space shuttle  real engineering makes video ranting imperial system and explains why metric system is superior also real engineering uses feet in the videos and provides no conversion to meters wow truly fascinating to learn that the reason why the engineers have not used aluminium in their fuselage composite was to prevent exactly what makes the batteries age galvanic corrosion  the 787 have also removed the internal sliding window shutters and instead use electronic dimming glass it is so cool to play around with  lighting strikes make this aircraft a melted mess i am surprised about aluminium is galvanic corrosion to appear on carbon fiber  i know aluminium can corrode with copper and liquids or even different grades of aluminium can also corrode with liqiuds due to this effect but i did not expect this to occour with epoxy in the exact same way   hey scienced the shit out of that plane i dare say it redefines what a commercial airliner even is  holy shit the whole ass cabin section of the plane is carbon fiber here i thought he was going to say like a bunch of parts were carbon fiber or something not the whole damn thing amazing technology but a pity the airlines ruined it by squishing the narrowest seats in airline history in order to get that extra column of seats in the economy section have done numerous long flights on this but is terrible for more than about 5 or 6 hours night flights are pure misery  i am currently pursuing aerospace engineering all the facts are depicted so accurately and the explanation is so so easy compared to how our professors explain this single video legit consisted of 3 of my aerospace engineering semester kindly upload more such great videos i learned a lot from your channel due to the visualization techniques than i learn in college  aaaaaand the fart jokes are the reason i buy your gear boeing cutting costs that always seems suspicious they are the same people who cut costs in max8  and a 30b dolars investment with such a big landslide costs with no forseable returns of the costs good bet are u joking  a350 hasn t windows as small as represented and it isn t even made of aluminium as told boeing boy fan with no real analysis no profund knowledge whatsoever bad video   realengineering how can i get nebula if i am already subscribed to the curiositystream  amazing humans  you gave a great presentation no wars instead spend dollardollardollardollardollar and human ingenuity on further r amp d of human civilizations  9 2021  now i see why it is a more innovative aircraft than the a380 with a strong focus on reduced fuel consumption great production packed with information hopefully a lightening strike will never blow off a composite tail fin or other important item  really nice video however like the previous aircraft video i am left with a bit of regret that there is no comparaison with equivalent concurent aircraft but i understand the hours of research it take for just one system must be enormous  way to many adds you really need a second brain that was very interesting i had no idea the 787 was that revolutionary  had the pleasure to fly in the 787 best flight ever two engine passenger aircraft crossing the atlantic with hundreds of people on board it is honestly mad how far we have come  cracks in mcgregors leg  less airplane farts  sign me up lol  thanks for all you do for these videos so enjoyable and informative  oh man wendover is gonna be so pissed at you  the 787 is my all time favorite i am just wondering if that flexible wing reduces the effect of turbulence on the cabin but i really notice the drop in cabin altitude i have read also that a composite plane can actually run a more humid interior as there is no corrosion issues is this true i really noticed how much better i felt on arrival than in other types  i got to fly on a 787 back in july the degree to which the wings flex up in flight is really noticeable over more conventional planes  i love the references to porier vs mcgregor 2 d as a mechanical engineer every time i watch your videos i am left with goosebumps  i think tony stark joined boeing after the endgame  what a fascinatingly detailed video thank you  petition to change the channel name real engineering to insane engineering  i worked in an aircraft manufacturing plant in wichita called spirit aerosystems they do alot of stuff for boeing most notably the 737 fuselage they also manufacture the front part of the 787 i have seen the machines that lay the tape and its incredible one of the worlds largest autoclave is in spirit and used to cook the cockpit after its done a plane called the dream lifter picks up the cockpit sections 2 at a time the whole front part of the plane swings open to fit them inside the screamliner is a bastard to work on not boeing is finest hour oh man hearing you talk about materials engineering is the best thing on youtube thanks for a great video the sr 71 does this same trick as well to reduce the delay turbulent flow god i love watching these videos  fuck composite materials and fiber carbons metals can be much stronger and usefule like titanium and steel alloys with scandium and what not long live metals  i want flush fit rivets  the 787 is the most comfortable passenger jet i have ever flown on it is so quiet   1 31 could you imagine trying to heat and cool or even clean a building so massive jesus christ great video on a magnificent aircraft it still tho has to be seen for future aircraft designs that they will follow the 787 design style bleed less and more cfrp aircraft have yet to really follow a350 is not as cfrp also another interesting part would then be the recycling of these type of aircraft when they come to the end of their lives this could be a one off aircraft design  love the mcgreggor references  i did not see those mcgregor references coming  you are awesome  excuse the randomness but here you go have some warm recommendations cause the learning never ends thats the entire reason yes it is ok to be smart professor dave explains krimson rogue cynical reviews michio kaku veritasium  this video in my opinion is one the most interesting and passionate i have ever seen so inspiring and rich as a pilot student with a career under development and a complete lover of aerodynamics and mechanics i am thrilled congrats for this amazing quality content  best shape for a craft is that it has wings at the back like concord had wings in the midle causes extream drag and even instabilities mid flight no wonder turbulence these engineers are 100 years behind its own knowledge design like this is from 60 is totaly absolete layman here what is the expected life spanof these composite parts i once learned that composite materials do not show signs of aging but rather break without prior notice i think that behavior will make maintenance tricky with a 25 year old aircraft frame  amazing video do you have more information on how two separate sections of the carbon fiber fuselage are bonded together after curing in the autoclave  great video clear and very well documented thank you for the references    who is macgrerrer airplanes are for loser i use my legs individual parts and how it comes together as a whole is amazing  why do not we use it on submarines or do we already   norsk is norwegian in norwegian feels very weird when you refer to norsk titanium by only saying norwegian  never really know that 787 were super engineered with those feature that 60 minute nebula was worth it another amazing video thanks i can not wait for more not an engineer but grew up flying in a composite experimental so it is really cool to see this used on a commercial level seriously love your videos it is fun to learn these concepts nice to see something positive about boeing  looks like they did something right here  i always wonder what will happen when fossil fuels get exhausted and how these jumbo jets will fly thereafter electric  as a student of aircraft maintenance watching your videos makes me love my course and technology and engineering in general even more thank you for pumping out these high quality indepth videos for dollar0  this was a very informative and enjoyable video fun fact many of the concepts discussed in this video are also considered in the design of tall building structures  you should also mention the issues the aircraft has had the batteries and customers refusing delivery due to debris and missing fasteners  why the 787 has no fins at the end of the wings that thing that reduces the vortex at the very tip of the wing  aka the kmart boeing excellent video  i went to the air canada maintenance facility a few years ago and got to take a closer look at this beauty you really do not get the scale of these things until you are standing under its wing you look up and look down it expecting it to end but it just keeps going nice cockpit too enjoyed the video thanks just a point on the fuselage of the 787 yes the barrels are wound by the robots with prepreg but the stiffening ribs are still hand layed up also you showed the a350 window size and said it was made of alloy but it too is made from carbon fiber just a different method cheers those guilty humans that abused me all my life prevented me from dating girls and took my son away from me and abused my son all his life those guilty humans can take longer trips on their holidays and business trips that their companies that support them pay for to add some color on the subject these headlines were in the news today 5th oct 2021 seems airbus may or may not depending on who is right here be having some problems with the surface of its own composite bodied plane i note that qatar airways was the first airline to buy them easa says it found no airworthiness issue with a350 easa no concerns w composite structure lightning protections qatar airways says a350 lightning protection also affected airbus says it is identified cause of a350 paint issue qatar air will not buy more a350s until surface issue resolved qatar air more a350s may be grounded by local regulator qatar airways says a350 paint problem led to composite cracks qatar airways ceo akbar al baker speaks in interview this is the best engineering channel on youtube so high quality videos and so entertaining its so insane they decided to add an mcas in it  6 28 nice random mma reference  i loved the a380  my most favorite airplane  i have enjoyed these videos but i query this one as you curiously ignore the airbus a350 the other big innovation in aviation using carbon fibre reinforced polymer the dreamliner did not inspire the a350 boeing simply got the 787 out first and not by much either so i am curious not just for the total focus on the 787 but the narrative you push that this plane alone revolutionises civil aviation it did but alongside the a350 i have to wonder if one of boeing is pr firms have funded this a naughty question perhaps but i do wonder  the channel that makes engineers feel cool fantastic thank you  once again the quality of your videos blows me away beyond just the brilliant tech of the machine in question clear easy to follow and with great graphics and footage  i love how he made that laugh sigh when he said fart as much lol  15 58 destin from smarter every day have been summoned  what did they say about your stomach bloating such bs  the dreamliner series are still plagued with lots of serious structural and engineering problems lots of recalls   less rivets cause less drag oh stop lol this is even more insane  this is a great resource for anyone training to become a pilot or an engineer we were delighted to be able to contribute the wing box model thanks for such an informative video  hello humans at any given moment there are 1 800 thunderstorms happening on earth this amounts to 16 million storms each year terrance out very very interesting but i hope that in near future you will publish a similar video for a350 with highlighted differences and pros and cons  during a class my teacher would pass around a 1x1 foot piece of 787 skin and a ball peen hammer and he told us to hit the skin as hard as we could and yes we could use the ball side that piece survived all of us hitting it and several classes before us aluminum skin would have been dented badly by just a few hits  amazing video my daughter has worked on the 787 for many years you explain the building of the airplane very well thank you your videos help immensely when it comes to applying concepts and calculations taught in class to real world applications my aerodynamics class has never made this much sense before after watching this video haha thank you for everything you do  lol mcgregor cracks  if you confess jesus as lord and believe he was raised from the dead you will be saved romans 10 9  the entire nature of air travel has changed to benefit you and your needs  you sound like a tool for the air travel industry yes it is more convenient but they do this to increase their bottom line more than anything  what is the use of this increased efficiency when it is leading to increased airline travel  the narration is terrible and makes this video unwatchable i guess that is why mike roe makes the big bucks  yet the next product from boeing was the max we know how that worked for them and now they are working on the 777x without a composite fuselage sounds like the board does not want the engineers to build ground breaking planes any longer  watching this video in my dorm while majoring in aerospace engineering is so cool having flown on both the 787 and the a350 i can say that in matters of comfort room and air quality the 787 takes the cake by far especially with the first two coming from an economy passenger btw  great video correct about the heated blankets replacing the bleed air system but it will still get sprayed with type i and type iv just like everyone else  on the nose rivets can contribute to a lot of parasitic drag but further back they are in the boundary layer and barely make a difference you will notice that on russian fighters they only bother with flush rivets on the front of the airplane  737max finally on trending wow your 3d animation is really getting good can not wait for the engine video killing almost 1000 people is the way of the future boeing aircraft are all a crash waiting to happen  a good illustrative video at about the comparison of composites with aluminium alloys using that stress strain curve is quite inaccurate as mentioned in the footnotes composites are brittle to the point they do not have any plastic deformation at all and the curve is almost a straight line until fracture could have shown two different stress strain curves instead of trying to convey the comparison with just one  another downside of the 787 is that you can not look out the giant window if the pilot or air hosts do not want they electrochromatically dim the bloody windows   26 51 boeing argued that money is more important than peasant lives is what should have been said tbh regarding the hlfc doors from sakurai seiya and matthew d fevergeon door assembly for laminar flow control system u s patent no 8 245 976 21 aug 2012 the door assembly may be fluidly connected to the laminar flow control system of the aircraft by a diffuser or other ducting such that when the first door is moved to the open position the pores of the laminar flow control system may be purged by high pressure external flow captured by the first door and which may be ducted to the suction cavity for discharge through the pores the discharge of flow through the pores may effectively remove contaminants such as liquid and or debris that may be trapped in the pores when the first door is moved to the closed position and the second door is moved to the open position a suction force may be generated in the suction cavity in this regard the opening of the second door may generate an external region aft of the second door that has an external pressure that is less than a cavity pressure within the suction cavity the external pressure may result in the generation of the suction force within the suction cavity which may draw the external flow located proximate the porous skin through the pores and into the suction cavity more specifically the application of the suction force to the porous skin draws a portion of the boundary layer through the pores as is know in the art the drawing in or suctioning of the boundary layer may delay transition of the boundary layer to turbulent flow and may decrease skin friction drag the visible doors are both the outlet of the plumbing system opening one way with the scoop facing aft to discharge the air that enters through the pores and presumably on approach the method for clearing out the pores that have been clogged by dirt or debris by pressurizing the cavity underneath the skin with ram air ingested through the scoop  but the 787 is not a unique competitor and the airbus a350 xwb is equal if not better this episode is a true kind of propaganda the make america great again is still alive a proof 5 51 a350 is not an aluminium body truth is exact opposite from wikipedia the a350 is the first airbus aircraft largely made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer  if it is boeing i am not going they have killed too many innocent people i had no idea it was because of the carbon fibre body that they could increase the cabin pressure having flown from sydney to la in one of these i can tell you it makes a huge difference to jet lag  bmx restoration 0 5dollar   16 42 gordon murray is god brabham formula 1 fans no pun intended  when fueling the 787 with all 3 tanks accepting fuel it will regularly draw 600 gallons of fuel per minute however at the end of the refuel it will slow down to 200 gallons per minute or less as you have only got 1 or 2 valves open this means that the last 1000 lbs of fuel take way longer than anyone ever wants to deal with  wow  great video seems to me airliners should just dispense with windows altogether they could just replace them with cameras we need to talk about your definition of massive  during materials strength testing they kept having random parts fail far below their designed strength under a microscope everything looked perfectly fine they decided to send some failed parts for chemical analysis and discovered trace amounts of peanut oil the source ended up being a worker who upon eating their daily peanut butter sandwich for lunch returned to work without washing their hands  whats with the stupid conor mccregor reference dislike  dump boeing buy airbus thank you for making this excellent video i will go check out the full version on nebula i think the 787 is the most beautiful passenger airliner since the concorde my favorite has always been the gorgeous 727 with its long graceful wings completely unencumbered by engines but the 787 is wings are truly things of beauty it looks much like a bird in flight and it is an amazing aircraft maybe i will get to actually take a flight in one someday   as soon as he said the 850 passenger a380 and the 660 passenger 747 i was done if you are going to make a documentary make an accurate one engineers have no time for people who are off by more than 25percent  i am going to be impressed by the aerospace industry only and just only when they finally spare passengers from thrombosis by separating coach seats

fire and brimstone which is the second death god sent his son jesus to earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice to take on all the sins of the world both past present and future sins shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins after dying on the cross he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to heaven to show life after death to show everlasting life through jesus is sacrifice john 14 6 states jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me romans 10 13 states for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved   eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away all you have to do is believe that jesus christ the son of god died on the cross for your sins as an atonement for your sins and rose from the grave on the 3rd day ask jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in heaven salvation is a free and everlasting gift from god please do not let pride drag you into eternal punishment in hell but ask jesus to give you eternal life in heaven if you are getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this it is because satan does not want you to get saved he wants you to resist and think it is not real he wants you in hell for all eternity with him hell is not a fun place like worldly people like to imagine it is everlasting torture with no relief i am only taking the time to text this because i want to get the message out there are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people keeping people from thinking about salvation keeping you from thinking about life after death please ask jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness ask him for a place in heaven and he will save you from eternal damnation in hell  i flew on an ana 787 to japan best flying experience of my life  i only fly in planes with at least 4 engines does it have mcas system  sorry but the 787 has not paid off after 1000 deliveries the program is still down some dollar18 billion and we are coming up on the 1 year anniversary of deliveries being halted it is expected that boeing will take a charge on the program in the upcoming quarter and the 100 aircraft that they have built up in inventory unable to deliver are costing them an additional dollar500 million a year  music to my ears the planes are good the software sucks  i do not get it are you saying we will not have city sized planes one day i am not satisfied until we at least have skyscraper sized objects zooming over our homes the angular velocity is a lowercase omega not a double u  does god exist the short answer is yes and the long answer is that we can use things that we can see to know that there is a god for example behold the sun it goes up and comes down every 12 hours now is it reasonable to believe this is and accident why is not it 4 or 5 or 500 hours or never  why do you pronounce it heigth instead of height good content though also it is po ree yay  fantastic video damn this is so interesting  do the insane engineering of the past of the fore fathers of this plane too please it is cool too see the progress of things we take for granted now how much did boeing pay you for this  feet eww anyways my city is at about 1km elevation i wonder if that reduces discomfort when i fly i have never noticed it personally  that was not a picture of mt olympus that was mt rainier some 6000 feet taller at 14 400 ft high mt olympus i believe is in the olympic rainforest on the washington state penninsula  very good sir loved the 2nd vid on nebula too wow the 787 sounds amazing i wanna fly on one now  please do not forget to put the equivalent of feets in meters  leaving a comment for the algorithm since this is a very interesting video i low key freaked out when i saw the thumbnail this is my favorite commercial aircraft those wings are just so  amazing video breathtaking video so interesting and awesome animations real engineering blink twice if wendover productions is holding you at gunpoint  keearbon fiber lol was not expecting mma to be brought into this at all guess next video will be the insane engineering of conor mcgregor is new unbreakable titanium shinbone xd hahaha mcgregor is broken leg and dustins knee made me laugh so hard duno why  hey real engineering can you state that you have a better version of the video on nebula before you talk about planes for 30 min so i can go watch there instead of here sadly there are too many indications that the dreamliner is the last of the engineering masterpieces boeing used to design now that they prefer recycling old designs and cut corners new breakthroughs like this are becoming less likely plus the corporate culture is moving away from the boldness required to make huge steps forward like the 787 did for the whole industry boeing is stepping down from being a leader to becoming a follower and this can even be felt in the 787 is production line obviously the plane is too costly but rightly so but now with boeing promoting at all costs their plan in the us south even though they do not have the competence of the historic factory and cutting corners in the manufacturing and quality control even the reputation of the 787 is being tarnished it had some troubles yes but they were coming from outsourced parts now the troubles emanate from boeing themselves i hope i am wrong but i would not be surprised if we soon heard of a crash of a 787 due to manufacturing problems by boeing  imo one of the most agreeable developments in the media has been that producers are less afraid of overwhelming the audience with highly technical information thanks for the great video i can not imagine how much work it must have been to make it  titanium is not just costly to buy it is costly to work with it oxidizes at a drop of a hat which is great for corrosion resistance but makes welding difficult it is also really really difficult to machine   less farting is always nice   ufc references lol while it is true the 787 absolutely shamed airbus by 4 years it is also true boeing management not only allowed but blessed the 737 max debacle that almost any engineering student right out of college would have known was wrong you can glamorize boeing is greatest achievements but the company as a whole has made an epic number of embarrassing mistakes and fails even early 787 is had issues with onboard fires that could haven been fatal to passengers the boeing that designed the 747 was a world class company today is boeing mostly just cares about their short term stock price above all else including passenger safety  the mcgregor burn  doctor stoppage    28 29 for a typical wing installation where you are circulating the air where does the nitrogen fit in so that the wings are properly protected from the lightning liars you are circulating the exhaust fo the engine throughout the volume of the wing  next the insane engineering of the 737 max  26 43 i suspect there will be a crash caused by thos cost saving measure sooner or later this will hit boeing hard  if i may ask can i use this video as a source for my assay if i can thank you so much mate yes carbon reinforced plastic sure sounds safe in the event you had to make an emergency landing also they will never rot and litter the landscape worse than before idiots further more they did not use the composite carbon reinforced plastics on the leading edges of the wings because of bird collisions which can damage the wings so they are that safe huh just because you spent a lot of money and time and effort and resources does not mean you were efficient with doing so and it certainly does not mean you achieved a result worth remembering  surprised you showed the videos of the static safety test without mentioning the issues this test posed for boeing on the 787 although granted you covered a lot in this video is that on the nebula version  john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life  just wow the level detailed explanation of each part is just mind blowing do not have word to praise your work thank you brother for this video  more power to you unfourtnatly we do not have access to nebula in india  25 43 those damn left wing fuel tanks always being concerned with the welfare of all and exploding  can you make a video about the iar 111  almost the tesla of the sky  umm ok yes in theory the bonding of the fuselage creates one big part rather than a whole bunch of little parts put together and that is a good thing when it works meanwhile boeing has over 100 of these planes completed but undeliverable yet that is because they may have made mistakes when making that one big part and now they have to strip them down completely at a cost of millions per plane to check if they need fixing and boeing does not want to do that so they are negotiating the creation of a statistical analysis process to predict  which areas of which planes need fixing that is actually quite interesting but it is not a great advertisement for composites to put it mildly  fantastic engineering by american technology world leader good reason why others want to steal this technology still boeing will be ahead of others  the engineering benefits from composites are obviously huge but a major drawback i think is that they can not be recycled i know aluminium is alsoe very hard to reuse but with carbon fibre it is virtually impossible every plane and car bike shoe made with carbon fibre is bound to end up as hazardous waste circular economy is vital to avoid covering the entire planet in waste carbon fibre is a dead end in this regard do you know any method to reuse or recycle these planes  love the mma easter eggs in this one had the pleasure of being onboard the dreamliner on a transatlantic flight that was just perfect the way this combines most of my engineering knowledge is terrific  love the mma references  who would win in a fight mcgregor or the 787   20 16 wait a minute correct me i am wrong but was not this what boeing nailed bombardier for selling aircraft bellow their actual price claiming it is predatory business practice and getting the american president to put a 300percent teriff tax on bombardier aircraft it sounds hypocritical of boeing to do  but brian i still fart a lot in planes  in the 787 we see the boeing we really know and love the one that makes the changes create new features and team up with nasa to do amazing stuff and speaking of nasa and boeing did lamborghini also work with them when the sesto elemento was a thing  amazing well done video anxious for the next video impossible not to love the 787  if only the management of boeing did not mess things up so incredibly much for almost all their modern projects  my biggest problem with this design is how much reliability is this composite materiel gonna have in sub zero temperatures i have seen what happens to carbon fibre panels in minus 40 c temperatures of the cold canadian north it can become brittle and crack over time  if there is ever a 787 accident caused by cockpit window frame degradation or fuel tank ignition due to improper insulation let the world watch this video and notice how boeing put its bottom line ahead of safety once again   most advanced commercial aircraft out there has ashtrays built into the toilet right next to the no smoking sign the engineering of the first 747 with little of the tech of today and that started over 60 years ago and it is right up there with first moon walk xceot the goverment was not paying for it it is a meeting with someone with the education of the narrator here does not have the building to pronounce aluminum probably one small correction at 5 47 the a350 like the 787 has a composite fuselage so it is not an aluminium airframe oh another one at 6 47 you say that the fuselage is one massive part over a clip showing the fuselage in at least three sections  sorry no the fuselage is not one massive part there are section joins that get made in the final assembly location the nose including cockpit comes in as one piece the aft pressure bulkhead and tail section without surfaces as another and i seem to recall a mid body join as well  less farting is always nice real engineering 2021 fantastic video mate thanks a lot   5 13   beautiful until a wing snaps off lightning brings it down batteries light on fire or another issue with software this company is the worst sold all my stock  you know what the carbon fibre reinforced plastics remind me of duroplast that was essentially the same idea and it was absolutely not recyclable and most resins are toxic when burnt  how big of battery would airplane of this size need to fly  wonder if they have plans to put the copper and fixing insulations back since the 737 max who needs redundant systems anyway catastrophes  lol conor is leg     16 16 figuring out how to or if it is even possible to predict turbulent flow is one of the clay institute millennium problems  hey just watched the nebula version and the audio is just so much better that it is impressive love the dreamliner but be real the plane has so much quality problems that operators like norweigan had to dump the plane    boeing employs insane engineers  mcgregor disliked this vid you know what i will remembered most about this video 7 ads plus the plugs for nebula i get it you need to get paid for your work but if the ads are distracting from said work i do not think you are doing such a good work or at the very least you are doing a good advertising job hope you get some money out of this spam edit do not get me wrong the video is astonishingly well put together but i struggle to remember most of it because of the ads i am just sad that because i am on youtube and not paying for yet another service i got treated as well badly as old regular tv  fart 10 of the world is funniest one liners 1 campers nature is way of feeding mosquitoes 2 always remember that you are unique just like everyone else 3 consciousness that annoying time between naps 4 few women admit their age few men act it 5 if we are not supposed to eat animals why are they made with meat 6 no one is listening until

because you have sinned against god let is see if that is true have you ever lied even once ever stolen anything jesus said whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already with her in his heart ever looked with lust if you have said yes to these three questions by your own admission you are a lying thieving adulterer at heart and we have only looked at three of the ten commandments how will you do on judgment day will you be innocent or guilty you know that you will be guilty and end up in hell that is not god is will he provided a way for you to be forgiven he sent his son to take your punishment god commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death god promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins and trust in jesus christ please do that today  you may not have tomorrow see john 14 21 for a wonderful promise then read the bible daily and obey what you read god will never let you down visit needgod com    afaik airbus have been using supercritical wings for many years   kind of like cracks in mcgregor is leg shortened his career lol i love your little quips here and there but the mcgregor one made me actually laugh out loud  i was a 787 captain for five years some very interesting information here however a few things about the de ice anti ice that are not totally correct while it is true that the leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces are electrically heated the bleed system has not been totally eliminated the front edge of the engine nacelles still use bleed air to heat and prevent or remove ice also just because the wing and tail system does not require engine bleed air this does not mean we can run it on the ground and not have to do traditional fluid based deicing the heated surface is just the leading edge which is where ice typically begins forming in flight static on the ground however the airframe is susceptible to other types of freezing precipitation like snow rain sleet and frost which can adhere to all parts of the wing  in other words minimizing the use of bleed air is an effective fuel savings measure but it is still used as is fluid deicing on the ground  i applaud all of the pilots that are excited for longer flights  check what maximus aviation has posted about the 787  fake planes are fake elon musk is a turtle  there are more than 100 videos on my channel i can not understand how someone gets a million views and someone will not get a hundred thousand in 2 years  it would have been apriciated if you told us at the beginning about the extra material on nebula so i would watch the video from there i never use nebula when it is not strictly necessary because it is absolute shit terrible app and horrible audio quality   why would you build a fuselage from carbonfibre composites 7 3percent less farting what  what  i would like to add inert gas system is used by nearly all the planes easa and faa wants 80percent afair of the fleet to have ngs nitrogen generating system for the fuel tanks and probably it will be mandatory for all the planes have this system soon boeing does not add this new technology to here it is one of the ways to prevent fire in the fuel tank since 2000 is  such an awesome plane i flew nonstop from honolulu to newark new jersey on one of these bad boys nearly 5 000 miles  as a metallurgy student i am able to understand this video very quickly  can we all agree that when he uploads our day gets better  can we all agree that when he uploads our day gets better  is carbon fibre fireproof fibreglass is highly inflammable carbon fiber comes from petroleum and consumes a lot of energy while green carbon fiber can be made with solar furnaces i hope petrol airplanes get grounded as soon as possible as big polluters having sailboats to travel large distances there can be made airplanes with green materials and propulsion but they still are inefficient compared to the rest of transportation  i had the chance to travel in a 787 once it looks so cool and beautiful i am surprised to hear that carbon fibre can be elastic years of watching f1 has gotten me used to the idea that when carbon fibre fails it shatters like glass  great vid mate nebula sucks ass the search and recommendation algorithm are a deal breaker had it for maybe 3 days before canceling it was infuriating  6 19   did i just watch a boeing add  innovation here and there which already exists before wtf the dreamliners are the most sexiest planes ever no cap this technology needs to be shared with other countries for a cleaner earth the insane advertising of boeing in this channel a love letter to my favorite jet airliner  how is the a380 iconic how many decades has it been in public service 747 is the most iconic imo  honestly as amazing as the 787 is this video has cemented my opinion that boing is complicit in murder and needs to be disbanded the 737 max was an inexcusable clusterfuck of chasing profits and ignoring warnings the mcas issue was bad enough the fact that re certification had to be withheld for over a year due to a slew of other previously undiscovered issues should frankly have ended that designs service life and end the careers of anyone in upper management involved on the 787 there are many statements from designers working on the project that management repeatedly ignored warnings and pushed for the project to move on in the design stages additionally there are reports that to avoid delays on the launch of the aircraft the first 10 100 airframes were constructed in a rush co opting every employee that was available and without proper logs of which parts went into which aircraft or proper testing of components received from subcontractors add to this issues with battery fires i believe it is understandable that i do not trust boeing when they say that these expensive features were not needed  how do they detect fuselage material fatigue in a dreamliner would hate to imagine it failing catastrophically midair  turbulent this video should have been done for the a350 the 787 is terrible in maintenance what ever hits the fuselage that is it the plane is done no fixing even boeing is reviewing if they will ever build any fuselage out of carbon again the bottom line is airbus a350 is selling better every year after its creation  i am in aerospace engineering and you have just summarised a 4 year degree in 30 minutes educational system seriously needs an upgrade   your nearby airports has more flights then ever before luxembourgers x to doubt how hard is it to repair carbon fiber composite material  reading about removing the lightning protection kinda scares me apparently the faa is certification office initially rejected the change because boeing had not adequately demonstrated it was safe but amanagement approved it upon appeal that sounds like a backroom deal if i have ever heard one i am not saying it is unsafe but i am not as confident as i would like to be  first plane i have been in an amazing and unforgettable experience  why could not they just make some holes on the leading edges to allow air to flow from front to back causing similar laminar suction on the upper wing surface no need to pumps or ducting since airflow comes in the front and leaves the back of the wing causing a suction inside the wing   it has killed it is passengers twice so far the 787 is great for overnight flights as it is easy to sleep on one that is probably do to the increased pressure and easily changeable humidity  nice vid o but it is certification and first year were not the smoothest  turbulent flow looks like the perfect job for machine learning  do not care for bigger windows because they tell you to close them anyways might as well get rid of the windows altogether since the can not be used for emergency escape they substitute with external cameras which would give you better views in all directions and reduce weight  lol like the mma references very smooth  incredibly made video  have things really changed in passenger air travel no  if it is boeing i aint going  can you also make a video about the a350  a bit disappointed not to mention the issues on the entire supply chain caused by this design as part of the first outsourced program by boeing i consider this fully part of the engineering of the 787 but maybe in a future video  the first full plane i flew on was a 787 to chicago from sf first ever plane i flew on was a crj200  lovely looking plane however i would not trust boeing as far as as i could throw em when you exchange engineers for bean counters safety suffers  i would not trust boeing to even take out my trash why are you praising only american tech  ever considered a tutorial on those amazing plane renders  i thought the equal transit theory was falsified  autoclave not oven just watched the entire 1 hour version on nebula totally worth it but i would like to suggest a new name crash course how to build an 787  mr mcmanus i could be wrong here but are not you mixing up turbulent flow and a detached airflow at around 16 30 if i am not mistaken a turbulent boundary layer continues to adhere to the object is surface while the video depicts a partially stalled wing resulting from detached airflow thanks for your time  and they say math is racist what is gonna happen when they lower the standards in school  would it be possible that the 2 doors at 18 17 are for regulating airflow inside those nano intake channels in case they generate turbulences  great video man i am an aircraft engineer who works on the 787 you nailed a lot of the key differences on the 87  honestly it has a lot of design flaws but that is largely due to boeing is corporate greed having a supply chain spanning the entire world does not help and the titanium slivers in the plane close to the crucial wires makes this plane a time bomb 1percent of the switches that control the emergency fire extinguishers do not work and the bad manufacturing process followed by the south carolina factory adds even more problems helps to have the faa in the pocket  i thought we have decided that the bernoulli principle is not the cause of lift anymore anyone  this was a masterpiece very well done  i would love to be member of nebula but i am not american and do not have a credit card do they accept european debet card payments as well  second time i am falling for this shitty curiositystream nebula thing first time i paid full price and did not get nebula access this time the exact same shit they should fix their crap first before big advertising is made definitely was the last time i tried that now  i wonder if fans behind the wingtips would mitigate the drag otherwise generated allowing for lower aspect ratios while keeping efficiencies reasonable fans directly behind wings in general is an interesting concept  what a phenomenal video awesome  amazing video really great work  very interesting i was involved in the electric start of the trent1000 hamilton sundstrand and the rotating diode problem look foreward to part 2 what is the fire rating of the carbon fibre  bah science i am just here for the irish accent s every time you drop a video my mind is blown truly ove your content 787 is a pos loud uncomfortable the smart windows make it impossible to take nice pictures without a blue tinge and the gps does not work inside it  thanks so much for the long awaited information on this insane 787  this video made me respect the 787 100percent more than i did before oh yeah and the mickey mouse 737 max  such a good video the carbon fiber shins got me   dis fella has lost da plot he reckons dat everyone is flyin in de air whereas everybody is actually stuck at home  a350 an aluminium airliner  loved the ufc references  amazing video may i suggest the a350 please are you held hostage by wendower productions  would be interesting to find out what fire risk the faa has given this aircraft cause i think the resin used with the carbon fibre is highly flammable  great work here clearly illustrated and explained former lockheed div mechanical design engineer the additional titanium probably has to do with a skeletal strengthening of the overall fuselage structure amp perhaps the wing join  good stuff i fly around 30 times a year never flying another boeing plane again after the 737 max fiasco and the fact nobody was put in jail  well i want to see it on youtube video so i can not wait anymore to see the great engineering work on the b787 engine because it is one of the most challenging part for engineers and to build a brand new plane you definitely need a cutting edge new technology to integrate with it for competition and increase the sale for the beneficient for the company revenue  i play airline manager and my go to play is always the b787 although it is just a game when i calculated the cost range and capacity it really gives you no other options if i have more money i buy a380 but i my fleet is 2 3 b787 9 mass air travel has been a disaster for the west  so it is not until the end of the video that things do not look as pretty and it is back to boeing being boeing aka cutting on safety features to reduce costs  the level of wow from a youtube video between all of the information gathering editing voice over and then on top of that sourcing all of the footage for this video is insane as a fellow videographer very well made props to you and your team you earned a sub and for it to be free to watch  guys this is just insane the level of effort put into something like this so make sure to comment to help boost the algorithm let this be the new standard for videos  this video is a gem  30 00 is that the voice of low spec gamer  having watched a bunch of videos on the starliner and the 737 max boeing having competent engineers is honestly surprising to me  amazing video thank you and looking forward to the next part excellent video incredible  so much qantas at the beginning  imagine the thousands of engineers scientists physicists etc that go into producing one of these people who have dedicated their lives to their engineering materials science etc so that it can all come together for the benefit of humanity but then some guy watches a wacky video from some random uneducated dude who says carbon fiber is not actually safe or strong and that titanium causes cancer so said guy goes onto social media saying i did my research and these planes are not safe do not fly in them  unfortunately todays boeing is money gt safety so we still need to wait to see was this one exception or not  amazing 60 minute version loved it on nebula the only thing i could not overlook is that you wrote kn whilst it should be kn still amazing though  i love watching your videos i probably shouldnt waste this much time but this was interesting  fantastic video thanks 787 max anyone  the video is excellent on the engineering but inaccurate on the rest 1 there is not a radical market change the boeing 767 is around since 1980 and is a smaller long range aircraft than the 787 any change the 787 is said to have brought around was possible since the 90s if anything the 787 is actually worse for point to point service because it is a lot heavier and a bit bigger than the 767 it replaces not the 777 the 777 is a lot larger than the 787 and is replaced by the 777x and the a350 the 787 sells because it is a good aircraft not because it revolutionized the market or is an aircraft with specs not seen before 2 the a350 is not a competitor to the 787 since it is a lot larger the 787 competitor is the a330neo which despite being an aluminium plane sells almost as well as the 787 if you look at yearly sales these days 3 anti ice systems are standard on modern airliners it is not a new 787 feature 4 the 787 was not the first to eliminate bleed air the dc 8 did that too decades ago  okay but do any of the commercial airliners have missile flares amazing but i do not like how brittle carbon fiber is how well can this plane fly when damaged compared to it contemporary counterparts  literally just flew in one and was admired by the engines on the wings they are huuuge in person this type of engineering makes rocket science look like a b ch     cairben foibur as the italians say only love is stronger than carbon fibre  if we are talking technology wise then sure but the 787 is not directly rivaled with the a350 but rather the a330 similar size and utility  sorry to say but the a350 kinda outsmarted the 787 as part of this new gen breed of engineering the 787 entered service as a problematic aircraft and still stays this way till now which the a350 does not suffer from  this video quite literally summed up my last 4 years studying as an aerospace engineer  this engineering was simply insane  well researched well narrated well edited and pedagogic a solid red thread through the video but also relevant deep dives in the theory and history of the features utilized not too deep to lose momentum in the overall story but detailed enough to give context and explanation i love the reference inclusion at precisely the right moments those moments you are likely if you are just bit critical to what you watch and you always should be to think wait what that is a bold claim  thanks well done and the beauty right now i have 786 comments on the counter when pressing comment button  i wonder if the next part will include the autopilot failures of boeing  it feels like you have just told me that boeing has invented heisenberg compensators  if it was not because of your videos a lot of people would not have known how much engineering goes into making such a complex machine so boeing and other companies knows how to save fuel and there fore could share knowledge to reduce pollution but they keep it in secret karma is real no wonder why boeing suffered from big fails when their planes crashed  will you do the same for a350  the main thing i do not like about the 787 is the window tint system and the way the cabin crew can override and lock out the seat controls it would be nice if boeing shifted production back to seattle that way there would be fewer problems being found with completed aircraft coming from sc you would think that after 10 years the north charleston plant would have ironed out the final assembly problems not get worse  there is no mt olympus in washington state lived here my whole life maybe your thinking of the olympic mountains and no one really goes up there so know one even knows much about them can not imagine i am getting smarter all because i learned english through video game 11 years ago so i can watch all of these advanced documentary from first world country and learn from them  as someone whose sole job is to market the 787 and a former aerospace engineer i am beyond impressed not only at the simple explanations of complex systems and concepts but the resourcefulness to get all the videos images documents that i myself have trouble finding at times the 1 hour nebula was well worth it as well two noteworthy systems incorporated on the 787 that did not make it in the video are mla maneuver load alleviation which reduces the loads experienced on the wing through the use of flight controls spoilers and tevc trailing edge variable camber where the wing camber is varied to improve drag superb job  suck on that a350  a fantastic jet in about 10 years for sure just a shame they locked it is early career success behind the swan dive dlc from boeing  great stuff i work on these daily as an aircraft technician always something new to learn about this plane btw are you supereyepatchwolf  serious shade thrown in this video  thank you  i am waiting for similar video about the 777 8 9 x  brian you need to do more editing on your videos as you are using the wrong words to describe crucial details i have noticed this in the last two videos and the part 2 of this video i watched on curiosity on the extreme braking test you described it as an aborted landing it is an aborted take off as an aside there is no such thing as an aborted landing it is referred to as a go around or balked approach sometimes aborted landing is used to describe a crash landing  i remember first reading about the 787 and how excited i was for that mostly just the carbon fiber body but i had no idea how much more advanced it was absolutely amazing sadly though i will likely never get a chance to fly on one due to where i travel for vacations very regional airlines  i think from memory a large part of the fact that the early airliners were so expensive was not just because of the tooling and production but also because they had to pay quite a lot of penalties to ana for the aircraft being a few tons overweight something which was not helped when they had to put the batteries in a steel box to prevent lithium ion thermal runaway great video i love the 787 the a350 is a lovely aircraft as well but it lacks the effortless grace and innovation of the 787 unfortunately the 787 is slightly tainted for me now because of the political ramifications it had in boeing which ultimately led to the max being built  funded by boeing obviously  trivia the small doors on the stabilizers were already removed on recent versions of 787 due to high failure rate and maintenance costs they just used the vacuum effect idk the correct term to expel the air that is sucked in by the small holes  let is goooo another r e vid  you know it is a great video when after 30 minutes of watching you are sad and surprised it is over because you thought only 10 minutes had passed very well done  this is a great video and definitely worth watching the nebula version i was studying aviation electronics and was asked why plane flies one of the answers can be oh you know different speed air on under the wing creates lift or if plane speed is high enough and attack angle i think most accurate is this planes fly because of money if there were no money nobody cared about aerodynamics nor improvements of it  the animation at 13 33 shows the over and under flows transiting the wing in equal time which is not what happens in reality  excellent educational video   laminar flow somewhere a wild destin perks up really great job on this learn to speak english and how to pronounce composite composite   say it out loud and exaggerate the sounds until you can consistently produce them  does not full piece sections mean it is impossible to repair you can not just replace small sections but have to remove the full body   26 40 based on how the max and their spacecraft turned out i would be a little hesitant to trust boeing when they say a safety system is not needed  amazing video these planes are beautiful but the 747 will always be my absolute favourite no plane can beat how beautiful the 747 is the queen of the skies for sure   4 59 that is not mount olympus that is brothers but close enough  i wonder if rivids even have an advantage in turulent flow like the divids on a golb ball reducing drag  so many of the airplanes you research have insane engineering but jokes aside your videos are captivating and i can not get enough one of my college buddies was chief flight test engineer on the 787 he frequently dlsclaims 7 eight 7 not three 7  i laugh at how you climate nuts ignore the manufacturing process involved in carbon fibre creation and how the enormous ovens are powered by flower petals  how do you even know some of these things it must be nice being smart  that aircraft is insane can not wait to see what goodies they cook up in the 797 or the 808 i do wonder are there any aerodynamic or other downsides to the supercritical wing aside from the complex shape  i have been on 787 for many times and i just love it  for your information 787 is rivalled by a330 neo not a350 b777 is rivalled by the a350  japanese engineering  tell old sean mcmanus i said hi will yah  was not expecting much but ended up being really engaging insane engineering series is one of the very few reasons to stay awake even after being up for almost a day  ahhh guess who has a nebula account lolol now it was totally worth it  make video on avionics too finally after 1 month i can sleep gotta clave it all can not wait till graphene finally makes it out in 2100 and makes stuff even better  this is all well and good as long as you are willing to share medical info and wear 6 masks the future of air travel is the most uncertain it is ever been  great content may i suggest insane engineering of x 43  the whole video sounds like you absolutely love this aircraft air does not accelerate  i watched the hour long version in nebula your channel is worth the whole subscription alone i do not know if i completely trust boeing  absolutely top notch research meanwhile a lot of airlines take those big beautiful windows at 5 40 and dims them fully for the entire flight  next mcas pls  no matter how much they try cleaning boeing is image it is not happening  height not heighth there is no h after the t  it is funny how i have nebula but i give up watching there because the video keeps buffering after watching this video i almost feel like i could become an aeronautics engineer thanks to this channel for doing the necessary research to provide us with an educational video that contains knowledge that we otherwise would not have known loving your work and i can not wait for part 2  787 may be an engineering marvel but narrower seats as configured in economy class by most airlines make it a major step back in terms of comfort  with the emphasis on using composite materials for strength and efficiency there is a drawback during a low velocity crash it was known that aluminum had a few minutes of resistance to fire which is why passengers have 90 seconds to evacuate an aircraft while carbon does not burn the resins do and can give of toxic smoke worse than aluminum skin since one of these composite aircraft have crashed or caught fire survival time is only a guesstimate  i would have liked to see some info about its greenhouse gases load in relation to more traditional designs  the reference to conor mcgregor is a oof  how is carbon fiber recycled  i like that the only ratio you care about is aspect ratio  seriously the amount of research put into this video is amazing great work and thanks for making this video  thanks for this i learned so much from this deep but elementary engineering explanation grateful to know more about the carbon composite material used and i can certainly appreciate and i celebrate boeing is willingness to roll the dice on the 787 it is a marvelously beautiful aircraft both in architecture and engineering but then i question the company is willingness to roll the dice when it comes to cutting costs on protecting the aircraft from lightning strikes how much could the thin strips of copper and insulation on those bolts really cost i do not work in the industry so i honestly do not know but it sounds like a cut coming after a cut coming after a cut i do get that filling the tanks with a non combustible gas is a safeguard against explosion but whatever happened to the notion that when miles above the earth it is a good idea to double up on safety when you can so if engineers know that attaching copper strips to the wings will neutralize lightning strikes and we know the extensive damage lightning can do to the aircraft as the video points out  and we know that lightning strikes are not an infrequent occurrence in aviation i am curious as to boeing is risk benefit calculation  oustanding video thank you  can not wait the engine video do the a350 as well the boeing cost savings measures will enivatably lead to problems down the line just the same motivations led to their max tragedies  the new generation the 787 is like 10 yrs old already lol not exactly revolutionary m8  this is quality content detailed amp informative narration accompanied by slight humor loved the mma references amazing work never thought going so in depth could be so interesting but you made it work once again one hour passes quickly on nebula one small feedback to nebula tho why is there no comment feature i do feel like reading the comments is an essential part of my youtube experience so i always have to check the youtube video as well  a lot of things seem to have insane engineering lol i know what aluminum is but what is aluminium big environmental costs to these old fashioned dirty habits hence the unintentional second meaning of insane in the clickbait despite the gorgeous i guess irish voiceover trying to imagine what one of those ovens does to the environment what is it like seven maybe eight percent of people alive have ever flown the other 92percent have to pay the health and environmental costs for their extravagance really only about three percent of humans doing this regularly socialize the costs to everyone else all the humans all the animals who cares right endless downwind costs of these dirty industries i too have loved engined flight in my time but it embarrasses me now that i participated in such a dirty way of being in the world we have giant sail tankers than can do a decent twelve miles an hour humans can do that it is time to ground all airlines if we wish to fly put a rogallo wing in a backpack climb a mountain and jump fifty years from now surviving humans will look at comments streams like this one and wonder if they knew they were insane why did they keep filthing the world  my jet with the highly efficient movement of fish upstream used too many vomit bags i only study aerospace to better understand his videos all good and all but this is boeing and they are in an incompetent phase of their life wow i am so impressed awesome video  the 787 is now my favorite plane insane at first aviation is all about luxury then speed then numerous passenger then cheap price rejected takeoff the word you were looking for was takeoff deciding to abort a landing is called going around and you do not use the breaks at all  can u make a video on how companies make super silent cars  the little orange doors are likely access panels for the turbos also also 24 05 threads in bearing  boeing cost cuttings cuz it went very well before i saw photos and videos from my job site on here and that brought a little pride to my janitorial job titanium itself is not expensive ounze by ounze titanium is ten times cheaper than iron what really is expensive is processed titanium for instance when machining to make those little titanium screws for dental implants a diamond is worn out every 20 minutes per tool  boeing chill also if you correct an tensile test curve for the lost area as the sample necks down that little hump goes away   5 40 says you  if its boing i ai not going  very beautiful plane  this was the video that made me sign up for curiosity stream great work  at 51 46 of the nebula video you said i am a masochist that wants you to feel the pain i felt during my thermodynamics lectures in college no brian that makes you a sadist the fact i seemed to enjoy it that makes me a masochist p great video by the way xd truly an engineering masterpiece  the engineers who worked on this plane are kings insanely smart shame about boeings management penny pinching and ruining the party  correction ultimate load is 150percent of limit load and limit load is the largest load that any aircraft across all in the fleet across all their lifetimes is expected to experience  best engineering channel ever  aeroelastic tailoring i do not know how i feel about my aircraft morphing like the transformers in mid flight i am a flight attendant for etihad almost all aircraft we have are 787s love working on them they are crew friendly one side of boeing is this 787 level another is boeing 747 max or star liner not less of engineering but a bit inadequate to meet the challenge  that sly mcgregor dig was so fuckin hilarious  i am blown away at the quality of this video thanks  great video  do the engines next  if nebula had a smart tv app id get it for sure watched the vid on nebula and i must say well done it is clearly visible that a lot of work is put in it would love more videos like this and for my money you can get even more technical with numbers calculations and graphs i just graduatet in mechanical so i might be biased tho  love these aerospace videos i am actually going to subscribe to curiosity steam to watch more keep it up  now taking prop bets for when re runs out of adjectives to put before engineering in titles amazing  carbon fiber is very energetically expensive to manufacture i would doubt it would ever save that energy over its lifetime like a lot of e vs they are not going to be better for the environment just continue the revenue stream for manufacturers   5 38 less farting is always nice butt  it is more of a frankenstein is monster than a plane  at 15 58 destin is laminar flow tingle just went off  reminder for you to sign in nebula boeing can not even connect the fuselage sections of the 787 correctly boeing should just get out of the aviation industry  really enjoyed the video watched on nebula i did notice that around 35min you seemed to be talking about aborted take offs not aborted landings as far as stressing the brake system youtube can be corrected before it is released on youtube unless i was misunderstanding what you were talking about  a350 feulsalage is aluminium  put a metal mesh in the composite to draw the lightning strikes  all well and good however like everything else now all this composite has no second life and will all wind up in a landfill where aluminum is easily recyclable that is a step backwards in sustainability  yeah no thanks boeing everything you do is now suspect  i know feet is the unit used in air traffic but i just can not relate to that so maybe always show feet and meter please   22 00 br nemark titanium implants ftw which boeing plane did bill nye work on  this is an incredible quality video and does a nice job of introducing animating complexing engineering principles keep it up my dude  always good  i return once again to request the insane engineering of the saturn v or starship  the critical aerofoil looks like the angle of thr venturi tunnel on gordon murrays new hypercar lmao how did this flying fire hazard revolutionize anything other then the lowest safety standards since the max  that batwing shape on the rear of the engines makes me think we are headed for a buck rogers or flash gordon future  pog omg your accent is amazing can you do one of the insane engineering of the 737 max where is the electricity for that wing heating system come from do they have batteries on board  i wonder how one would go about repairing any damage to the skin of the aircraft say a tail strike would a standard doubler plate work or would a more complicated procedure be needed  but my local airport has 0 flights to anywhere at the moment though that could have something to do with the runway maintenance  that is just the perfect title for a boeing after the incompetence of the 737max engineering now the insane engineering of the 787 im so reassured  man this is like a boeing informercial did boeing sponsor you you should ask them for money they may pay   15 56 destin sandlin has entered the chat  the a350 is not an aluminum airliner in fact it has more composites than the b787 and has less aluminum lol boeing bias is real this is a good commercial makes me want to buy one  carbon fibre reinforced plastics sure thats not recyclable  please do insane engineering of nasa x 43  this is so awesome even better than some documentary films guys share and engage in it so we could get more make it worth it for this guy  video should have been titled the insane quality control issues of the 787 let is do our homework next time brian   boeing name has sufferd serius damages both in arline and space industry  this was a brilliant video i am going to check out nebula as i need to see more of this looking at boeing its probably dangerous airplane  i would appreciate subtitles on the nebula version of this video  typical boeing shill i just want you to know i will not buy one of your crappy 787s anyway  incredible video  this is such a pretty plane then the a350 talking about the carbon aluminum issue immediately made me think of my mountain bike that has a carbon fiber frame and aluminum rear triangle not to mention aluminum bearings everywhere i wonder if this is something that bike manufactures think of or do they just ignore it and hope to sell you a new one when your old one falls apart  amazing content i am always so impressed by the quantity and quality of the stock footage read engineering and real science have  the fact that these videos can be this good with this much information with 1 2 a month i feel like i am watching a video that broadly covers what we have been working on in my flight structures course up next the insane engineering of the 737 max real corporate pr would be a much more suitable name for your channel yes the engineering is insane when they do not make the plane properly cough charleston cough  787 is going to be the last achievement of boeing for a longtime  damn i love this video ngl when you started talking about the hush hush laminar flow mechanisms i genuinely felt hot under the collar  nothing more interesting than trade secrets  i want to become a mechanic huge fan of the channel i am a professional mech eng but the insight is always insightful to me accurate and relevant love these guys keep doing what you are doing amazing content   been there done that  great video anyone else have immediate nostalgia of the chicken cannon from mythbusters  boop  yeahhhh i was waiting for the next insane engineering video  unsubscribed do not recommend channel engineering is not insane and your clickbait bullshit will not feature in my feed from now on engineering is the very definition of sane  you have to admire the aesthetics that the engineering can achieve 787 has been my favourite airliner of all time since she was created no one can reject that sexy curvature  truly awesome video thanks  why do you call it insane looks pretty sane to me  bro i searched cha cha real smooth why did thiiiis come up lmaoo there was electrically heated anti ice de ice systems well before this as well as boundry layer air control systems back in the 50s and onward  can you do one on the airbus a220 or should i say the bombardier c series this aircraft seems to be very popular  can you do a video about akinci uav   direct flights are becoming more frequent than ever so you don t have to use hubs brazilians having to change flights at congonhas airport at 6pm on a friday why direct flights i love share the same place with another 253645585 passengers on an airport that is literally nicknamed as aircraft carrier  talking about metals the lesser one is the victim anode  simply impressive and amazing can not state how thankful i am to your great effort and informative documentaries about civil aviation i will wait the next part with excitement  such a high quality video thanks so much  the wings have speed holes in them   you should do a video on the a350 or one comparing them the production value is stunning you need netflix deal or something  great video but at 11 53 is not the rigtht left from the planes perspective wing vortex spinning the wrong direction  excellent video as always many people do not realise what a step forward the 787 was in terms of technologies employed the li ion battery was unheard of for a start and the elimination of the offtake bleed as you briefly alluded to was also cutting edge at the time i work for a major engine manufacturer and i can tell you eliminating the bleeds and having over half a megawatt of electrical generation capability certainly had some interesting consequences but the benefits are worth the hassle electrical ecs means the 787 will be immune to the impending organophosphate lawsuits in the aviation industry for starters  the graphics in this video are impeccable  why not in metric  wow 30 mins and i am going to enjoy every single one of it wow what an absolute unit of a carbon piece i can definitely believe it but still pretty crazy they are making the huge parts from carbon like that wonder how the costs work with that compared to just casting alumiunium or whatever they used to be made of  great video  seems like it would be cheaper to just make the haul solid and then put screens inside as windows  with live cameras lol oh great boeing said they are not needed we can trust their judgement on safety systems i am sure  awesome awesome content thanks what gives with the map in the beginning looks like 3 of the flight paths mysteriously dropped off when changing from the left side to the right   love your videos  great video of a fantastic airliner minor correction 787 was developed to replace the 767 not 777  excellent scientific documentary tons of information in a single video  i appreciate that part 2 will be on youtube albeit a touch later kudos to you  most beautiful video you have ever created i wont fly on one neither will employees who built em  china is going to chew up and spit out boeing in the next 10yrs boeing has a culture problem for 20 yrs  wait his is not a wendover video  am i the only one that gets nervous now when i hear that boeing is innovating with economics in mind  the mountain shown is not mount olympus it is the brothers 6866 ft  wonder how many lives are going to be lost due to boeing is cost cutting this time   22 05 norsk titanium norwegian titanium norsk is the norwegian word for norwegian  nebula is cool and all but not everyone got a credit card fascinating video once again as an engineer myself i can say that you really provide some of the best scientific content all over youtube no doubt thank you so much after the max8 fiasco i am not sure boeing should be trusted with what is and is not safe enough  the best part of these videos is listening to him say but  do elon musk is new and better starship design  boeong is so confy compared to the airbus however boeings track record  great video as always  thank you for telling me there is a longer version on nebula at the beginning i keep getting told at the end of the video by other creators and i am like i want to watch but i do not want to watch the video over again  humans racing to destroy the earth as fast as humanly possible to get a cheap plane ticket to some low brow tourist attraction  yo i like your videos but i really wish you would stop calling things insane  the mariocultleader is impressed by how wendover productions has managed to hack into real engineering is account and perfectly replicate his voice  i normally do not comment but this was such a good video lt 3  2 10 why not choose gold or platinum would sure look nice  i have not been a big fan of boeing for a while now between the 737max and their hilariously sad attempts at space flight they have not really earned much respect from me that said the 787 is such an incredible piece of engineering and a beautiful one at that   double checks to see if i am watching wendover  a masterclass well done sir  i guess the 96 some odd dislikes are the rabid macgregor fans  at 7 28 you were talking about the rivets in the aircraft outer shell but do these really impact the efficiency at all  i preflight test and deliver them  okay this plane has earned the title the insane engineering of  fascinating stuff  i for one was someone who could see the bright future of the dreamliner when it was first announced  and the demise of the a380 even before its first flight i have travelled transatlantic in the 787  the best long haul flight i ever experienced   you make weaving all the very technical information into a interesting and understandable story seem easy  its eratic not erotic  carbon fiber is allowing us to literally make wings that respond to needs of the aircraft like evolution does for birds except this time it only takes a few months and some engineers instead of thousands of years of natural selection  i am guessing the high aspect ratio eliminated the need for winglets at the wingtips in shipbuilding we use a sacrificial anode a small block that gets eaten awayduring the livetime of the vessal would have been a lot cheaper for boeing to use it aswell i think  unfortunately the increased cost of repairing damage due to having to replace parts rather than fabricating a repair and downtime caused by waiting on replacement components from boeing has been far outweighing any efficiency savings more airlines have been cancelling their 787 orders due to this there is also the issue with longevity and salvage as most of these aircraft will not be able to continue service as cargo aircraft once their airframes time out  meh for everything they did right with the 787 they clicked undo with the max benefit what benefit sits are getting cramped aisles are narrowe small tiny narrow bodies that bumps around in the sky more i wish we strived to keep and expand wide bodies of 777 class at least 787 sales are not nearly as high to warrant talking about benefits  28 20 that is a penis watched the nebula version well presented but i was surprised that you chose to ignore the lunch engine manufacturer of the 787 rolls royce rr rr worked with boeing to perfect the vast majority of the new amp revolutionary systems that your documentary presented so well i found this a strange omission from was a well presented fact based presentation perhaps uncovering a trend in your journalism  good video you should have discussed the 787 is landing gear a bit as well it uses novel materials and design concepts  i wonder how many cookies cakes pies you could bake in that oven  why does the a350 have smaller windows than the 787 is not it is fuselage also built of composite materials  where does all the fuel go how much does that much fuel weigh  ew boeing  watching your first videos on aircraft literally altered my career plans i am now 7 months away from graduating an aerospace engineer you are having a big impact on many future engineers please keep doing more aircraft videos they are absolutely amazing  its kind of sad in a way the days of interesting different planes are nearly gone to be replaced by planes that are just all the same as each other we really are headed for a boring world with nothing much of great interest why all the weird references to american sport  i would complain about the equivalent altitude pressure at the beginning not being in metric but it is about aircraft and they measure in funny numbers too so you get a pass this time  boeing is all about the money they do not give a damn about passenger safety see the max disasters  carbon fiber will show some flaws and cost lives in future no doubt about it it is a new material and less time tested also boeing cannot be trusted the model has failed  fascinating plane i think this is the peak of this form factor until delta wings become popular  i think insane is a poor choice of words great video tho  you should do one on the a350 hydraulic fluid dissolves cfrp the 787 cools its hydraulic fluid by pumping it through radiators in the fuel tanks cfrp fibers wick water through capillary action very efficiently freeze thaw freeze thaw freeze thaw crack cfrp has awesome tensile strength compression strength not so much hence the shim issues have a nice flight i did 7 up 7 down test just now  i am a bit confused as to why carbon fiver is not used in more industries  14 25 you are missing a closed parenthesis after supercritical how would it fly dive ushakov lpl   16 07 actually i find laminar flow quite erotic  real engineers do not use feet  wait how is it using more fuel with the bleed system i thought it uses the exhaust gas as the plane is de icing system  when he said titanium i was waiting for him to say this part of 787 is made out of vibranium  when the batteries caught fire boeing engineers installed a fire containment vessel vented to atmosphere for the batteries for safety reasons in plain english they installed a fire place and built a chimney for the batteries  the insane engineering and poor execution of the 787 did they fix that mcas software issue causing the plane to think it was pitching up and forcing the nose down eventually into the ground killing everyone  you speak of the huge list of changes with reverence when really each drastic change just stacks up more and more risk boeing is willing to take the design into completely unknown territory to save some fuel  the 787 program is so expensive because they outsourced most of its r amp d when it was time to assemble the first prototype the parts did not even align  ive had the curiositystream nebula bundle for a year is there a way to refresh it i can refresh my cs subscription but i do not get nebula anymore and can not seem to refresh my nebula subscription on its own either i really liked my flight in the 787 3 years ago with one exception from vancouver to frankfurt my journey was constantly with sun shining on my window that only had a liquid crystal panel to darken the outside it made it unpractical i remember the initial development of the boeing 787 dreamliner being an absolute fiasco in every sense of the word possible in addition i have heard of airlines straight up refusing to accept deliveries of the 787 from the boeing north carolina plant because of abhorrent quality and technical issues while an engineering marvel on its own it is indeed a wonderful plane but boeing is past implementation and construction of these aircraft is questionable  what happened to using metric system  hope they put more than 1 aoa sensor on this model if any at all  you sound irish are you irish  but can it flap it is wings  i waited a lot for a new video of real engineering it is totally worth it  i wonder if musk was influenced by the development of the 787 carbon fibre architecture when spacex initially planned to build the starship out of carbon fiber  tldr on why there is so much titanium compared to aluminum with the carbon fiber hey now hey now now avoid galvinic corrosion for me or whatever sisters of mercy said how is using combustion heat to power the jet engine which powers a generator which powers heating blankets to heat the wing more efficient then using combustion heat to heat the wing  i worked on the development of the nacelle at rolls royce derby for the 787 from fan blade off to etops and it was amazing for 7yrs repairing and rigging the nacelle for test amazing life achievement to be part of the aircraft  i wonder how they handle fire  this is very interesting very good just another aerospace engineer fanboying real engineering videos what an amazing plane beautiful very nice and informative plz also discuss helicopter designs and advance features of helicopters eg aw 139 i wonder how the impact resistance of carbon fiber would be during a crash if it presents more danger to the occupants inside are crashes in carbon fiber frame planes more or less survivable  also make vedio about airbus a350 i love this plane it is stunningly beautiful both visually and technically just when real engineering was needed most he came back with the video for the boeing 787  1 5 gees for 3 seconds you gotta be kidding should be more than that  nice aircraft but what is also really insane has been the lack of quality control in boeing is 787 assembly line early on airlines sent them back finding among other things random junk left inside panels avionics bays and fuel tanks more recently under faa scrutiny multiple new issues with manufacturing have shown up would be interesting to do a video on what they have done to improve the leadership culture since the 737 max scandal   spent 5 years manufacturing the nacelle components for this plane it is definitely an engineering marvel  finally an episode about cutting edge commercial aviation plane this is a great late night before sleep video for me im just gonna comment here so the algorithm boosts this vid because you deserve more attention with the amount of work that goes into making these videos d keep it up  do carbon composites have to be made from plastic i am thinking a lot about a plane design that uses titanium for the skin would that benefit from this  i know that body of the 787 is great however i cannot believe how the very same boeing who designed 777 is workspace also designed 787 is interior and workspace comparing to 777 it just sucks free space storage space ergonomics all worse than 777 except automated windows bigger overhead bin space per passenger and better air conditioning being smaller than 777 does not justify its interior design flaws we can see how better it can be when we look at a350 for example  is this the same plane with mcas issues  where is the 4k quali  literally like every aerospace engineer at my college watches this channel religiously nothing is gonna get done today except watching this video lol   that is the same height as mt olympus in washington state shows image of the brothers mountain which is more than 1 000 ft lower  the boeing 787 is truly a masterpiece of aviation it is by far my most favorite airplane  your videos are good but damn slow paced similar to a snail is speed but worse you just keep on stretching a topic until it becomes stale amp boring even though it can be explained in less than half that time just as you explained about newer techniques resulting in 25percent 50percent lesser wastage of titanium you yourself should try better techniques so that you waste 25percent 50percent less time of the viewers please do not get me wrong your videos are superb but please take this as a positive criticism  woah incredible random mcgreggor dig so you are tellimg me that we could hypothetically make a composite material from human based on it having similar characteristics to carbon fibre albeit definitely not as strong or even close however i wonder if anyone knows if it is possible  naaah not realy the 737 and the a320 has actually revolutionised travel the 787 has only merely replaced 767 and a330 while making a profit for the airlines there are only a handful of airlines who use it as was advertised by boeing  from what i remember rivets do not create any bumps on aircraft fuselage fun fact about the 787 if you do not restart it for 248 days all power generator control units will enter failsafe mode simultaneously leading to complete loss of power and hence loss of control presumably this is due to integer overflow since 2 31 1 100 seconds 248 days  so the 787 has titanium fasteners that are potentially vulnerable to fatigue cracking early in their life let me guess that faa approval was pre 2020 and the wings are now more vulnerable to lightning strikes just that these days boeing engineers saying a cost cutting measure is safe does not inspire a huge amount of confidence  great video do you plan on doing the same thing with the a350 a380  wing warping returns  this old and the tech is still secret awesome  kind of sucky theym removing safety measures to cut costs gad damn this was a good video i mean i did not understand half of it but i sure enjoyed it  conor mcgregor is shortened carrier look how far one joke from a science guy can go  awesome i always learn something new from your videos  please shut up about bones wow this was an amazing video just like every other video on you are channel thanks for this amazing content your producing and keep doing whatever your doing because your amazing at it looking forward for the power system video  how safe is this in case of a engine failure  hmm i wonder if they would have better aerodynamics if when printing the fuselage they added small pits to the surface like a golf ball   real engineering your channel is the best one i have found on youtube so far keep up the good work it is really fascinating and saddening to see how much technology changed over the past 20 years and it seems they always go unnoticed  so informative thank you for you consistently amazing videos   5 34 gotta say that did not work for me  still a tube wing design boring  boeing argues these expensive features were not needed like redundant sensors properly written software and pilot training  the 787 windows are great for the 20 minutes the cabin crew let you look out of them  on the nose rivets can contribute to a lot of parasitic drag but further back they are in the boundary layer and barely make a difference you will notice that on russian fighters they only bother with flush rivets on the front of the airplane  boeing ahah funny try again  wire based 3d printing is just a fancy term word a welding robot stacking beads  didnt expect the connor mcgregror references lmao yeah metals are capable of kind of failing cfrp either fails catastrophically or it does not fail do not get me wrong i am a huge carbon fibre fan just facts are facts  such a high quality video  i do not trust boeing engineering at all poor quality control   0 40 they did not do this for me and my needs they did it for their shareholders i need them to revolutionize air travel it would be insane if they built hydrogen or electric planes  uh a350xwb so much superior  came from the nebula version to ask does the change in cabin air source stop fume events  the secret doors in the tail are for removing any tequila bottles that may have been left in there  thank you people are fortunate to get such high quality content for free  it is carbon not carbon fiber which can cause corrosion in aluminum i remember reading about someone who drew a circle on the aluminum skin of an airplane years later that circle caused that part of the skin to fall out  awesome video  been flying it for four years really enjoy it overall a great plane not perfect but very good now training on the a220 another cutting edge aircraft  to prevent the titanium powder from flying off and forming bubbles would not it help for them to be welded in a vacuum or that will not work you know to prevent less particle movement  also the larger windows are irrelevant because the crews just black them all out and crank up the cabin altitude in the hopes that you will go to sleep and not bother them  thanks wendover exists we noticed lol nice i hope there will also be a similar episode on the a350  why are smarter everyday and veritasium not here in the comments  that is weird except the greedy airlines do not use that extra hull strength to provide comfortable cabin altitudes for the customers they still barely pressurize to the legal limit of 10k and just pocket the extra savings in fuel and fuselage longevity it is all about profit in every case  why are smarter everyday and veritasium not here in the comments  that is weird as someone that follows sully sullenberger on social media i must say i agree with his notion that over automation on the flight deck is a step in the wrong direction we need to allow more human input in modern aircraft and depend less on computer algorhitms a perfect example of this is a video here on yt called pilot betrayed  i am listening to this as i am prepping for an exam for my aerospace engineering course lol the insane quality of the real engineering channel  i wonder where the board of boing safed money to pay the fda and fill their own pockets basically that is all what the board of boeing can do  mi favourite a c  another excellent video   boeing the fuckers behind the 346 boeing737max passenger deaths profitbeforepeople  very nice video super informative as always one small note aerospace composites are cured in an autoclave not an oven this is important because it makes scalability even more challenging 1bar is not much until it is over a surface area the size of a fuselage  correct me if i am wrong but that super critical wing shape shifts the center of lift around back and forth at around critical mach it is designed to be only optimized at above critical mach but it would be unstable when you are constantly going above and below the critical mach which happens to be the cruising speed of passenger jets what am i missing   hey can you do a video to try to get people traveling again we are losing a lot of money over here this might be the most hailcorporate video i have ever seen and my unsubscription  talk about trains it was not cracks in mc gregor bones that retired him it was the cracks in his ego from the beating he took from nurmokhamedov can confirm the 787 is more susceptible to lightning than any other airliner i work on every time one comes in for a heavy engineering visit there would always be multiple pits caused by lightning above the cockpit as well as the bottom of the fuselage fortunately most are tiny requiring only a blending of the pitted area more severe cases get blended down followed by a fresh layer of mesh and resin  awesome thanks the 787 is an impressive machine but have to admit the a350 is just a little quieter and roomy on the inside fascinating  cracks in the mcgroger is legs shortened his career lol massive  fantastic video   aluminium  i think i need to go on nebula i am an airline pilot and the bleed free systems is incredibly intriguing to me i flew the e175 for years and as much as i love that plane bleed related malfunctions was one of the most common maintenance delays i saw one caveat to the ice protection stuff the electrical does not mean the 787 would not need external deicing on the ground it still only protects the leading edges in traditional planes ground idle on the engines is indeed only enough for cabin air conditioning it can not optimally heat the wings but the biggest issue is that freezing precipitation falls onto the plane coating everything including the upper wing surfaces which are not protected by virtue of high speed flight through weather heating only the leading edge is necessary for flight if freezing precipitation is actively falling they use deice fluid followed by high viscosity anti ice fluid that sticks to the wings until takeoff there is actually a lot more to deicing but that is a whole discussion unto itself  i feel like you did the f 35 dirty with is the f 35 worth dollar115 million it should have been the insane engineering of the f 35  not watching here nebula nebula get on it less farting is nice indeed cheers to that though lol  mcgregor broke his leg on an elbow and im pretty sure the cracks in the leg was just an excuse  one of the most intriguing videos i have seen on this channel very surprising to me that boeing went through with these radical changes keep up the great work hahahahah the connor mcregor joke too bad boeing is insane engineering is overshadowed by their even more insane manufacturing and quality control boeing is name and reputation are not the best in the public is eye at the moment  the lost apollo mission apollo venus flyby sr2  why is the audio so fast and clipped it bis impossible to enjoy  anytime on real engineering the insane engineering of agent 47  i am sure that you leaving your one job has helped thousands decide on or even get their first job thank you for your hard work this video was great  hahahaha a great conor mcgregor joke jai shri ram here they go again with that insane claim why is it insane  fyi music was a tad too loud at the end for my taste real engineering blink twice if wendover productions is holding you at gunpoint  excellent video about 787 use mask and vaccinate yourself before going to airplane public service message by the creators of cool videos  787 and a350 are my favorite airliners i feel like i am being sold something i built the other engine housing cowl great feeling to know your work is up in the sky for centuries  the mcgregor comment has me ded so what do my pilots out there think about cessna 172 is ya think in 50 years it will have a carbon fiber fuselage and wings or will it still be held together by sheet metal thinner than my toenail and going for 1mill usd new  i might be very very very biased but imagine a video on the a 220 or the avro arrow  lmfao the mcgregor shade was completely unexpected but absolutely perfect hopping in a 787 in a few hours great timing fantastic video thank you this was a very informative and enjoyable video fun fact many of the concepts discussed in this video are also considered in the design of tall building structures  i was actually able to tour the boeing plant that produces this plane it was one of the inspirations for me wanting to go into aerospace engineering mcgreggor watching this in his downtime hey come on  i love that image 1 24  the 4 people who disliked this video lol no words this channel is amazing  i love your vids never stop next time how the legendary mclaren f1 was born xd  7 36 this is not how the type of rivets used on a plane looks they sit flush with the skin as to not induce drag check this video  these innovations sound great i guess twenty years from now we will find out how well they worked  we do not forget boeing 737 max  the 787 has some major issues the carbon fibre has aluminium wires in it to conduct for static reasons on a large amount of 787 aircraft parked up during 2021 they are having corrosion of these carbon fibre composite components due to the aluminium inside the composite these components need to be replaced at a major cost in the millions usually  i wish they had not painted the carbon fiber i just subscribed to the curiosity bundle 4k video can not wait to get home as an aerosexual with a career in aviation i did not expect to learn much from this video but even topics that i am already aware of go more in depth than anything i have seen thank you  next airbus a350 please citing a quality manager at boeing for 28 years john barnett but as far as the 787 i would change flights before i would fly a 787 i have told my family please do not fly a 787 fly something else try to get a different ticket i want the people to know what they are riding on nothing else to say  amazing engineering and amazing video  did not we were suppose to go to zero carbon economy and life meaning death  did not expect those out of the blue mma references but i apreciate them excellent video  lol and half of the boeing employees avoid flying on them due to build quality  what accent is this welsh  now i need a video about that 350xwb  i missed not having a comparison of fuel burned per hour so i googled it 777 series typically consumes between 6 080 and 7 500 liters of fuel per hour depending on the variant meanwhile for the 787 this figure is generally between 4 900 and 5 600 liters per hour capacity 787 9 296 passengers 777 up to 388 the 787 is 24percent smaller than the 777 and burns around 22percent less fuel per hour than the 777 series hey real engineering can you please do video of a train that jamaica can use cause our taxis are somewhat dangerous they often do very dangerous stunts like diving in opposite lane wich risks a accident and what kind of bus jamaica could use tldr taxis are dangerous here do you know of a type of train or bus to replace or lessen taxis i remember being fascinated by 2 next gen planes back then as a kid first being the a380 and the other is the 787 was still called 7e7 at the time   o thanks for your generosity  great video one does not experience self transcendence the illusion of self only dissipates   composite materials are made of two or more materials  you do not say  when you said at the beginning that you loved the plane i could already guess that carbon fiber had something to do with it  that mcgregor joke had me in bits  ngl a conversation about this exact topic popped up for me this afternoon thanks for the answers  exactly what i have been waiting for for 2 weeks why is it that airlines do not want to have planes built in the south of us this plane scares the for me sorry for bad english if you forget a350 yes i just woke up and did a real engineering marathon when this video came out another long video woo  awesome video i am an engineer and my dad is a pilot he is very skeptical of this plane but openly admits he does not understand the tech i occasionally dabble in explaining the benefits to him but this is brilliant he will love this video thanks  you using that word insane that does not mean what you think it means  i love how you can tell that he was almost breaking out laughing while saying less farting is always nice  this video was brought to you by boeing i am a fucking nerd and i learned a bunch of shit thanks  154  i was almost anticipating this video is sponsored by boeing   blueoceanevent  as someone that does not fly well i did not know the 787 was designed to be pressurized to be more comfortable something slightly better for me  completely shocked at that mcgregor vs dustin poirier reference great engineering incompetent leadership carbonfiber on a bmw i3 deteriorate after 5 years so 5 year life span  787 s will revolutionize the way planes will be constructed in about 20 years probably    i love this 787 if you consider that the carbon fiber is a revolution in itself so the ferrari must be the greatest revolution of the century  i said it to biden for great men great projects we need a profound and imminent reform to be able to relaunch the american industry before it is too late and cinema is not going to save the americans

industry before it is too late and cinema is not going to save the americans  the 60 minute nebula version is here part two will launch on youtube in the next week  brian can you make a video about spacex rockets and videos about lockheed martin fighter jets because i love them  care bun fye bar  i love planes i just wish flying did not suck so much doubt i will ever get to fly on one of these i can read the writing on the wall at least i can remember flying pre 9 11 just get on and go in a few more years the next generation will be saying i can remember flying without having to whip out my phone for some sort of id  great video with so many implications for the future  mcmanus vs mcgregor 2021 you called him out  i am not so sure the 787 is the dream it is marketed as   but when will airline costs go down  shame with what boeing is facing now in their recent quality control issues on the 787 nice i spend a lot of time from 10 pm to 12 pm watching your videos actually didnt expect the 787 to be in the same playlist as the sr 71 and the a 10 and x 15 the 787 is by far the most comfortable airplane i have ever flown in something something wendover planes i am okith from sri lanka i watched all of your videos and i learned a lot from this videos do a vid on starship 20th before even watching it i love the 787 and i want to fly on it one day that is an absolute dream of mine  cracked at fortnite my guy hey brian i love and love all your videos and your channel is one of my favourite already watched this  the video is amazing as always  modern aircraft design is incredible  dreamliner  good thank you so much for this video love your videos  coolio 2nd view comment and like first i was just having breakfast lol 2nd view comment and like 2nd view comment and like 2nd one  2nd first  ummm  2017  4 engines a380 or 747 8 have better performance in landing and take off in air much the same as 787 9 i will like to ride 747 9 in the future  but you are mistaken when you have made in the plane of dreams where to place the legs very close to the dining table  when the chair turns into a bed is not comfortable because what is required to table rises slightly it is so stupid why boeing made the 787 and 747 it just wasted their money  am glad emirates bought none  start   airbus is better just saying beautiful aircraft  great videoooo  warning boeing a330neo is coming   airbus is the best i was just wondering why at the rear of the engine cowling there is serrated edges  that is a beautiful airplane you can tell that machine wants to fly  boeing you are so awesome i love all your models and every flight aboard them because i know that they are built with magic  wow so amazing  im an airbus fan but this plane is awesome good job boeing and airbus amazing and beautiful aircraft can be no other than boeing mann i love these planes i have a question i can see a cone dragged by vertical stabilizer of the plane what is that  what a gorgeous plane  not even remotely on the same level as an air bus a 380 once again americans thinking everything they do is the best in the world it is a beautiful airplane tdih boeing 787 8 dreamliner maiden flight december 15 2009 i want boeing 797 d a350 is better what a beautiful aircraft and video boeing is the best mind if i ask what song is this  such a beautiful airplane how much decibel does the 787 produce  safety protocol for test flights  r i p quality  wow if i were working for your company i would have plan on building a faster lighter fuel efficiency with less noise impact strictly for your company but i am just a kid this is a beautiful plane an exquisite design i love when the boeing crew started shouting and clapping nice video  gear down inflight on a promotional video hmmm i think performance would have been optimum bad practise in anyones book  this is the plane of the boss  why is he flying with his gear up i know that there are three different varieties of the 787 passenger aircraft the 787 8 dreamliner 787 9 and the 787 10 from what i understand these numbers relate to the overall passenger capacity of the aircraft and i was wondering as to whether or not you would be able to provide me a list of the confirmed orders for each variation and which airlines have placed these orders i would be truly grateful  fantastic job boeing a truly gorgeous plane that i will hopefully be travelling on if thomson airways gets their plane soon the 747 and 737 have got to be the most popular passenger planes with airlines around the world without a doubt the 737 and 747 are the most recognisable aircraft of the modern aviation era and i have to say that i am extremely pleased to see that you are improving them with the 737 max 747 8 intercontinental and of course the truly gorgeous 787 dreamliner why was the gear always down  someday   they made it they could dot it  how do you guys make these big planes  yes please do also please check out our boeing stores facebook page for more photos and news about boeing  can we share this on facebook  u mean the a320 air show  omg its so beautiful  boeing first flight suites and ties airbus first flight jumpsuit and parachute  ja60370 i have a feeling it will not be long  do the landing gears go up  thanks we are delivering the first 787 to ana later this year ana will develop their flight schedule soon after please see the description for the video boeing 787 to test for service readiness for a link to ana is web site with more information  nice airplane can you please tell me when is 787 first commercial flight \n",

      "looks like a set out of the star trek shows  looks closer to the orville for some reason   trek loved flat walls even with round bulkheads orville goes all in on round everything also way more integrated lighting  to me it looks like  it is clearly colonial one  my first thought too  came here to say this this is the only time this aircraft will have adequate seating space  i was thinking the same thing yup the perfect amount of legroom   how much legroom do you want sir  yes  787 bowling alley could be fun 0g bowling i will pitch in dollar10 to make it happen i forget what airport this is at cool exhibit you can walk thru not an entire plane though  they have a two at schiphol airport amsterdam the netherlands one fokker 100 on the roof and another plane at the giftshop of klm  while it is a cool relic the fokker 100 can not be compared to this also the gift shop with the dc 9 in klm colors is cool but its also not a klm gift shop just a small aviation themed shop  been to schiphol so many times and i have never seen this will keep an eye out for it next time  same but i usually have tight connections so there is no time to go looking around either  wait you can get into the fokker i see it every time i am there it is a real plane i personally worked on it i got to work on parts for it but rarely got to see anything that looks like a plane they did give us a tour of 003 after it came down to get painted near my site though that was cool they had it set up as a demo plane with various configurations no you did not   i worked at that plant for 7 years in production test and flight line i can take a pic of the little token we were given when line 46 the first 8 through final assembly flew when i get home tonight not like i spent my time taking timestamped pics of myself inside the factory though  do not waste your time just because you worked there does not prove this is a real plane  what a boring fucking life you have got  i think my life has been quite the page turner i own a music studio now i believe they were replying to the douche that was committed to not believing you oh wow so you legit just do not think planes like this ever flew or existed got it found a link for you  i think he means this exact one in the image  so do i you can literally see the wings and tarmac out the windows bigger version of the same pic further down in the comments sigh  where are the rails that should be in the floor for all of the seats then  here is when i piped in on this a few years back someone else had the same question there is also the same top comment  edit you might not click that the seats do not start til aft of door 3 behind that wall in the middle of the isle at the next set of doors they are covered up by the carpet forward of that  do people think the carpet is supposed to go in after the seats i do not understand how the lack of seat rails would suggest the plane is not real  they are all smart enough to know the seat rails have to be there because it is part of the planes structure but can not fathom those rails are just under the carpet there is a higher res photo down thread where you can clearly see trees and wings outside of the windows  so much room for activities  boats and ho is  hide and seek  so much room for unhappy people  i always wanted my private jet with a bowling alley  so many activities it is making my head spin how many activities we could do just for the record that is what will ferrell actually said on step brothers consider it the  safety aside that looks way more fun  that would make a perfect vomit comet  something about ultimate corporate pickleball team building retreats  non potato version here  my new background image thanks   200 000 units are ready with another million more on the way    this one i think is owned by a saudi prince which was supposed to replace his aging b767 300 sure but it is not the same pic your link has the seat rails in the floor  this reminds me of the story told me by my former father in law who is a 777 pilot for delta he was asked to pick up one of the new planes from boeing field and bring it back to atlanta he and the copilot brought their wives with with them the inside was like this with no seats and the ladies were to sit in the jump seats during takeoff the guys are jacked they had no load and requested to do an unrestricted takeoff and we are given permission to do so my mother in law had strapped her self in as they taxied but the copilot is wife kept farting around exploring while they taxied to the runway well the guys did not announce that they were getting ready to takeoff and she was still standing my mil said that this woman went ass over tea kettle in her skirt the complete length of the plane till she hit the bulkhead at the back she said she never laughed so hard in her life the other woman got up quite indignant and stomped her way up to the front of the plane to yell at the two men it is always such a visual story that anytime i see a picture like this that is all i can picture is this 50 year old woman rolling with her skirt over her head down the whole length  i worked on it it is not a mock up i give a little chuckle every time i see this post and the resulting it is just a model comments it is a real 787 9 on the factory flight line in south carolina again i worked on it you can see the flight line outside through the darkened windows just aft of the exit doors there is a non potatoe version of the pic further down in the comments but the middle baggage bins do not start till door 3 you are looking at doors 2 i watched a qa hit his head on the back of that fasten seat belt sign and it had to be replaced it was going to a private buyer who was going to gut it anyway so there was basically no interior felt big enough to play a soccer game inside edit apparently i should include this link confirming that business jets were indeed delivered like this and using this same pic from 2014  is this one of the dubai frames i initially thought zb299 but that is an everett frame so it is not that  rumor had it it was for the mexican president at the time i do not remember what the line numbers were around that time or i would gladly tell you this was over 5 years ago mind you i really wanna say that at the time we at sc were the first only ones building the 9 they overdid it with the legroom on this one  reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey it looks like a space ship i dig it to be honest i really dislike the lack of control over the window brightness on the 787 dreamliner why can not the cabin crew allow passengers to see beautiful city lights in the middle of the night  there is control over window opacity maybe yours did not work properly  true and at select times it did work however it seems the cabin crew have the ability to lock the opacity at particular settings i totally get that at dusk and dawn not in the pitch black night  maybe my airline just did not use that feature  cabin crew can take full control of all windows on 787 regardless of individual settings  i like the 787 a lot but this bugs me too took a red eye to europe and could not see greenland at all  true sometimes you just want to keep a tiny bit open to see the skies because most people want to sleep what is the square footage want to see how the size compares to a house  well the cabin itself is 18 feet wide  beautiful design and yet they still find a way to make economy class as miserable as possible funny how one airline is 17 30 seat is more comfortable and spacious than another airline is 17 31 seat  so much room for activities  reminds me of the mockup at kiah in 2011 here is some blackberry photos i took note the continental airlines lol  dang now it looks like a hallway in a ship built by gutamaya some of you will understand this i swear  wow that still looks super modern i want to run around it i want to put a king sized bed at the very back some couches on the sides that is my kind of plane  this has to be in the top 10 of reposts by now right  so much room for activities  can we make bunk beds  this is what dreams are made of that time of year for this post again  put a band at one end some high tables along the side epic dance club whenever i see this photo i think about how i would layout the interior if it were my own dreamliner  welcome to air india so much room for activities  so much space for activities  i think this is the one owned by a saudi prince and i think it was stored in switzerland next to his late father b747 8i  they could not find a buyer for it totally empty he has a b767 300 with a u s registration still active 787 freighter when  probably in another five years when the epa forces boeing to halt 767f and 777 200f production due to tightening engine emissions standards  i wanna see jackass try to play dodgeball in there while it is dive bombing and shit  i wanna throw a pijamas party in this space with just pillows and blankets and a bunch of friends maybe some buzz so much room for activities  so much room for activities  straight out of star trek  i would have guessed an interior mockup no seat tracks  the panel above your seat with the air and the attendant call button is so high in the center you can not reach it sitting down let is try not putting the middle seats in this one and just see how it works out i honestly do not think we need them i think you mean alien spaceship with all them dam seats it makes it look so much smaller when empty and open like that it looks like a dream so much room for activities so much space for activities  captains log supplemental d man imagine being rich enough to get one and kit it out yourself would be so freaking awesome  guess we sitting on the floor then idea for new sub economy class floor seating lots of room for activities that is the enterprise b whaddya mean  that is not a dreamliner yes it is its got those big magic windows that can fade to black with a press of a button yep just a mock up  that is one of those early build 787 for sale no it is a demonstrator mock up the teens have long since been sold  nope she is apparently a bbj  seems to be the case my mistake still would love to id which one it is there is a few candidates it seems  perfect as the next air amp space museum  i think this picture has reposted on reddit since reddit was a thing  what are all those grates for under the windows  hvac damn you could make that into a crazy private jet where are the seat rails  so cool and spacious looking where the seats at  not installed yet seats are usually installed when the plane reaches its customer  i wonder how many pigeons i can fit in there this is flaired as discussion so what are we discussing how this is a low quality repost of a repost  and still not wide enough of a 3 3 3 layout i love that legroom if spirit ever gets one of these they will implement standing room only  so much room for activities  i whistleblew sales fraud at former company a strawman anonymous salesforce user login was backdating sales contracts to put them into earlier months quarters years a week later two week sinto february i was told you have to fulfill your q1 quota by the end of february instead of march like every other sales person in the company or you are fired 2 weeks later i was fired for cause and told me they hired a law firm to investigate my allegations two lawyers call me up we are investigating oh this is being recorded why were you looking at those sales contracts because they were my sales you fucktards on24 they were privately held at the time amp trying get the books looking good to go public  on24 is pure garbage  hello preacher thanks from the choir loft you did not sue them for this  this is the first i am hearing of the possibility it is not like boeing self reported this issue years ago it is a sensational conspiracy and cover up sarcasm boeing whistleblower did not kill himself no no this is a different whistleblower who has not killed himself yet  yet  wait for iiiit yet  neither did epstein neither did kurt cobain neither did john mcafee the politically correct term is has not been suicided    your evidence senior people at boeing make a lot of money he was complaining about boeing very well throw them all in jail  he was testifying in an appeal for a defamation case that he lost he blew the whistle years before his family said he was not doing well and believes it was suicide   gt the whistleblower complaint said he pointed out to management the existence of drilling issues with the 787 and was then ignored and ultimately transferred out of the 787 program to the 777 program  gt in his new role salehpour said he discovered subpar work with aligning body pieces and pressure on engineers to green light work they have not yet inspected gt in all salehpour said the issues involve more than 400 777s and 1 000 787s that is crazy they moved him to entire new production because he brought to attention some issues   gt that is crazy they moved him to entire new production because he brought to attention some issues previous whistle blowers have stated boeing made a list of inspectors based on how many faults they reported the top 50 reporters on the list were 1 first moved programs 2 then moved to night shift 3 then targeted for firing so the claim here is consistent with previously alleged boeing behavior  fucking crazy moving programs can be devastating work 737 in renton and live in pierce county guess what you are 777 now and work in snohomish county best of luck on you commute through seattle twice a day  step 4 murdered  we have given you enough chances  and then proceeded to find even more issues with his new project  he is doing what he is paid to do he is got a spine he is brave last one said if anything happens it is not suicide i hope this one will not end up like the previous one  do you have a source on the guy saying if anything happens it was not suicide  you should be able to google a number of hits he said it to a friend shortly before he died  you go  newsweek is unable to independently verify the claim made by the reported family friend in the interview  how could they possibly verify he did not go to a notary or something he told her if she was a witness you had to determine if she is credible  how dare he inspect how dare he inspect  good guy boeing moving its whistleblowers to various programs to ensure the issues they reported are not made elsewhere in the company  moving programs usually results in an employee quitting especially when your 30 minute commute turns into 3 4 hours each way  well the vatican does the same thing so it must be okay s works for the catholic church   ignored and ultimately transferred could mean anything if he did not raise the issue through official channels then yes being ignored is the likely consequence just pointing it out to management is not enough if you do not follow the company mandated safety process and being transferred happens all the time there is not necessarily a causal link between the two for people who have not worked in the industry please just keep an open mind with this stuff engineers can be as dumb narrow minded and just plain wrong as anybody else i should know i am one  yeah like did he make any etac events update cds follow up on any ncs an email to your boss is not the right way those guys are just politicians  and that the new production line they sent him to was just as fucked up as the first  they moved him so he would help find other areas of concern and bring them up s should have looked into what happened to the man who blew the whistle on the the alaska airlines md 80 jackscrew issue blackballed and got dollar0 for his troubles if you are going to be a whistleblower do it because you think it is the right thing to do and knowing that you will never work in the industry again  yeah its also mentally very hard propably also affects their direct family have a lot of respect for them  it is gotta be very difficult you are likely to lose the majority of your work relationships people who were formerly your friends get spooked that any association with you will cause management to view them negatively they worry you will drag them into things as a witness or even giving them the benefit of the doubt many times when you no longer work with people you just naturally drift apart the loss of income causes stress in the marriage family and even non work friends may start to distance themselves from you if you predictably start talking a lot about your lawsuit and the negative consequences you suffer it is a long hard road and not for the weary  oh yeah you might maybe get paid out in a few years but you will never work major aerospace again maybe shit tier perpetually going out of business supplier but not 1st tier boeing will find out you work there and you will be fired  the 787 entered service 12 5 years ago outside of the initial lithium battery issue there have been no major issues with the airframe i am not saying that there are not possible issues it is certainly nothing that should cause any major concern especially for passengers  ahhh there is the tune of 30 frames still sitting in storage somewhere that need major rework before they can fly planes that have never been delivered this started 2 years ago this was assembly and production error not fundamental design   gt 30 frames still sitting in storage that is a lot of 787 airframes covid and people not flying went on for a really long time they were and are in storage because of defects making them undeliverable  which line numbers  you can find all the line numbers here along with the customers  no i was asking which ones you are mentioning because there have been many undelivered for many reasons over the decade 10 22 some with the tiger stripe issue some for rework needed on the joins it happens by the way 10 22 which should have been scrapped after sitting for a long long time were either sold at bargain prices over given to customers for appeasement over late deliveries groundings and of course to replace airplanes that boeing hid a software bomb inside  10 22 the teenagers should all be scrapped but they are out there mostly with ethiopian  it is not the teens air india too the first ever 787 8 vt ani from charleston does not feel safe to me i am not sure that follows for a flaw that is claimed to be dangerous only after fatigue builds up but even design flaws sometimes take years to cause incidents so regulators can not assume an old design is automatically safe it was 7 years before md 11s started flipping over for example  there is been over 1 000 787s built compared to only 200 md 11s 5 times as many planes flying for almost twice as long does not really sound like a reasonable comparison  until the airframes fail because the drilling issues become a metal fatigue issue that is why c and d checks exist at 12 5 years the oldest frames will have been through d checks and the vast majority of them through at least 1 c check if not multiple  but dreamliner is not quite metal  correct it is actually easier to find bad composite with ultrasound than it is the find aluminum cracks with eddy current takes a bit of time but that is why d checks are a thing  that is still a failure of engineering process though and not just in aviation installation checks are did we do it right and rectify subsequent checks such as light or deep maintenance or in this case c and d are to make sure that it is holding up as per design or assumed degradation rate saying it is ok c and d checks will pick it up is poor practice and should not be relied upon in isolation and is just a swiss cheese incident waiting to happen  kinda like that whole fiasco about not allowing a pilot to get back into a cockpit when locked from the inside right  let me tell you about the first 100 shipsets of warped composite floor beams we had lasers out measuring at one point to confirm it because the titanium seat tracks didnt fit the part belonged to alenia for both engineering and procurement they subbed it out to another company that had iai make them in isreal they were not straight but we had 100 sets already made so we installed them best we could engineering said not a safety of flight issue and to replace at d check  they have tested an actual airframe with 165k simulated flight cycles to determine if there are actual structural issues that is to an airframe made prior to manufacturing improvements in 2021 the seattle times article actually provides details on this problem i do not think the plan is just to randomly fly planes and see how long they last   i helped build the fatigue airframe it is the old unimproved 8 variant  you still have a b checks between and they do find issues sometimes that result in an aircraft moving to heavy check i think currently most 787s are fine they have been around quite a while and there is no guarantees that an airlines maintenance program will be better than boeings assembly line  i think you are missing the point we should not be relying on the various mid life maintenance inspections to pick up basic design and construction failures  there is no indication that the 787 has massive structural issues based on their age despite the allegations also all aircraft have basic design and construction failures these issues are not exclusive to boeing aircraft have ad is and other campaigns used to address these issues as they become known airbus with thales avionics ddrmi need checked due to problems that result in failure and erjs aft cargo doors have issues staying closed which need checked ads are released and are active for both airframes to address those issues it happens i have personally corrected many varying issues found on different aircraft manufactured by boeing and other companies point being as long as people design and build aircraft there will be design and construction failures like this regardless of who makes the aircraft sometimes it takes one or more instances of failure to discover the problems  ok again you are missing the point  am i most of these posts and the comments on them are driven by unfounded conspiracies surrounding whistleblower john barnett is death i will wait until the investigation is complete before claiming ignorantly there is an issue with boeing quality especially when it is unsupported based on statistical data on reliability and safety every time a tire goes flat on a boeing aircraft these days there are 1 000 social media posts about how awful boeing aircraft are which is dumb in these posts people comment presuming issues that may not even exist  i knew john loooong ago during my 787 days did not know him well but i am not surprised if his life being completely ruined and the long drawn out stress of court proceedings made him take his own life i have nearly done the same going through similar  you do not live in the real world  is this wrong  yes  is it going to break in service  unlikely  if it does will it be a safety of flight issue  no  ship it put a note in the maintenance book  safety should be 1 but remember there is a lot of logistics and business making happening involved the trick is to beat up business daddy take his lunch money and do it right without going out of business or nationalize boeing  off topic but your comment made me learn about the existence name of these checks thank you i always like to learn more about aviation  they have very little metal on them most of the structure of the 787 is cfrp composites can still fatigue and the fatigue behaviour of them is far more variable and less understood than in metals that is mainly because there is such a large variety of what composite materials lay up the resin matrix curing are all things which can vary and each combination could have its own fatigue behaviour there are also more failure modes in a composite delaminating resin failure fibre breakage debonding of the fibre and matrix etc  i know that that is why i pointed it out composites that were drilled wrong is far more concerning from a fatigue life perspective than metals due to their catastrophic rather than gradual failure modes  they are composite though there have been problems even a few major ones missing countersinks swage fasteners 3 to 4 grips too long an issue with the 47 section called tiger striping shims lots of shim issues mostly all fixed before delivery or deferred to c or d check  well hello mr boeing glad everywhere i need to go i can get to on an airbus reading this article while sitting in a dreamliner that is taking off  jokes aside i would like to think that any major flaws with the dreamliner would be identified early on considering this plane has been up in the air for more than 10 years and that is despite the shitshow that boeing is  787 is pretty much the safest plane there is i am not sure why you are down voted in terms of passenger miles it is the safest aircraft ever at the moment  for real most people think the whole 737 max saga as well as maintenance issues means all planes by boeing are dangerous when maintenance issues are the responsibility of the airline  downvoted because grrr boeing bad etc people are conflating the quality of the design and the quality of the manufacturing the 787 design is proven to be safe but the known manufacturing problems of the last few years and all of boeing is other problems does raise questions better than the a350 that machine carried passengers through a crash while being engulfed in flames  i think the point is that the 787 has not had any crashes even if that accident was not the fault of the 350 it still counts as an accident i do not agree if anything it demonstrated how resilient and safe the a350 actually is it is a feat of strength not saying that this makes the 787 less safe i think it is a great plane for passengers  flaws everywhere in the hardware just imagine the software close your eyes boys and girls nothing to see here  haha oh man at my old airline it was a general rule never to turn them completely off if you did you had a near 100percent chance of timing out of duty hours and needing a new crew out came all the software gremlins that aside they were sick  at my current airline it is the complete opposite we had a tech read to remind everyone that they need shutting down every x amount of days to stop issues arrising i forget the exact amount though i work base maintenance on a different airframe but we all get the same reads regardless  reboot interval for 787s used to be 51 days and the ad is probably still active to avoid issues from stale data piling up and causing trouble  it has been around 5 years since i last saw one so it is probably changed now  meanwhile the 787 has to be rebooted every 51 days or somehow it starts feeding stale data to the displays i have no idea how their software is architected but as a developer it seems absolutely insane that they need a system to filter out stale data from the live flight displays why the hell is stale data being actively processed in the first place is something replaying logged data on whatever com bus the displays use it frankly seems like a systems design failure  technically the 787 is the safest plane ever just saying  would not that be the a380 not to mention this stat means next to nothing considering how new this plane still is  the 787 has far more passenger miles than the a380  the a380 had cracks in its wings and a flaw in its rolls royce engines qf32 so yeah it happens everywhere  flying is the safest way to travel we have never left one up there yet  do you mean statistically  yes lol my bad eli5  no hull losses is what he means  no incidents there was a battery issue but it still never led to any incidents  it is only 12 years old no incidents  should have opened an investigation after a bunch of people that build them said they would not fly on them besides that one dude who said he is a thrill seeker  are you sure you are not confusing the 787 with the 737max  no the video said they were working on the 787 i just watched it again last night i remember feeling shocked because the 787 is one of my favourite aircraft  ah fair my bad  no problem tbf now i read back my reply could have been worded a little nicer  gt should have opened an investigation after a bunch of people that build them said they would not fly on them well those people were clearly proven wrong considering after about 13 years and 40 million flight hours without any major accident the 787 statistically is the safest aircraft ever built  if you ask any engineer every aircraft is flawed  engineer with a aircraft company here yes but no mostly no they all have their flaws but the engineers for the 787 say there are some pretty major ones there is a big difference in having flaws and being flawed i know it semantics but i think it makes a big difference  i think the biggest issue here is the safety culture like even if these defects issues that this engineer inspected turned out to be nothing major he was pretty much ignored and transferred for doing his job properly if boeing is encouraging this type of culture and only rewarding hiring engineers that overlook issues it will manifest massively in the future to something super critical  they have been flying for a decade now and the only issue has been with battery fires how major can a flaw be if it never manifests the article says his issue was with body panel alignment you can get pretty sloppy with that and it will still function fine  the problem is when factory shennigans differ so much from the design spec that longevity assumptions go out the window looks like the 787 does not need a d check until 12 years so the oldest ones should be up for them in the next couple years i guess we will find out soon whether there is anything to this  it is not just time that will get it in d check it is airframe hours  even then most airframes will not encounter the boundaries of the design envelope wrt gust loads maneuver loads hard landing loads etc  i pray no crashes before the checks that is why boeing pays so much for lawyers  what a silly question they have an alleged design life of five decades 40k flights they are still young these allegations are serious the us senate is going to hold hearings next week the 787  165k cycles versus the design life of 44k cycles per i would take everything with a grain of salt boeing halted deliveries in 2020 2022 over this issue which was and still is under a microscope from the faa  and boeing is lobyists will water anything down     gt engineers do this often and usually to people who do not really care and just need their signature that is kind of a problem though the people who do not care and just need a signature are the type of people like the ones that forgot to put in screws because they found a procedural workaround to not need a signature  if i have to approve some modification that was no tested or expected i will not put my name on it this literally the definition of cutting corners classic scumbag defense  well i am a maintenance engineer as opposed to design and not on any boeing aircraft so i am not sure your angle there friend  what is your angle in rushing into the comment section to say that every aircraft is flawed without addressing any of the issues the whistleblower claimed seems like you have an interest in minimizing the whistleblower is claims  mate i do not even have the energy for this you need educating by not by me hope you succeed in life whatever you are doing  this person is a hero that should be celebrated instead of treated like shit  wonder how long until this one has a convenient accident  an inconvenient run in with a gun he tripped and fell over it and nobody saw nothing at alaska we were questioned why we found significan not problems during a checks we were told not to look at certain areas afterwards then flight 261 happened  i am wary of boeing but the 787 seems solid there was the battery issue but there is been 0 fatalities and 0 hull losses in its 13 years of flying  the 787 was grounded for over a year because of a shimming problem in the fuselage joins never caused an incident  deliveries were stopped for over a year and there were only a couple of airframes in service that were grounded for the issue to be fixed all of the 787s that were already in service continued flying and would get fixed at a scheduled maintenance check airplanes are buckets of bolts strung together with engineering and production hope and a good pilot sadly the amount of incompetence is growing in the country and boeing is just a visible example of a much larger problem at hand  acute care hospitals are getting worse than boeing strap in gonna be a long ride  listen just cuz some planes are falling apart does not mean anything is wrong  did not 787 production cease in everett in 2021 would not it make sense that he was reassigned to 777 also being transferred from program to program really does not seem like an abnormal thing for a company as big as boeing that manufactures different models all under one roof in everett btw i get that jumping up and down on parts to make them fit is a funny and maybe shocking visual to some but let is remember we are talking about 10 000 solid one piece cfrp barrel sections here you could drop an f150 on these sections and doubtful they deflect more than a 1 1 000th of an inch in reality the engineering defined pull up allowance is probably beyond the force anyone jumping up and down is doing imo  the front has not fallen off of one yet  do not see the issue really they have been in service for almost 13 years already and if the issues are only about shortened life span than surely any structural damage to the fuselage will pop up in one of the many maintenance checks over the decades and not just suddenly and unexpectedly happen from one day to the other i mean other aircraft like the a380 also have issues with cracks but they fortunately are identified before causing any trouble  i guess the main issue is where is the gaps that were not joined properly what are the stresses at the point and are they inspected and how often if they are that will determine a lot regarding the danger here all aircraft get fatigue cracks and parts rub and wear against each other you just hope the aircraft is inspected at the right time to identify these issues and put corrective actions in place   salehpour is attorneys said the faa was surprised to discover through his complaint that the gaps were still an issue so faa is pretty much investigating itself at this point  the faa are in fact boeing employees  did the faa only just listen to all the whistleblowers that went to al jazeera or do they only care now that boeing is getting a track record and the whistleblowers are now being seen as probably correct it is taken way too many years for the faa to give a shit  gee i have a flight on a 787 this weekend  me too eddm to cyyz  hope he does not end up dead like the last whistleblower  break out the bull shirt repellent i thought there was a comment on here from an engineer on the 787 program several years ago basically saying he would never fly on one edit   rip whistleblower i can not believe they were suicidal and decided to end their life right after calling out boeing  oh shit maybe we should keep an eye on this one considering what happened to the last whistleblower  would not it be time to bring in some outside help and not leave it up to the faa alone people keep pointing the finger at boeing but the fact that things are slipping through the cracks does not exactly put confidence in the faa boeing would love to supply consultants to help  when i worked at sikorsky is in the 1980s i got transferred to the second shift for working too fast as a technical writer if you were young and ambitious their goal was to slow you down make you old fast  sounds like i should listen to if it is boeing i am not flying   going great i am on one for 11 hours on friday dude needs witness protection asap i hope he lasts longer than the last wistleblower who committed suicide  so about a decade  i wonder how he is gonna commit suicide i wonder if the insurers are going to make it more expensive to operate boeing fleets  i have worked with several ex boeing employees and this jives with what i have heard about the 787 line  the whistlerblower then was black bagged and is expected to take his own life in what is now know as the boeing suicide where in they take you to a hotel and fake your death and leave you dead in your car and everyone just kinda accepts it is not a hitjob by an angry corporate culture that has military connections  oh no another preventable suicide he just entered the top ten of the 2024 deadpool  that whistleblower better start avoiding hotel balconies how longs this one last whether or not the defect is cause for concern of repairs does not matter this is just another example of a toxic safety culture at boeing that i see a lot in the company i work at this one may not kill anyone but eventually one will y all forget about mcas so soon  is this an attempt at suicide by whistleblowing  there is another angle at looking at all this boeing trashing who wins from it all  there is a new player in town comac the new chinese alternative  comac will never get approval to fly in the us  gt there is another angle at looking at all this boeing trashing who wins from it all  maybe people who do not die from future airplane crashes  juming up and down to bend and align parts boing boing at boeing  people should know whistleblowers can have a substantial monetary incentive to do this stuff i take this stuff with a grain of salt until the whole story comes out of course no one likes to wait for that and people generally just lose their minds after reading a headline how so i would say they have higher chances of being fired blacklisted in their field and then bankrupted by lawfare from their employer    they may but if the company gets fined dollar10 000 000 and you get 20percent as a whistle blower that is a decent amount of cash most people who are whistleblowers generally are not in the good graces of their company and on their way out anyways this is especially true for companies that are in the media a lot the government will want to make an example of them because everyone in washington works more on emotion than logic and facts about the attorneys they will generally work on contingent basis and will get 20percent of the cash which still leaves the whistleblower with a decent amount of money this is all similar to how people who get axed from their employee claim a hostile work environment on their way out and try to go on short term disability and sue the company because why not  financial incentive to commit suicide  if it is boeing i am not going excellent news days before i get on a 787  for a flawed aircraft they have a very good safety record beyond the early battery problems they seem to be doing well  that is good i would hate for them to have to change the saying to if it is boeing ai not none of y all going  put some guards around this guy we do not want to find him dead another boeing engineer will be committing suicide soon  boeing shills all up in this thread damn that is pretty quaint with those retro style control columns  rode one to hnl today what a nice airplane i am a 777 captain and i can not wait to get into the 78  if i am going to be honest i like the 777 more i guess it is preference but the fact that it is so long and massive is beautiful to me  from a pilots perspective the 787 all day sure the 777 has a bit more excess grunt but as a machine to operate the flight deck environment and the air quality christ the air quality there is just no comparison  absolutely i 100percent agree if i had to choose though i would choose the 777 to fly simply because i just find it more majestic the 787 is better for pax and pilots comfort though  787 all day but i have the 747 in the logbook for majestic there is no beating that unless they bring back the concorde  100percent beautiful flight deck i do not care much what is behind me anymore heck if i could be home and the pay was right i would be flying king airs serious though the 777 is great and beautiful and the best boeing i have flown that being said i know the 787 is even better boeing just keeps fixing things us pilots did not even know needed fixing ha also that extra pressurization and air quality goes a long long way when you have to be in a metal tube at 37 000 feet for 14 hours  just wait for the x uohohohoho is he resting his shoe on the screen do boeing pilots not even have foot stirrups  no phone holder either  no phone holder on the bus either  little pads in front of instrument panel for feet but yea everybody is missing a table proper feet placements there is a reason why they say that the bus is a better office y all with the tables and footrests are spoiled  all that an no backup camera  no heated seats either  talk about blind spots too that is got to be fake i did not see the chemtrails switch  so in newer aircraft chemtrail activation is automated now call me old school but i think it sucks soon gone are the days where an aviator could find the joy in flipping that switch smiling as he looks down knowing every frog underneath his flight path will soon be gay  i sure do miss a good ole analog chemtrail switch  it is also part of a subscription payment model now too  they pull out the switch when the camera is gone in modern aircraft they are more cleverly hidden and integrated in the cockpit so as not to be noticed so easily if you do not know where to look quite effective and works as you were not able to spot it  where the adf still has one actually 8 and 9 you can select one through the nav rad page but they saw sense by the 10 and binned the adf  is it actual adf or gps overlay  actual adf you can allegedly listen to the sports scores on the ident allegedly  that is hilarious i remember doing that in a piper archer 15 years ago did not expect it in a plane like that nice to hear that some modern planes still use the good ol adf ndb technology especially considering it is a big passenger jet designed to land at big airports with vor and ils  nobody uses vor anymore adf is only used for am radio lmao good riddance why are there four stripes in the right seat i wonder captain oe perhaps  layman is question why plane makers still put in the throttle stick for the engines just tradition or is there another use for having an actual stick instead of a smaller handle or even a guage on the control column  being able to easily and quickly adjust power is crucial to flying any plane by hand pilots should always have the ability to adjust the thrust produced by each engine without having to look at the position in the same way you would not want a car with a dial instead of a gas pedal a pilot wants to be able to hand fly the plane with control over thrust pitch roll and yaw being easily accessible without needing to look at any of the input locations furthermore thrust levers give an appropriate level of granularity that is less easily achieved using something like a small stick or dial this allows small adjustments to the airspeed without needing to look at the throttle control or think about where you are positioning it you can adjust by the feedback you feel from the plane and or your indicated air speed depending on situation thanks for explanation appreciate it and i understand  so boeing no longer uses the beige color for the instrument panel  good old beaver brown  i fly both the 777 and the 787 and i like them both very much the 787 has lots of nice bells and whistles that are missing on the 777 not to mention lower cabin altitude and fresher air but if i had to choose one the triple wins in my books i prefer a cdu with real buttons real window shades that can be rolled in and out quickly and a larger crew rest more tactile buttons and less messing around with a mouse that jumps all over the place especially when it is turbulent newer is not always better  pardon what does this mouse manage can not wait for the episode of mayday where a horrific crash was caused by a jittery mouse in turbulence he has a point right a mouse should not be something that jumps about in turbulence  i wanted more explanation on what this mouse does because yes that makes 0 sense there is a trackpad to control the cursor on the cdu etc even though you can buy a perfectly good one cheaply for your laptop these make the cursor jump around even in still air you are required to use it a lot on the 787 because the cdu has no physical buttons  so as a pilot does not the lack of physical buttons introduce some level of risk that could be avoided especially during turbulence or am i incorrect  yes putting a trackpad in that is often difficult to control and using it for so many basic functions was a solution looking for a problem the original design called for touchscreens but this was not certified by the faa even touchscreens would have been a step back from physical buttons even car manufacturers have figured out that touchscreens in a vehicle are a bad idea and are going back to real buttons and switches  all beautiful except the touchscreen fms i feel like it would be a pain it is not touchscreen you use a trackpad small humps by the thrust levers to manipulate the fms still should have kept physical buttons though  ah i see i stand corrected i do not think you were wrong to begin with trackpads are still a pain compared to real buttons   gt t is not touchscreen weird considering every other fms since the 737 has been touchscreen or at least the guys i fly with think so  must be the same guys who think the mfd is a touchscreen too  only the 777x has touchscreens  737 max 10 as well it looks truly awful compared to the physical cdu it replaced  yikes i would much rather have real buttons  would you look at that all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order i have checked 1 697 611 360 comments and only 321 260 of them were in alphabetical order  that does not seem to be true  good bot i still do not see a freakin cupholder  they are there  15 17 18 20 degree flap selections what gives  all the different flap settings are for t o performance for slowing down and landing you just use the traditional 1 5 15 20 25 30  cries in 767 pilot is there going to be a time when everyone converts to a side stick vs yoke  some pilots prefer to fly the plane rather than to make a suggestion to the computer  i do not believe that is happening and there is no reason for everyone to shift to either i just see side stick more and more in ga and noticed on some heavy is so i was wondering if some one with inside knowledge knew if it was a thing  sully thinks air france 447 would not have happened with yokes junior officer stalled the plane without anyone noticing until it was too late  wow did not know i am not advocating for one or the other just to be clear i was just at an airshow and noticed lancair cirrus and a few others all have the side stick i was just curious is all aviation was transferring to that for some reason however i believe you or sully answered that for me  yeah he was interviewed as part of a tv documentary the pitot tubes were delivering erroneous speeds and the young officer in the right seat kept pulling the nose up while everyone in the cockpit was trying to figure out what was going on per the cvr his error was discovered but too late  confusion in the middle of the night over the atlantic with the senior pilot in a rest period gt disastrous cockpit management  still a yoke though just why  since when did yokes become a bad thing  since side sticks became a thing  airbus has used side sticks boeing has alexis used yokes boeing and airbus are the largest commercial aviation giants ever i know i have flown both and i am a smart ass stating my preference  as a non pilot but someone who does have to work with their hands doctor i am curious as to how muscle memory works with side sticks for years you train and learn to fly by the right hand and then you get promoted and fly with the left does that ever cause any problems in critical situations where you may need to disconnect auto pilot in surgery we often practice skills ambidextrously from the beginning however there is clearly a side predominance to the right hand in most surgeries the lead surgeon stands on the patient is right side most surgical instruments are right handed we flip to the left side because of the patient is position or left hand if it has better access ergonomics than the right for a certain step so a professor may be teaching a resident how to operate from the patient is left side think of this like a check captain however when they need to take over it is not like they just say my airplane they will call a switch and physically switch sides with the other person i am wondering if a yoke is better because while the sight lines are different the hand dominance is the same you also primarily use the right hand for the yoke in the right seat and left hand on the yoke in the left seat just like the sidestick  exactly outside hand for flight controls inside hand for thrust levers it takes a couple of hours to adjust but then you are fine  i like yoke like this because it offers nice tactile feedback about what the pf is doing i know airbus has a cursor on the pfd but i feel tactile is best airbus sticks are not digitally linked there is a sidenote to this planes like the g600 amp mc21 have sidesticks but unlike airbus they are digitally linked active sidesticks if you wiggle the captain is sidestick on mc21 the fo sidestick also wiggles excellent tactile feedback specially during an emergency   i have flown both yoke is better every time almost everyone who is used both prefer side stick  nice foot on the avionics  are there redundant analog systems or is it 100percent digital  what do you think  i do not know that is why i asked  watching lots of youtube videos has shown me that most of those buttons are for entering flight plans or changing the radio frequency what airline is this  nice try faa haha no lol plus it would technically be caa as i am from the united kingdom i am an aspiring aeronautical engineer not caa person  i think lufthansa if you look at the far right display on the top right corner seems to be a german registration tail d xxxx and the flight number is something like dlh7tx as far as i can tell yeah we know beautiful nice haha i am not the biggest fan because i do not like that many screens miss that office had a great four years there i am on the queen of the skies now a bucket list item but the 787 was a fun job  is it as plastic as it looks  where are the cup holders  pause the video at around 8s and look to the left corner behind the captain seat  fate is the hunter  it legit looks like a too rounded and tidy can not be real fake cockpit from a near future sci fi movie  but it is reaaaal  what if i have 10 ankles  for sure arnold is calves are not getting through that gap  i love hate watching this video the 787 is the most beautiful aircraft to me it is the one i would chose to fly if i could but holy mother of fuck the commitment and expenses for the training and education are damn near astronomical i have got too good of a gig now to throw it away i love the  i have seen the control panels but never the whole shot of the flight cabin that shit is spacious holy shit  sweet setup msflightsim setup my buddies garage  i will be flying on one of these for the first time on british airways dxb to lhr really excited the a380 is by far the most comfortable plane i have been on i hate turbulence and on the a380 you do not feel it much at all i assume the 787 will also handle turbulence well given the flex of its wings  you barely feel turbulence unless it is pretty moderate the 787 handles it really well  hey i know what some of those buttons do  i definitely know at least 2 of them maybe 4  i thought at first it was a scifi hotel room  the faa does not want you to know this but the 787s at the airport are free you can take them home i myself have 30 787s in my backyard  pilots got the best seat in the plane  so beautiful  sadly for me fancy and all but still a prime example for design before function and just because i could does not mean i should if i look at the speed of this seat motor and the additional weight of the motor additional power supply etc i do not see any benefit you need a mechanical backup unlatch anyway and i still prefer my basic mechanical j rail  a common injury amongst older pilots is tweaking a knee as they climb over the center console with one leg then twist and try to plop down into their seat the slow running motor is to make sure anything around the seat can be moved and will not be crushed jammed  are you saying they should get rid of electric seat adjustments electric seat adjustment is really really handy as you can move the seat during any maneuver inflight such as climbout where you have significan not lateral forces that would prevent you from moving the seat forward plus all the crap that gets built up on the drive gear and rail  the number of pilots killed because the motor driven seat slipped back compared to the number because the mechanical latch slipped is  has one of these craft had any serious issues  lithium batteries caught fire on the initial production units  not that i am aware of boeing is big oopsy whoopsy was the 737 max upgrade where they self certified a change to the avionics and autopilot that resulted in several crashes  it is a flight deck ngl electric motorized seats are dumb i know it is a good plane and i have heard enough pilots talk about how much they love the cockpit and the systems but for me it all looks like a bunch of cheap fisherprice plastic a350 cockpit looks better aesthetically imo  that is just pure biased hate towards boeing can not tell if you are joking or not but i am a boeing guy myself been on more 747 767 777 and 737s than i can count and the 747 will always be my favourite aircraft i am american too so i do not even have much experience with airbus does not change the fact that the 787 cockpit looks like cheap plastic and you will note the 787 cockpit looks nothing like any other boeing cockpit i mean look at the chairs and nothing else they look like something that got pulled from an old star trek set there is nothing elegant about that cockpit except the windows and natural light and all the classic boeing aesthetics were removed it is horrendous  ok but can it run pong  u repostsleuthbot repost man i want to travel in one some day  where is the cup holder  triple is better with the beige color  i thought it was gonna pull a barrel roll a tex johnson move he wound it turned around and unwound it to sell airplanes  this is a nebraska johnson move maybe ohio  beat me to it pic would be crucified for doing that today  a late client of mine was the radio engineer on board the dash 80 during that stunt everyone including me was hanging in our harnesses upside down and looking forward to the cockpit wondering what was going through tex is head as we went through the maneuvers  it was a perfect 1g roll nobody was hanging google bob hoover pouring iced tea   i have always sold airplanes by demonstrating them and i knew the audience was the iata airline executives and all the leading engineers and scientists said johnston it was not a risk and i would never do anything to risk myself or the company is equipment  all right snapped allen you know that now we know that just do not do it anymore  and that was not the actual convo between mr allen and tex in an interview tex detailed when he was called to his office and spoke with mr allen he was asked about his family how they were doing and advised not to do that again no snapping or anger because mr allen knew he had a crapton of sales and commitments pouring in as a result of tex is stunt  this was from a seattle pi article it is legit    have you read his autobiography the pi article  his words i did not embellish  so tex was recently exonerated from his high altitude experiment which came within 20 feet of fatal catastrophe  sky king would have definitely done a barrel roll rip  bank angle  not gonna lie i was really worried for a second it would be like that b 52 video from the 90s so relieved when it stabilized also that is some sick livery  i would say the maneuverability of a 787 is just a wee bit better than a b 52 the maneuverability of most geological features is better than a b 52 they are going faster and have better energy management plus the maneuver has been practiced before the show the b 52 crash happened from a pilot who kept pushing the limits and was trying to show off got way too slow at a low altitude and could not recover  it was his last flight too his whole family was on the flight line watching massive tragedy he was one of the pilots but not the one known for pushing the limits and hot dogging the one who is family was there was flying because everyone else refused  i always heard it told the other way xos last flight who was the one known for hotdogging and who jos did not want to fly with so his family was there with him and everything  nope lt col bud holland was the hot dogger and it was the fini flight for the vice wing commander col rob wolff who is family was there to celebrate his final flight in the af bud is family was possibly there too but it was not supposed to be his fini  dang did not know that thanks what b52 video    i googled and found but thanks   i googled it but thanks it is basically a wrap livery that was testing out technology super cool up close  was indeed certainly added some nice color to the a stalls when it was at bfi proper big stab helps against dutch roll i hope the tray tables were in the stowed position and the seat belt lights were on  stowed and locked position  she is built like a steakhouse but she handles like a bistro r unexpectedfuturama will not these things pretty much do a completely vertical climb when empty  empty weight is 250 300k lbs thrust is 70 76k lbf per side so no they can not come anywhere near vertical without bleeding energy but if you put the camera ship in the right place you can make it look like it can  while its steep its usually 45deg max takeoff pitch at the airshow very cool tho most comm flights are 15 max  md 80 has entered the chat empty weight 284000 lb engine thrust 71000 lbf x 2 142000lb thrust is not greater than weight therefore no vertical   it does not need to sustain vertical for it to look cool  yes but that would be posted in r ohshitohshitoshit got me interesting how its thrust is equal to exactly half its weight yep when empty that is fairly common and fully loaded is usually about a third holds true for a surprising amount of planes  there is this retired old ba air france ship that had just shy of 160 000lb thrust and 178 000lb empty weight might have been an interesting air show bird  still a thrust weight ratio of almost 0 5 is extremely impressive  whilst the video is cool can someone explain what is special about it simply how steep it is banking  um yeah that bank angle is insane  i am just imagining the bank angle bank angle warnings blaring while the pilot is got a big smile on bank angle sexy afffff makes sense that is something you would expect out of a fighter jet not a giant commercial airliner  if you were in the cockpit you would be impressed  and if you were a passenger you would be shitting your pants  only air france flies passengers in air shows  i am wondering too although i am sure 90 degree banking is not in the owner is manual  awesome i saw the 777x pull the same bank when i was at das2021 could not stop smiling when it did that  impressive steep climb to hard left bank creating the potential for accelerated stall while low and slow but plane and pilot execute it perfectly  did not even really lose altitude when he flattened it out on top either really impressive maneuver for such a huge airplane  bank angle bank angle really gonna turn some heads when you also paint the wings no one does that  serious question i realise the plane makers are showing off to the public and trying to woo potential buyers but i have never understood how aerobatics help sell a commercial plane anyone  shows how safe and capable it is  thanks for answering military planes i get but just does not seem that relevant for commercial planes they would have passengers freight and more fuel on board would those manoeuvres still be viable under those circumstances and if not then why bother  in a lot of cases maneuvers like that can still be performed depends on a lot of factors with the plane loaded if it absolutely has to same logic applies as to why aircraft manufacturers apply more load to the wings during testing than the aircraft would ever conceivably face during normal operations they need to make sure that it is capable of performing and enduring the most extreme stunts just in case it has to  great answer thanks  sure thing  well when i am sitting in turbulence and i think about videos like this that i have watched i am much less nervous in the old days i was a wreck  it does seem relevant when you think of the planes that could not pull off these trucks look at the tu 144 and what happened at the paris air show basically killed it commercially   aeronautics here is a loose term lol  approved for chandelles lazy 8 not to exceed 60 degrees angle of bank def not in the company manual after i washed out of military pilot training i went on to finish my cpl civvy commercial my ego was real bruised from the wash out but my instructor was the most awesome chill dude and it was the first time i ever flew with a real sense of working together and teaching each other so we discussed it and worked through a few textbook lazy 8 in the old c 172 which he owned pilots often talk about design limits being that there is regulatory limits and company limits it was a good moment to sooth my broken ego just a little bit at the time  so  he turned left  he was not an ambi turner well until now    this guy knows some maneuvers not every plane is built to withstand the forces behind these types of movements passenger planes have a maximum angle they can bank before the plane is at risk of deteriorating from such a harsh movement usually maxing out at 45 degrees if i remember correctly obviously this varies a bit between models so yeah if this was like most other planes we would be watching this pilots last moments instead  you should read the comments and learn why this is a crazy move for a plane like this  believe it or not when i posted my comment there were all of two other comments in this thread and i read them both  winning move it is not a contest well at least in our common definition of the word  do you make this complaint every time you hear about someone is winning smile   bank angle  nothing will ever beat the 707 barrel roll the pilot got screamed at by boeing when he landed like what are you doing and his response selling airplanes this actually happened  look how the wings flex wow i can hear the female voice in the cabin bank angle bank angle i think i had too many aviation videos on youtube  60 years ago barrel roll now left turn looks like a fucking whale and i love it  people often forget that when empty these things have a bucketload of additional thrust to weight ratio when are they gonna let test pilots 1g roll airliners again  i kind of want to know what it feels like to be sitting in the rear most bathroom while they perform this move lol weeeeeee  pshhh that is nothing 747 is used to barrel roll during air shows  lol ok  it was a 707 the 747 only did it in trials in seattle still pretty cool though  if i am remembering my aviation history correct and i may be wrong the usaf were auditioning for the next generation refuelers it was the b 707 vs the dc 8 tex johnson was the boeing pilot doing the flyby and decided to do the barrel roll in front of the assembled crowd the af people loved it and boeing got the contract and we still have modified b 707 is 50 years later in the form of e 3 is kc 135 is and jstars  no the 747 did not maybe in a sim but it did not happen irl    when flying yesterday i think the pilot did a turn pretty close that honestly banked like more than 45 degrees edit in a 737 800  ok and this does not make the airliner any better great video though the lm 100j went inverted at an air show tho  is he doing an immelmann  amazing bird get in the notch well if you were directly above the crowd then how could you see the crowd  amp x200b because i was inverted ma am  yes because obviously these planes can do this fully loaded like that a400 doing those crazy turns for that promo vid so smooth lol hope the pax got centrifuge training bank angle bank angle  love the paint scheme  oh god u savevideo     for savevideo amp 32 amp 32 amp 32 amp 32 removal request for savevideo amp message amp 32 amp 32  amp 32 amp 32   saints row plane  i wish my pilots would give me this kind of ride on the way into the airport buckle up and look out the left window   bank angle bank angle  watching the wing and engine wiggle the first time i was on a dreamliner definitely shocked me  contrary to how it may sound at first wiggly is more durable than completely rigid that potential energy has a way to be dissipated instead of straining the airframe yep if it is wiggling it ai not breakin    heh it is like when you toss a brick into a washing machine it makes great music  that frog croaked spectacularly  it is incredible that the one set of rotors are able to fail without hitting the other rotors  it helped they are bound by a prop shaft and both driven through a single gearbox  so did it pass or fail that test  yes heh it looks like a dancing frog so a 2h repair  some speed tape and it is good to go  not the speed tape again  s n curve has entered the chat   if they remembered to put in all the fasteners i saw a picture of their flex test then realized i has nothing to worry about reminds me of a line in popular mechanics i read as a kid the bodies inside the aircraft would fall apart long before the airframe does  also the final report on the columbia accident  consequently lethal trauma occurred to the unconscious or deceased crew due to the lack of upper body support and restraint   so 6 point harness hans and helmets for everyone and hope your insides do not get jostled around too much  that is horrifying  that is engineering the safety limit is the passengers could not survive designing past that is not needed so we will add 10percent just in case   154  bang  154  old boeing guy told me about seeing it in person and then everyone having to clean bird crap off all the open air desks on the factory floor because the pigeons in the rafters went fucking ballistic the camera cut is so quick afterwards because dozens of birds caused the assembled people to duck and cover from the the hitchcock movie they were suddenly in  flapping torsional flutter is a thing though and with higher flexibility it becomes easier to trigger flutter so you get new problems having a big mass engine in front has a stabilising effect if you compare engine types and flexibility over generations you can see that with increasing flexibility and engine mass the engine moves forward  you would think fatigue becomes a problem if it wiggles  fatigue would still be a problem even if the motion was minimal it is more about cyclic loading than displacement the structure can and is designed to be able to withstand many cycles without failing due to fatigue enough to survive the aircraft is entire life  fatigue is such a well studied thing by now in aviation and materials metallurgy surely planes are extremely overengineered to avoid any catastrophic fatigue failures and there is also constant inspection for fatigue cracks replacement etc those single crystal turbine blades seem to be the only issue bc flaws can be hard to detect and one fails occasionally e g southwest 1380  but what is stopping catastrophic oscillation i mean im sure they account for all this crap but i want to know so i feel better and not think of those old suspension bridges tearing themselves apart before we knew better  those are called resonance frequencies and you can bet your ass they measure those and damp them by introducing parts which change the frequency if it is found to overlap with natural vibrational modes  counterpoint it is boeing  like an onomatopoeia  same reason that any building generally over 10 floors is designed to move and sway in wind  it is absolutely fascinating is not it we have a pilot in our family and he always tells me flexibility durability  he is currently flying the dreamliner coming from a cargo 767 and even he was shocked when he saw the wings flex for the first time do not worry about the engines and the wings they are designed to endure much much more than that  that plane is nothing short of a masterpiece the engineering behind it is amazing  larger dimmable windows loud noise reducing chevrons low fuel consumption and the dreamliner has an airframe comprising nearly 50percent carbon fiber reinforced plastic and other composites it is by far the most comfortable airliner i have had the chance to fly with  the one thing about the dimmable windows is they do not go completely opaque i have had a 787 flight heading west where the blazing late evening sun was shining through the dimmed window for about six hours we were flying at a speed that stopped the sun from fully setting for a long time  i actually loved them used them as a solar filter to take a photo of the sun with my pixel 8 pro caught a fuckin sunspot even check it out   i am told this is why a lot of regulars prefer the a350 have flown on a 787 and while the windows were clever i did not care for them not had a chance to fly on an a350 to compare  i love flying on both for different reasons i like the large dimmable windows on the dreamliner whereas most a350s have tail cams that we can watch live feed from the seat that is interesting i loved them personally i liked being able to dim the cabin while still having a bit of a view  i have been on a few where cabin crew have disabled the dimming buttons on each individual window i liked the ability to choose the other thing is that the crew can remotely control them which i can totally get for takeoff and landing but it is frustrating if you are claustrophobic  flip side the benefit the whole cabin gets when they are autodimmed in the blazing sun prevents that one person from having their blind fully open i know there is a lot to be said about doing what you want if you have paid for a window seat but if you are the only person insistent on having your window open and it is absolutely blinding another passenger you are kinda an asshole  i do not know why people are downvoting this i was on an 8 hour flight to the us last week in the aisle seat person on the window seat left their window open and was just sleeping the whole time while the rest of the row got blinded most of the way close it if you are not looking at the view  feel the same way about them i was excited that i could dim them without completely blocking the view but once i had the sun on my side for most of the 14 hours it takes from the us to japan i did not want to live that ever again xd i actually got curious and searched if they were being put in the 737 max and 777x was surprised to find they are not on the max but i am  at least that the 777x will have ones that are 100 times darker and blocking out 99 999percent of light would at least alleviate that problem you mention  there is a reason why the electronic shades are an option on the 777x even though they are supposed to block more light and work faster i will forever marvel at this aircraft heard that it is a lot smoother of a ride because of that wingflex definitely need to fly on one soon  i flew the 787 and my eyes nearly popped out of my sockets watching the wing flex upward during takeoff it is a heck of an experience even after a 10 hour flight i felt well rested it is an amazing plane to fly in  it is mild turbulence feels more like you are on a boat gently sloshing on waves than a plane 10 000m in the air the a350 and 787 are marvellous planes  cfrp technology is amazing and only getting better and hopefully longevity will increase too making these things fly more efficiently and for longer is the main goal  i flew on the semi similar a380 and it was such a comfortable flight next to no pressure change in the cabin if you have sensitive ears its significan notly quieter take off does not even feel like takeoff the plane just starts to go up and you do not even feel it  the composite construction also allows a higher humidity level which greatly promotes comfort on a 10 hour flight as well as a lower effective cabin altitude higher internal cabin air pressure means more oxygen to the brain means less fatigue apparently  awesome is not it love the 787 despite the recent debacle with boeing  i fly both the 787 and the 777 you feel better after a 787 flight but i would take the 777 every day as a pilot  the composite frame allows both higher pressurization due to tensile strength closer to sea level and higher humidity no metallic oxidation concerns dreamliner indeed but let me know when you get to pilot the 777x for a true comparison it honestly does not seem to make that much of a difference to cabin pressure you start a flight at around 6000 cabin alt the difference is the 787 stays at that level for an entire long haul flight where the 777 slowly creeps upwards with each step climb  a lot of the noise reduction is actually the ultra high bypass ratio on the engine which creates a sound cushioning airflow buffer around the engine it is mostly just a serendipitous byproduct from a more fuel efficient engine design as far as i can tell  the 747 has  in my experience airbus leans towards stiffer designs while boeing tends to allow more flex both can be perfectly safe for the record it is just a design philosophy difference not a safety or quality difference  yeah the 744 has some amazing wing flex i was kinda surprised that the 748 did not have nearly the same amount of flex and i could feel it being a bit stiffer in the turbulence i asked the pilots after a flight if they felt the same way and they affirmed that the 748 can be a rougher ride  yeah i know why this happens and i know that it is completely meant to but it still makes me uncomfortable to see the wing flex and watch those engines wobble like that i remember seeing it properly for the first time in an a380 flying in turbulent air on the way to kuala lumpur i genuinely thought the engines were going to fall off  geee that flex no ge  strongest wings in the business really something to see in action i was able to watch the wing stress test when they finally broke a wing which took an insane amount of force and way past the flex even engineers had planned for  i remember being more weirded out when the overhead bins shook like a cocktail mixer after we landed  it is flapping it is wings to stay in the air common sense  still blows my mind they were able to model fatigue of composites well enough to produce an faa certified widebody in the mid 2000s amazing what access to dod research and personnel will get you in the private sector  do not forget hiring former faa employees  there is actually probably a pretty strict firewall around that dod data you would never get permission to export a plane with composites that the dod did not want exported or really any other tech the dod funded to develop a strategic or tactical advantage now access to the engineers who at one point worked on dod projects that is another story  that is pretty much my point but razor cut down from the implication i meant about former dod personnel and specifically those individuals experience with dod materials i did not intend it to mean access to the actual classified dod docs but i was not specific enough to avoid that conclusion  can someone translate this for the passengers in the sub  composite two or more materials put together to become a new improved material the most commonly used in aerospace industry are carbon fiber and fiber glass both reinforcing some kind of resin the specifics of the fibers and the resin vary but in general these structures are much lighter for the same resistance when compared to traditional materials aluminium for instance fatigue a structure when subjected to loadings that vary in time for instance the wings flexing in turbulence or the cabin being pressurised and depressurised every flight can suffer from a phenomenon called fatigue when tiny cracks may arise in it and get aggravated until it eventually fails but the structure can and will be designed to take that into account the resistance to fatigue depends on several factors but to keep it simple you can make a structure that will only fail due to fatigue after an inconceivably large amount of time making it essentially for all practical applications having an infinite useful lifetime to do that you need a model a mathematical one that is going to be run in a computer simulation we have equations that tell us how these materials and structures behave under several conditions the more accurate the result the more complex and long is the modelling of the structure the thing is composite materials behave in very particular ways which makes them notoriously hard to model mathematically and thus makes it hard to get accurate results from these simulations which is why it is very impressive that the boeing guys actually did a very good job at modelling the composite structures of the 787 also to work around the difficulties of the computer models many of the simulations are then confirmed by real life testing which gives the empirical results needed for the full trust on the design if you have any more questions or if i failed to make some of this more clear feel free to ask right all of that but why was that surprising in the mid 2000s have the models really gotten that much better in 15 or 20 years  to be honest i can not give you a very precise answer on the accuracy of these models 20 years ago since by then i was only 3 but i can tell you from what i have been learning in aerospace engineering school that they have become considerably better during the last few years although composites have been in use for several decades now and the basic math underlying it is even older the extensive use of composites for a whole structure is relatively recent the application of theory might also be trickier than one would imagine and as the demand rises so do the research for it and much research is being made around composites recently also as computers get more powerful so do the simulations and many of these are only feasible with very powerful computers and lastly it is also due to the company is experience with the material they are working with these simulations will give you an answer whether it is right or wrong and it is up for the engineering team to figure out if their job was well done with the recent focus on composites for high end products in the aerospace industry all of these things have improved significan notly over the past years  is not it also because most composites are not isotropic like plastic or metal they are stronger in some directions than others making it very computationally complex to simulate carbon and glass fiber for instance yes i tried to keep it as simple as possible but you are exactly right due to that composite materials also present some weird deformation modes for instance by applying an axial force you can get it to bend which does not happen to isotropic materials all of that adds to the complexity of the model is that why in e g f1 cars the direction the carbon fibre is weaved  matters for their aerodynamics  it is possible yeah i can not say for sure because i know very little about f1 aerodynamics but i do know they make very good use of aeroelasticity effects that is they use the natural deformation of the wings due to aerodynamic forces to improve the aerodynamics of the car and that is linked to the way they deform and thus the way they are built  these aircraft were also built with massive safety factors with respect to fatigue not sure off the top of my head but iirc well above 100x safety factor above what was calculated not sure how much better it has gotten but certainly at the time fatigue of composites was very poorly understood  most planes component safety factors are below 2 due to weight and budget constraint  true for load factors but for fatigue tolerance it can be a lot higher it is not just about materials either you can improve fatigue isafety factor by increasing inspection or replacement frequency etc you are right though in that for fatigue it is not normally called a isafety factor i just used that language because people know what it means  yeah this guy engineers today a stress analyst runs a fem on their laptop before lunch 20 years ago would have taken a dedicated high performance machine a two days to solve that same fem it is not the model it is moore is law edit clarity think about your desktop pc in the early 2000s the phone in your hand blows that out of the water in terms of compute power others have mentioned computing power committed are approximately 32x more powerful today than they were 20 years ago but another thing to keep in mind is that while we have known the equations for these models since the 60s and 70s with refinements in the 80s 90s 00s 10s and even still today we are still gathering the data to actually feed into them to simulate a mechanical structure or really anything you need  computing resources mathematical models empirical data on the materials being studied for example a subsonic fluid simulation can be run on a powerful desktop commuter today the models for subsonic for are well understood and we have entire databases of fluid properties like specific weight specific volume surface tension viscosity etc and all of those values for different temperatures and pressures but that is today in the 2000s these databases were rare and probably proprietary in the 90s and 80s they were probably more like tables and charts and you had to interpolate the values you actually wanted and pray that there was not some weird phenomenon that existed right at the values you were interpolating running those simulations were just as computationally expensive then at they are today but computer resources were more rare so you would simplify your models and or simulations because all the engineers had to essentially share the same computers mainframes just for running simulations and you could not hog it for a full week without a very good reason so we have more powerful computers we have more advanced models and we have larger and more detailed datasets about more and more materials we can model a lot these days a lot more than we could even a decade or two ago  this is a great answer thanks man this comment section has beautifully become a nice engineering discussion models have improved but it is often about numbers simplifying things slightly you break something up into little triangles or other shapes and then each link in the triangle is solved for with a set of equations and then it is neighbors more computing power let is you solve more triangles faster giving you quicker results or finer resolution with your triangles the design started around 2003 that year amd released the first 64bit consumer computer chip apple released itunes and android released friendster and the pirate bay launched captchas were published at an idea mozilla foundation was founded myspace and the wikimedia foundation were founded a lot has changed in software and hardware capabilities  my company writes the software that does this sort of simulation modelling but for a different industry the compute power and time required to accurately simulate different conditions is immense like we run our models on not just one server but clusters of super high performance servers that measure their ram in terabytes doing this in the 2000s would have been insane we are talking about resources probably costing hundreds of millions if not billions  the math involved is really complicated and the fibers are so thin that it is really hard to precisely fabricate according to the mathematical predictions but in practice the industry is really really conservative so it took them decades to develop standards in order to certify this new type of material slower than the progress of material modelling it was unlocked by alien tech reverse engineering joking here    you are assuming they modeled it at all  fyi they requested a local large aerospace manufacturer to do an analysis on their structure amp manufacturing processes but were not happy with the price so they never followed through oooops  they went with the equally accurate methodology of praying that it works i mean sure the fact they bought expired composites did not help either nor did the fact that the composites they used were intended for tension loads and they were putting it under a compression cycle so yeah they failed to model their composites but they made a lot of poor choices well before they even got to that point  alien technology go wiggle wiggle   gt in the mid 2000s you say that as if the mid 2000s were some sort of dark ages where we only had photovoltaic casio pocket calculators  wind turbine blades have been using composites for a long time and have some of the highest cycle counts of any fatigue load case they have validated a lot of high cycle composite fatigue models and we have actually got a really good understanding of how that works now  and etops  wing does not bother me but that engine flexing is a little freaky especially if you ever see the engine mount what is it 3 bolts  i think they are hollow shear pins i am sweating even with all that air blowing in through the hole in the side  or blind rivets  is that the one with a hole in the middle  maybe they forgot to tighten them never know these days    actually i was not kidding but for the 737 and 767 it turns out it is 6 or 8 bolts 12 for the triple  prob 1 because boeing flew on one of these last weekend and sat just behind the engine mount crazy how much these flex upwards during takeoff and climb i knew it was safe but the monkey inside me was panicking that it was gonna tear itself off and over top of the wing  whats crazy to me is how that turbine fan and compressor handle that engine shake so well and remain balanced i think i saw once the fan blades have such a tiny clearance to the fan case on the order of a millimeter or two  and how do they not crash into the nacelle  the nacelle interior is apparently coated in an abradable liner that can be safely worn down by fan blade rub good thread on this phenomenon here  i have had the opportunity to inspect the inside of a jet engine with a borescope and what amazed me is that they use a metal honeycomb structure on the inside of the casing that is designed to easily be worn away by the blades themselves to to ensure the tightest fit possible another cool thing i noticed was that the blades behind the combustion stage were hollow and had little holes on the trailing edge air is pumped through through them for cooling  they do takes me back when we first had a flight on a a380 my mom was freaking out and could not sleep for the entire flight because the plane was too quiet and also because when we went through a bit of turbulence the engine was wiggling like in this video my dad being the pilot he is was as calm and unfazed as a easter island statue and my brother was getting motion sickness looking at it resulting in me bursting of laughter the reference is legendary  if it makes you feel better it will flex around 25 feet before snapping although i personally would not want to witness that much flex myself  i visited one of the factories where they make these and they claimed that they demonstrated the wing flex by bending them upwards until they touched each other is tips  that should have been recorded and put in the safety video for passengers as someone who would be put off by the engine flex this would definitely put me at ease  that is an exaggeration but they can flex  not quite that far but about 154 percent max loads that the plane could ever experience in flight which is about 45 degrees up  this is also a 777 which does not have composite wings i suspect the 787 wings will bend a bit more at those loads not all the way around but i would guess somewhere around 50 degrees here is a picture of the 787 in that same test  never saw that but there is a video of the wings bending ssiigggnifican notly like they were 45 degree ls before they broke it truly put my mind a little more at ease seeing that  you missed out on the weird flap that to the far right to goes up and down edit i am okay with the flex it is when engineering non flex is my issue someone get some tape  the flaperon  that is a flaperon during cruise the outboard flaps are locked so it is just the inboard flaperon that is active it is tied into the turbulence abatement systems so it is constantly making little adjustments all flight or in this case bigger ones  i am getting weirded out how lifelike the wings motions are compared to what my brain expects for an airplane it makes me think these are actual metal birds  i was on an a330 yesterday and the lack of flex was concerning then we hit a patch of turbulence and i realized we were just smooth sailing most the time it was also the first plane i was on where i did not see any speed tape this is the first time i have seen an engine wobbling since the engine wobbles sideways is it correct to assume it contributes to the shaking of the aircraft because it changes the direction of the exhaust thereby causing oscillation  the wobbling you are seeing is barely a few degrees in either direction and it is mostly the nacelle moving the change in exhaust velocity is negligible  nah you really do not feel anything it is wild there is a reason the 87 is named the dreamliner last time i saw an engine move like that was when i was watching a pod race  watching that engine move gave me anxiety i always thought someone just welded the engine to the wing quick search confirmed i was incorrect  engines are indeed barely attached some older models of aircraft had bolts that at specific harmonic frequencies or stresses would self sheer dropping the engine if something went really wrong although there has been a crash where a bolt failed while within parameters causing partial release i can not remember exactly what flight it was but to avoid confusion i am not talking about the american airlines takeoff bolt failure that did not have the specific function and failed because of bad maintenance practices american flight 191 partial release on takeoff destroyed the hydraulics  this was because american neglected to follow proper maintenance procedure  you mean shoving the engine up and into a mount that requires millimetre precision using a forklift and cracking the slot in the process is not recommended by the manufacturer but the proper maintenance procedure takes hours ow my corporate wallet s  gt american airlines takeoff bolt failure was that the one where one pin bolt whatever failed and the engine went up and over the wing  they are supposed to do that the rear pins are made to be weaker than the others and break first so that the engine rotates and goes over the wing instead of hitting it and damaging it  weird flex but ok    she flexy she had them bolts with the door the whole faa was looking at her she lost her door the next thing you her stock went low low low  straight bars  love me a nice clear air turbulence especially with a nice wing view as you got  i usually doe central biz honestly still love them engines spooling up  i know it is a good and perfectly normal thing but it still creeps me the hell out  just think of it as air ride suspension  my statics prof said to the class once that he made the mistake of telling an old lady did you know the engines are designed to fall off  right before a flight she was not so sure she wanted to go on the plane after hearing that they must have seen plenty of this exact type of engine nacelle flexing shaking during simulation testing and certification right it is okay right  not being sarcastic and would love someone to put me at ease  if you want to get an idea of how much the wings get tested for flexing this is a good  of how much deflection the wings of a 777 can go before failing behold the third most shared clip on this sub what are the 1st and 2nd  i do not know the first but the second is this  i thought they fixed that problem years ago though  always like seeing this video here it is so cool yeah iirc the 787 is wing can flex so far before failing that you have to worry about the darn thing losing lift before it will break most wings are like that tbf there has never been a recorded instance of wings failing due to turbulence in the history of aviation that i know of  talk about thrust vectoring   i flew on a 9 to singapore and had a prime view of the engine 3 seats back from the 2nd exit door watching the engine wobble was cool but unusual i am used to a320s    genx engine i know they are supposed to do that and that it is more durable than being completely rigid but i still wish it would not do that  the wing flex is amazing the engine wiggle with that tiny attachment surface area is panic attack inducing it is apples to oranges i know but  did not knew 787 came with ge engine ge rr customer dependent they call it the dreamliner remember kids nightmares are dreams too  just missing some bolts  shake it baby the b 47 wing flexed as much as 17 5 feet  i am not an expert but i am pretty sure they carry a spare on the other side of the airplane just in case  i remember going through severe turbulence on a 767 and watching the whole length of the cabin flex was pretty cool to me but my fellow passengers said it made them nervous  reminds me a little of the ongoing flexible wing controversy in f1  but damn that wing is bending a huge amount it is amazing really must have really freaked out a few people when they first saw it a decade ago  alcohol lots of alcohol will numb you from this sight  forget the flexing my eyes are drawn towards the patchwork wing surface the 787s i have taken had speed tape applied liberally on the wing  i love the 787 flex   if it wobbles too much would not it contributing to fatigue  it is called flutter it is tested for during developmental flights looking for harmonic coupling and divergence which can be bad  my logical and rational brain this is what it is designed to do metal that does not flex under stress is more easily broken my monkey brain metal wings are not supposed to flap  that is what you get when you make your plane out of pencil leads and glue s having played war thunder i know that means it is close to coming off due to overspeed i would be shitting myself if i were you i know its supposed to do this for the same reason sky scrapers move with the wind but fuck this just makes me uncomfortable  watching the boeing is wing wiggle prior to january 2024 oh cool amazing what composite material can do after january 2024 and we are gonna die  boeing and 787 pilots this plane is been wiggling pressurising landing and taking off getting hit by lightning etc for 10 years now i wonder what all the composite materials are like now  with the recent events i am not sure how much wiggly i am comfortable with  it is a boeing maybe they forget the screws do not let the fia see the flexi wings  faa seen that and certified that 12 years ago the wings can flex much further than what you are watching  i imagine that is what it is supposed to do but it does not exactly make me want to fly again any time soon  it depends on tail and rotation geometry if you take a low to the ground plane and keep stretching it such as say the 737 you get pretty close to the ground on rotate and landing for reference the liftoff attitude at flaps 1 for a 737 900er is 8 tailstrike pitch attitude is 10 interestingly the majority of tailstrikes will actually happen on landing when you are slowing a little too much and you perhaps bounce and do not control the energy super well it is amazing how fast 10 can get there  thanks for sharing real world information  absolute madlad taking off at flaps 1 it is actually amazing the amount of times you will  that was the most common takeoff flap setting when i flew the 73ng real men take off with spoilers extended  and thrust reversers   i miss that man and every day i wait for ryan gosling to pick up his mantle  true story he leslie nielsen spent a lot of his last years as a bch club member guest at my ex is resort in fla you could find him mostly at the bar he was a gentleman always smiled was kind to the staff and other guests at the resort you laugh but there is a glider i fly where you are supposed to take off with spoilers 1 4 open apparently it helps the ailerons gain effectiveness at a lower airspeed you stow em as soon as you get roll authority holy crap i did this on my pre solo check flight many years ago in a viking winch launch i am tall 201cm my knee rested under the airbrake lever pressed up against it anyway this particular launch we hit a bump in the grass before rotate and my knee hit the lever and unlocked it with the rest of the noise i did not notice everyone on the ground heard the thunk half way up the launch the airbrakes open fully presumably sucked open by the airflow over the wing i remember shouting to the instructor behind me before i slammed the lever closed very confused ironically it was my highest launch of the day  lol it takes a lot of power to climb with full spoilers thankfully a winch checks that box lol we used to have one of the only winches in the us some years ago 500hp and 0 60 in 0 7 seconds yeeeeehaaaaaw which glider is that  ash 26e i am very curious what glider that would be that sounds like a very weird feature  it is actually fairly common in high performance gliders it pushes some of the air that would normally pass beside the ailerons over them instead the ailerons are quite slim from front to back and it aids in their effectiveness at single digit airspeeds  with the parking brake set too why are the wings coming out mav  for some reason that line really annoyed me i mean all of the other willing suspension of disbelief aside i can not believe that a top gun grad and allegedly one of the best at that would not understand why one would extend the wings on an f 14 or that they can  i took it as why are you extending the wings now on this taxiway we are not at the runway yet line more questioning the timing of the wing sweep for takeoff vs the actual sweep itself  he understands what the functional reason for extending the wings is he is asking why maverick is doing it while pointed at a bunch of obstacles that will probably kill them if they attempt a takeoff  i thought that movie did a disservice to every pilot that was not maverick in the original they made it clear that every pilot in the program was exceptionally good and that the competition was extremely close then in the second one everyone is just a punching bag for maverick to appear like a god  i think the point is that maverick is only the best when he breaks the rules like the first film he took out viper only when he broke the altitude deck in the second film he designed the mission by breaking the rules the other pilots were taught to fly around i e beyond the safe limits of the plane just as it starts with him breaking the rules with the darkstar i do agree the other pilots were made to seem kinda lackluster anyway  to be fair rooster never flew the f 14 or any other variable geometry aircraft it was not all that long ago that i myself learned that the f 14s swing wing was automatic and not something that was controlled by the pilot that being said yeah the line was put there just to draw the viewer to the swing wing in the first place and for a bit of top gun 1 0 nostalgia  too be faaaaaaair r unexpectedletterkenny letterkenny is fucking awesome i know more than one person from exactly that type of small ontario town my wife is from a place like that  unless it is hot or a short runway you basically always use flaps 1  yeah i am confused at that comment flap 1 takeoffs are the norm in most situations  standard procedure the majority of 737 takeoffs at my company are flaps 1 flaps 1 was pretty standard at my last company we used boeing opt and that is what it spit out   gt it is amazing how fast 10 can get there that is what she said 777x has an electronic tail strike protection system no bumper  please do not tell me it automatically noses over when it detects an immanent tail strike they do not have a good track record with that sort of thing  it jumps you mean it boeing is i will see myself out yeah you should bounce yeah i will hop right on that go on skid dattle  who you talking to he already took off  that one went over my head this thread lifted my spirit i hope he will ok he was touch and go yea i will catch the airbus on the way out careful that is going northrup bound this is why reddit comments are where the real treasure is at lol that is not how you spell pain  100percent heard that in my mind exactly as you intended  jumps main gear suddenly extends remind me to bring my 777x to the next lowrider meetup should win easily eta confirmed the system jumps here is a video of it in action    looking at that massive gear so much bigger dick than any tractor or road machine just re emphasizes how freakin awesome it must to land that baby  i was not sure what i was expecting when i clicked that link but it was not that lol i can not believe i fell for this  oh boy how i wanted to take a ride on that when i was younger  take the upvote you got me  that is the 747 x sp not 777x take the stinking upvote better than being rick rolled  alright you got me  does it make the jump jack sound  hydraulic jump system it does not have to nose over it is fly by wire so it just stops accepting pitch inputs that would cause a tail strike while the crouch sensors on the main gear are toggled  right and if the sensor goes bad and the plane stops accepting pitch inputs that are necessary to avoid a crash after v1  probably a wow switch function there is logic that will ignore a faulty wow switch there are reduant switches as well the true tragedy of mcas was not just that they kept it out of literature to avoid retraining but they only used a single aoa sensor and did not have any logic to disable the system if that sensor failed worse if the data was faulty it was not seen as faulty because it was not compared to other flight parameter data it never should have made it on the airplane in that condition it violates both boeing policy and faa guidelines for automated systems and safety of flight it now uses two aoa sensors and compares that data to other expected parameters if anything does not jive it automatically disables autopilot which disables mcas which was what pilots were supposed to do since failure of the ghost mcas presented as runaway trim  that is why sensors are redundant and usually double redundant one sensor per pilot plus a standby sensor on one side and undergo regular maintenance there are also cases where protections may be either automatically inhibited or easier to override during some phases of flight or where a failed sensor can be detected and its inputs discarded at the cost of that protection being in place though as far as i know this is always very clearly communicated to the pilots that last case happened with  in 1996 during a 20 day stay in the dominican wasps are thought to have obstructed one of the pitot tubes before the incident flight the pilots failed to diagnose the issue before flying into the sea despite clear warnings about instrument disagreements and lessons from that report have been integrated into pilot training since incidents like the 737 max mcas issues were the result of poor design sure but they were a compound issue   gt that is why sensors are redundant boeing wait what  lol the whole reason people are talking about single sensors is because boeing royally screwed the pooch with mcas  sensors absolutely should and usually are redundant but mcas is still very fresh in peoples minds boeing needs to re earn our trust in this case they need to lay out every detail of the design of something like this so more than just their eyes are on it and any deficiencies can be brought to the forefront no more designing in the dark like they did on the max  i imagine that systems like mcas will be receiving a lot more scrutiny from aviation regulators and certification bodies in the future hopefully the re testing the max had to undergo before returning to service will serve as a baseline i do not expect the design of these systems to be made public at any point  tail strike avoidance augmentation system fed by a single ultrasonic distance sensor pushes the nose down if it determines a tail strike is imminent no simulator training needed s of course  it is so automatic that no one even does not have to know about it  except the crash investigators   gt fed by a single ultrasonic distance sensor no they deleted that in the final design so it is part of the mcas system is reliance on a single aoa vane along with the coffeepot and the aft lav flush system  optical sensor facing the coffee pot i like it  that is how a 300 behaves like a 200 no training needed to take into account that it is 10m longer  the tsaas would never randomly trigger nose down in normal flight and kill hundreds of people now would it ahh the mysterious tsaas system  mcas had it all wrong everyone knows nose up keep you in the air not nose down s  gt everyone knows nose up keep you in the air not nose down s one of the pilots of air france flight 447 did   gt 777x has an electronic tail strike protection system later build 77ws have this too since removing the physical tailskid saves over 100kgs of weight one of my colleagues managed to do a tail strike anyway  yea i was thinking the thing has got to be heavy otherwise it would snap right off like nothing i may not be an aircraft designer but a disposable design makes sense really strikes are rare and you probably need to visit the hangar for some checklists anyway may as well swap an impact device while you are up there yea but every kilogram is important on an airplane 100 is is huge my point was making something light and destroyable on strike i am sure they have thought of that though i assume that the brunt of the weight comes from the structure where its mounted it does not help having a tail strike device if it just gets pushed into the main structure i think most of the skidblok itself is sacrificial and therefore quite heavy just the end was the heavy part is the mounting hardware and the hydraulics used to extend it   gt removing the physical tailskid saves over 100kgs of weight this is the weight of one extra fat person in row 45  there is a lil yellow fin where the tail skid used to be and there are two wires in the fin that send inputs to prox sensor electronic units when an open or short is sensed by the pseu is so it is not like its any better now you just scrape through the fin and the wires and a short or open occurs and sends signals to the flight deck through the aims system i would rather have that bumper  well in theory you do not need a bumper with electronic tsp but if you do hit its good to know  recent airbus have one also it can be surpassed if needed  i think you mean bypassed  maybe english is not my native language  surpassed means to exceed or be better at something eg the concert surpassed your expectations bypassed means to go beyond or avoid some sort of limitation eg to bypass the safety limit or even bypass a town  tailstrike so hard it surpasses the capabilities of the tsp  i will try   jkjk i do not actually fly planes  but the word surpass has an implication of a positive or desired outcome for example although you could say that the destruction from the volcano surpassed all previous records it sounds weird because of the implication that the destruction was the desired outcome in this case it would be better to say it exceeded the capabilities  if my memory is correct concorde has a little wheel instead of a skid  correct they have it extended on the concorde shown at the museum of flight in seattle  i remember going inside that aircraft mostly because my wife has claustrophobia and took two steps inside and said nope and waited for me outside  not helped by the mof concord having plexiglass over all the seats so you are basically shimmying through the aisle with your arms up the whole time uss intrepid let is you take a seat on it yeah that was tight i did not realize how small the fuselage was to begin with but that plexiglass definitely did not help  it is about the size of a dc 9 inside sure looks larger in photos from the exterior but even up close outdoors it becomes evident that it is not really a large airplane it just has a big wing  uss intrepid lets you rent it out for parties  they are definitely the cool concord parents  this is exactly how i build airplanes in ksp it is the difference in a reusable plane and one that leaves parts behind on takeoff those are to protect the fuselage on the 737 when ryanair land and the suspension bottoms out  for ryanair it is not called landing but re entry lol do all boeings have them could imagine only the 737 having them as it is lower than the a320 family   i know next to nothing about airplanes so maybe this is entirely obvious but what do you mean by they are not geometrically limited on rtation like there is something else that doens t allow them to rotate that much stall speed perhaps    hmm okay that explains it a bit but i do not think i fully get it yet for the shorter aircraft you have the same situation at a lower speed as for the longer aircraft at the higher speed right or is there some other consideration that determines the minimum speed there like just the minimum speed to generate enough lift to remain airborne not climbing but just not falling either and to check when that last thing is true if i understand things correctly with the shorter aircraft you can immediately rotate to your take off angle because your tail will not hit the ground and you can start getting off the ground but for the longer aircraft you have to accelerate a bit more so that you can take off with a lower angle because you are now going faster and thus produce more lift for the same angle i e you need a lower angle to get off the ground is that correct  a plane that is geometrically limited will lift the nose and still accelerate on the ground until the wing generates enough lift at that angle of attack to get the plane off the ground which may only be a few seconds later a plane that is not geometrically limited will take off before a tail strike can happen so your second point is correct  and how about the first part what determines the minimum speed at which you can start to rotate  the lift generated by the wing and the weight of the plane a wing will generate a certain amount of lift depending on speed the faster the plane goes the more lift the wing generates a big plane may weigh more but it may still have the same take off speed as a small plane due to how the wing is designed on the plane the tail skids show up on long stretched models the first 737 is were tiny short and a little plump looking  that is what she said  nope 777 300ers have them but not the newer ones the older ones had it 200lrs never had them probably have an electronic tail strike system now  i think the 200 was short enough that a tail strike was very unlikely in normal operation  aside from some models on 737 i recall those boeings have tail skid 757 300 767 300 300er 767 400 777 300 non er and most 777 300er except newer builds i believe beginning in 2014  the longer a320 versions do like a belly rub too the 737ng series like 800 amp 900 amp max10 all sit very low the ground clearance is low amp the fuselage is long perfect set up for tail strike on rotation and flare they should just fit a tundra tire as a tail wheel and be done with it   would simplify take offs pull the nose up and roll down the runway sitting on the tail gear until you lift off haha  that is how vmu testing is done  i i do that on kerbal space program  i need to try it now i snagged that game free on epic  the 737 sits much lower to the ground and it takes less of an angle on rotation to have a tail strike another reason boeing should have designed and built a clean sheet aircraft instead of the max    this guy fucks      gt 757 chassis they almost certainly considered this at some point airframer r amp d departments are costantly generating new concepts based off old airframe refurbs and pitching them for a given market  but it is made of aluminium and they wanted composite fuselages iirc it is not like the 737 was a composite plane to begin with neither they had to redesign parts with new materials  that is fair though i feel like maybe boeing was also counting on the 787 3 to work out and replace their 757s and they just shat the bed on both that project and the 757 max i hate the 737 and it is the aircraft i predominately fly  they were a simp for that same type certificate the angles are not much different on airbuses either 737 900 9 strikes at 10 degrees a321 strikes at 9 5 11 degrees  of all the reasons they should have done a clean sheet this is not one of them  the main landing gear are much taller on the airbus 321 so being long is slightly less of an issue if you do not rotate flare too extremely it lands fairly flat too the 319 and 320 are short enough to not be an issue  i am not trying to be a party pooper but this is not april fools day and i am not a boeing pilot so i am genuinely curious about this and all we got are jokes some of them are quite funny but when you post a joke that sounds informative and then turns out to be false that kind of sucks for those of us who are here to learn about aviation and have to fly snoop dog airlines in search of the truth anyway go ahead and downvote me i know you want to  if you have been reading r aviation for any length of time you should have noticed that all questions receive perhaps about 90percent joke answers of varying funniness and credibility if you want to get serious answers this is not the place ask on r flying  that is because all of the other commercial planes have a skid guard it is a cabin crew mate typically the new hire who is sole purpose is to sit in the tail and stick their arm out through a small opening to prevent tail strikes it is a good job with great medical  because they were not designed with them  yeah why were not they designed with them because the engineer did not include them  why did not the engineer include them they assumed pilots would pilot why did they assume pilots would because thats their job why is that their job  shut up and eat your broccoli  but mom he started it  because the engineering did not warrant it  why did not the engineer warrant it i do not know we have exhausted my aeronautical knowledge  767 200s i fly do not have them 300s do not all boeing is have them just the longer one is  the 737 has notoriously short landing gear that limits the clearance of the tail during the angle of attack on some takeoffs  most aircraft were designed correctly  a lot do have some type of tail skid but they are only partially useful basically if you were just going to skim the belly of the tail they can prevent the need to repaint it but if you make firm contact with the runway they will not prevent structural damage  because boeing is trying to further stretch a 1960s regional jet to fill the role of the 757 same reason they require a tail stand while loading pax and bags the new 737s are almost 60 feet longer than the first generation  also they were optional at the airlines choice on some boeing models the 757 for instance had a tail skid option offered not all airlines took it i suppose due to the weight and cost  late model 777 300ers also do not have them they do airbus has them but it just does not stick out like this edit i was wrong the airbus does not have one it has an electronic pitch warning system  pretty sure they do not i work around airbuses all day and there is nothing back there but some antennas the lav service panel water panel and the apu not accurate most do not not sure why but airbus planes also sit higher on their wheels so more clearance at takeoff tailstrikes do happen but more on landing for the airbus simply depends on the risk for that particular version of that particular aircraft  they do not need them it is a sign that the manufacturer stretched out an old model as opposed to designing a clean sheet aircraft  not always the b 29 has one   so you distribute the force of a tail strike from the easily replaceable skin to a structural part i think that is rither an optional part or something specially fitted as i have seen very few i believe the idea is to transfer the force of the strike from the skin which will need to be replaced to a load bearing structure which will not the idea being if you smack this thing hard enough to bend the structure it is connected to that structure was going to need to be replaced with or without this thing  it also depends on whether the pressurized vessel would be affected or not which can make things really bad and expensive the last bulkhead of the vessel there is a bad area to have stress structural issues with i do not know if ab b do things differently there though so just educated guess does the hydraulic ram sort of act like a shock absorber or is it mounted to something with some give high density rubber or something similar  if the force is high it is going to transfer to the structure whether it is via the skin or a skidplate those that are skidplate equipped at least planned on it happening and have enough structure backing them to take more than the superficial hit it is only worth doing on certain configurations that are most susceptible to tail strike fuselage length wing geometry gear position etc  it is not the strike it is the drag i have seen photos of an airbus 321 tail strike that looked like several longitudinal feet of skin and structure were shaved off the tail it was bad enough that the question of whether it was a hull loss was on the table  they love the belly rubs all 777 is came from factory with tail strike sensor  if you are using a tail skid is more of a warning tail impact is a major pilot error and that skid will not save the structure wheelie bar i think the correct technical term is wheelie bar hydraulic rams are heavy  a320s have blocks that stop this and the concord had basically a 4th landing gear on the tail  kslc  they mostly do they are just all different designs because not all commercial planes need them  what angle of attack would the queen need for a assrub on the tarmac 30 40 degrees is my guess given how her rear rises sharply  if anyone here has feedback on tailstrike avoidance symbology on the 737 hud let me know  because design and engineering  because all commercial planes are built differently and have different needs  cause once you learn to ride a bike you do not need the training wheels i thought that was the plane is peepee as the plane ages this will get bigger when it hits puberty ruddervators will form then it will be a full fledged air refueling aircraft  looks like it still has that new plane smell yup it is less than a year old n24973 does a new plane smell like a new car  haha it is does not smell like a new plane at all it does look really clean though and really aesthetically lol pleasing to see i was in a 777 200lr about a year ago and i really did not like how some of the paint was chipping off some of the panels granted it was made in 2010 edit extra letter deleted awesome btw what engines were on the 777 200lr u flew  the 777 200lr only has the ge90 110b1l engines you can search its registration n710dn ahh i see awesome not as a pilot but i walked onto a brand new a319 and the first thing i thought was huh this smells like new car  i am just a casual flyer but i stepped onto a swa flight a month ago and about 6ft before i got to the door of the plane i noticed the smell in the jetway entered the plane and asked the flight attendant if the plane was new and she said this was their first revenue flight so take that for what it is someone above me said it does not smell like a new car so idk new planes burn your nose hairs source worked at boeing can someone tell me what that one button next to that switch does  it makes the plane go faster  how many did the concord have then and was the sr71 made completely of them  sr71 cockpit consisted entirely of one giant button labeled shred  x 15 had a bigger button labelled so long slowpoke  it was also presumably painted a bright red  the seat back was made of buttons the faster you we not the more you pressed that is why it was so fast i think you are talking about the chem trails button  do not touch it that is why it is in the auto position  chemtrail switch  what switch lol or where  r whoosh you have been whoooshed ejection seat for unruly passengers  meanwhile in 737 land  they say the engineers took a shotgun to the overhead panel on the 737  the 737 is the epitome of if it ai not broke do not fix it  it is what happens when you just put a fe panel on the ceiling  well until the faa or another regulator say they are not allowed to grandfather the design any further that panel is staying  the 737 is for the pilots who wish they were flying a dc 3 in a leather jacket before atc even existed  sadly the a320 is not any better  it is a much more cohesive design only in abnormal situations does a light go on and most switches are push button type whereas on the 737 it is mainly toggle switches a lot more logical in layout too i think boeing got schooled in overhead design with the a320 and it made a big influence to the 777 design still they are both better than the md95  oh i agree there i was poking a bit of fun that if you do not really know how to read an overhead panel the 320 and the 737 will look similarly daunting  i flew the md95 for over two years that overhead design is leaps and bounds better than the 737  clean love the magnetic compass no matter how advanced and computerized these planes get there is always the 2nd star to the right and straight on til morning gauge in case all else fails  i am an airline guy and i also own an airplane one of the first things i did was remove the stupid whiskey compass for a vertical compass card so much nicer and if something breaks i can at least use it for real granted i only have one primary hsi in my plane where everything in the airline world has at least two  i just learned that the 787 and 777 share the same type rating makes sense after seeing how similar the panels are yeah it is really nice that with a little bit of training the same type rating can be applied to both planes it is good on boeing to do that so they can save costs which benefits both pilots and the airlines well maybe the passengers also lol it does not really benefit pilots they have to now remember 2 sets of limits and procedures and small differences but yes it does benefit the airline thankfully my airline which operates both 777 amp 787 runs them as separate fleets  is there a sticker reminding you to  holy shit that the airplane will fall out of the sky tweet in that article is cringey reminds me of the people who thought that the whole y2k thing would make aerodynamics magically stop working and planes would just fall to the ground  well if you lose the control systems completely the difference will be academic at that point i think they have a ram air system for hydraulics etc etc but i do not want to be the guy who has to prove it all works  you will not be they test these kinds of thing extensively before the plane gets to market  true but  yay i had something to do with that i designed the wiring harnesses to connect to all those units i am very proud of it  aww do you ever take a step back and adore about how sexy that overhead panel is it is sooooooo clean  the panel yes the flight deck yes the entire aircraft yes i did more than the p5 overhead panel loved the whole experience  do they not come with a switch for the no smoking lights any more  i assume that is just always on now  nope we have had a couple iterations since the no smoking sign at first we replaced it with a no electronic devices sign and now on my plane it is a wifi light to let you know when it is available  that is a damn good idea  i know on boeing they use them on the few planes that still have them as memory switches example of it being used as such from mentour aviation  what does the cargo fire panel do  it is used so the pilots can arm discharge fire extinguishers into the cargo compartment when the system is armed it will automatically discharge high pressure bottles into the compartment the crew can discharge more on top of that as needed  light is visible when something it is off or has problem no light is on everything is fine  i am preaching the same thing to executives when they look at numbers why the fuck you need to see green dot on screen if thing is ok and likely miss the yellow or red dot where there is a problem only show problems or warnings  blame me i requested for more green on everything including having all green screens but different shades normal would be hunter green warnings in neon and emerald green they rejected those and my idea to paint the windows green haters gonna hate  how would you tell the difference between a light being out and a green status    preflight step requires to illuminate all lights  which one turns the bass up   surprised it is not boeing brown i wonder how often the pilots really look at that compass  i like to watch it jiggle r nocontext   if i am ever relying on that thing it is a bad bad very bad day definitely not happy  you are literally one step away from using a sextant at that point  i build this plane in charleston it is an amazing aircraft united  ual842 ah might flight track    to answer your first question they are there to illuminate a wider angle for the pilots to see so they have better situational awareness at night to answer your second question there is a strobe light switch at the rightmost which activates the strobe light there is four buttons right above the switches and are in order beacon nav logo and wing the buttons do as follows  the beacon button controls the beacon light i think above and below the plane the nav button controls the port and starboard lights which are red and green respectively the logo button controls the tail light which lights up the horizontal stabiliser or the tail fin and the wing button controls the flashing and steady wing lights which alerts other planes in the vicinity where the plane is    i have heard it is so that in a case where there is smoke in the cabin and pilots can not see they can at least feel which button is which this is the most correct answer  ex i use feel while driving my car all the time to adjust the cabin temp radio etc that way i can keep my eyes on the road those cars with the touch screen interfaces for their radios and climate controls are annoying because all the buttons feel the same so you are forced to actually look down and play around instead of paying attention outside  it is so that you can identify them by feel  i am not exactly sure but i guess it is there to emphasise their importance sometimes other pilots on the ground may not see an aircraft until their landing lights are in view landing lights are very bright so they can be seen from afar and help to aid the pilots in low visibility or dark conditions   gt the wing button controls the flashing and steady wing lights which alerts other planes in the vicinity where the plane is you are thinking of the strobe lights the wing button activates lights that illuminate the leading edges of the wings this is often used to keep tabs on possible icing the wing lights are very seldom activated during flight and are not there to signal other planes  have volvo design it next time has that new dreamliner smell amp x200b  mmm new plane smell and feel  a boeing cockpit that is not from the 1960s we have come a long way  can can i touch it  why did they misspell the word as disc  it actually is not a misspelling those buttons are there in case the generators fail and need to be disconnected hence the use of disc shortened from disconnect the drive light that illuminates is just to tell the pilots that the driver of the generator has been disconnected the 787 is very redundant and as you can see it has two generators per engine so even if it has one generator completely fail it can still go on pretty much unaffected for the rest of the flight  thanks that is the first time in a while i have seen someone correctly spell it disc  l r and aft ext power why so many also i see the irs has been simplified from off align nav att to an off on setting so att mode is automatic  the 787 is more electric than other planes and has a starting capacity of 1 45 megawatts it requires so much because more components are electric than other conventional planes like the 777 where the brakes and air conditioning are using hydraulics and the engine bleed air respectively  so if electrics fails plane dies  nope the plane has a lot of redundancies each engine on the lower right has two generators so even if one generator completely fails in flight the other three generators can power the plane for the rest of the flight it is like how with 4 engine planes if one engine fails the plane can go the rest of the way on the surviving engines i read that the engines are electrically more powerful and can supply two generators instead of one on the 777 and i think the a350 edit the plane can also use the apu auxiliary power unit and the battery to provide power to the electric systems  hmm i mean the 777 also has 2 sets of generators primary and backup and does not rely on so mucb electrics maybe i am just an old fart  about the irs is nav and att mode switching automatic if an adc fails i only see an off on setting  i think so it should do so automatically i do not know for sure because i have not read up on the flight manuals of the 787 yet  dayum we livin in the future boyes  the irs it should read ers earth reference systems it still require time to align the pitot and static adms air data module convert pitot and static air pressures to a digital signal and send them to the fce flight control electronics each iru and ahru has three ring laser gyros and three linear accelerometers using these and air data from the flight control electronics fce the ers calculate  attitude pitch roll and yaw position latitude and longitude true heading magnetic heading inertial velocity vectors linear accelerations angular rates track angle wind speed and direction inertial altitude vertical speed ground speed drift angle flight path angle the irus and ahrus calculate hybrid inertial gps data and send it to the common data network the common data network cdn is a digital data network that moves system information between various airplane systems that are connected to it  this is not 787 info but the 747 400 8f have two apu generators the plane requires a lot of power to just sit on the ground being loaded or unloaded so apu gen 1 powers most of the plane while apu gen 2 technically powers the cargo loading systems of the plane  pilots were fussy on the 777 did not want me posting pictures from the cockpit any specific reason i thought if you have seen one in google images you have seen it all do layout and equipment very country to country for the 777  hmm it pretty much depends on the pilots and if you do not have ones that are friendly and allow you to take photos sorry you will not have the chance to i would not think why they would do that though cockpits are amazing and so pleasing to see most of the us pilots i have met are quire friendly so i have got lots of shots of cockpits before with your second question yes the cockpit options vary from airline to airline say a us airline might want to use pounds gallons fahrenheit while other airlines might use kilograms litres and celsius it varies from airline to airline edit typo it was not so much that i could not take picture i was told not to put them up on social media yeah mph for americans and kmh for most of the rest i suppose that is just labels you would not have different hardware though though you might have less depending on budget maybe leave out the blinkers and carpets you will have a picture of almost all cockpits on the internet usually given out by the folks who build it  which one is the nos button  i flew on a united 787 from sfo to ppt in november and it was my best flying experience ever hands down you are living my dream sitting upfront  this is pretty neat it is a bit simpler than what you would see on a 738 and way simpler than what 767s ship with i am liking that boeing seems to be following in airbus is footsteps in terms of reducing how many things a human operator can mess up  the 737 is a bit of an odd one as updating that panel would require a new type rating which airlines do not want so until it is finally retired the 737 oddness will remain  is it just the o h panel that requires a new type rating cause the engine monitor gauges totally changed between the og ng winglet max generations and i think the pedestal is a fair bit different overall as well  it is relieving that cockpits are becoming increasingly more and more pilot friendly coming from the 707 in the 1950s with pretty much all switches to now in the late 2010s with the 787 and upcoming 777x they also look cooler and more aesthetic for aviation enthusiasts let is face it the older cockpits are way less pilot and user friendly than now which makes things look sexier yes i used that word lol than what it was 20 30 40 years ago  so no shit zombie apocalypse could a guy with a ged and a give em hell attitude get one of these things flying  not a chance the amount of system knowledge that is required would be extremely difficult to comprehend without actual aviation knowledge flying experience  nice but i will still take the bus only one missing is the 787 funny story this picture is almost 14 years old this picture was taken 7 8 07 the day the first 787 was rolled out to the public at everett the aircraft would not take to the skies for months later  that explains a bunch thanks  they did it again a few years later with the 747 8 and 787 i think every airframe but the 707 was different  the 707 just looks so right  my first thought was wow that looks just like a kc 135 then i realized i am dumb  fun fact the 135 is not a 707 it descended from the 367 80 just like the 707 did but is subtlety different enough dimensions control surfaces etc that its internal boeing designation is 717 no relation to the md bastard of the same name that you see in this photo  also there was a seperate kc 707 that israel and others purchased  yep actually the 707 in the photo is a privately owned refueling tanker omega  its okay i thought it was a 135 aswell i had no idea the 707 was so big awesome to see it relative to the others does the perspective here distort it that much or is it really that large a plane  the 707 120 and 757 200 are pretty similar in size on paper use the taxiway lines to compare wingspans the 707 727 737 and 757 share the same basic fuselage cross section with the same fuselage diameter  you are totally right that the 727 737 and 757 all can trace their lineage back to the 707 but to be pedantic all they share is the upper lobe of the fuselage they all have a kind of two semicircles smushed together fuselage cross section the 777 was boeing is first fully round fuselage and the lower part under the passenger deck is pretty different on all of them the 757 is by far the most different of the 4 with it is very different nose profile designed to fit a cockpit almost identical to the 767 is to allow a common type rating and interestingly the lower lobe of the fuselage behind the wing is actually taller than the lower fuselage in front of it one curiosity of this common lineage is you can trace the 737max is recent problems all the way back to the layout choices made on the 707 80 really when the 727 was developed from the 707 and the 737 from the 727 there was no good reason to deviate much from the landing gear height first designed in the 50s that short landing gear only made to accommodate the low bypass turbofans of the time is exactly what made the 737 use more and more radical solutions throughout its life to accommodate larger engines which has concluded with the tragic mcas problem  it was not only that deviating from the lower landing gear height did not make sense it would have made the 737 unusable at a lot of the airports at the time that did not have jet bridges or had jet bridges that were too small to accommodate taller aircraft  also manual baggage loading at small airports  probably a trick to the eye from the angle of the camera amp lens since 707 have the same sized fuselage as 727 amp 737 from what i know  i mean it was big but most of the distortion is probably coming from the shape of the taxiway intersection single aisle though i think   gt the aircraft would not take to the skies for months later months later you mean two years later  2 years 24 months math checks out  thank you reddit once again a neat airliner pic   and the 720  the 720 got weird nomenclature for the most part it was just a shorter 707 today it would just get a special designation like 707 500 or whatever but boeing had not really finalized their numbering system for their passenger jets yet point being the 720 really did not need to be featured separately just like they did not show all three generations of 737 that existed at the time  right 720 was sorta the same idea that went into the 737sp  and one too many the md95  what are you talking about  boeing 717 is what the md95 was called after the merger  717 dc9max i mean if they integrated it into their lineup then it deserves the spot it was as much a boeing as concorde was an airbus nothing about it except the stickers was boeing  similar to the cseries a220 the real 717 was a version of the 707 boeing had absolutely no input into the design of the md95 just acquired it and rebranded it in the merger then shut it down c 17 also is boeing by name alone for the same reasons though obviously not pictured here where does the md 90 fit into this whole mix  what people know as the 717 today was developed completely by md as the md 95 latest kid in the dc 9 family it is essentially a slightly shorter md 90 with a modernized cockpit meant to have commonality with the md 11 and with brand new engines you can still find promotional images of the md 95 from early in its development but not a single unit built was painted as an md 95 boeing merged with md a year before the md 95 is first flight so it was rebranded the 717 aside from that boeing had no input in designing what became the 717 they tried selling it for a bit but it was competing against the 737 so they stopped selling it then finished up the order backlog and shut the production line down permanently  here is the  from the 100th anniversary celebration a while back  also missing the 720 must have been grounded p boeings commercial jets and boeings adopted child of a jet   717 it is a mcdonnell douglas design  i kind of hate that they ret conned the name on it into 717  for whatever reason this was the first time boeing did a photo op of all of their models lined up like that  they do not even do a mass formation of in production aircraft like airbus did  i have flown 5 of those airplanes well i was plumber on the 727 but still i am old   gt plumber hey do not sell flight engineers short  impressive i was going to say i have flown on all but one of these but your story is hella cooler  bruh i have been on 2    that is dope asf hoooly no ones gonna say that the 747 is no 2 engine is larger than the others could be rolls royce or ge is test bed  that is what i am thinking because the diameter appears to be the same as the 777 engines ge is airplane may have been available for a staged shot or this may have just been random happenstance on a taxiway  is not your left nut larger than your right it is the same with aircrafts  gt s is not 717 is an updated version of dc 9 md 80 i am asking seriously  md95 re badged  thank you  pretty much and to add some more detail the broader dc 9 family went through three or four generations depending on how you count it there was the original dc 9 family built in the 1960s and 1970s the md 80 family with various upgrades built in the 1980s and 1990s and the md 90 amp b717 with larger more modern engines the 717 was originally supposed to be the md 95 generally as a shrink version of the md 90 but with slightly different engines and other minor upgrades one can debate whether they are ultimately the same generation or not the md 90 was built 1993 2000 and the 717 was built 1998 2006 only the b717 got rebranded as a boeing because the md 90 production was well underway by the time mcdonnell douglas became a part of boeing but the md 95 b717 had not yet entered service so boeing rebranded that one the fact that the broader dc 9 family went through so many major name changes while the 737 family did not is simply a product of how their builders marketed their planes with mcdonnell douglas renaming it each time while boeing kept using the same number even though we are now on the 4th generation of 737 but essentially the dc 9 md 80 md 90 and 717 are all just variants of the same plane  each line still uses the original type cert too for this reason i still call the 717 a dc 9  i agree it is interesting how the name changes made the flying public treat each version as a separate plane it was notable at delta over the past 10 years when they retired the dc 9 then the md 80 amp md 90 however it was barely noted when they retired the 737 200 and 737 300 since they already had the 737 800 but if you ask me the dc 9 era at delta will not truly end until they retire the 717  thank you  yes thank you  here are some photos that also include the 787 from the 2016 100th anniversary lineup amp x200b  amp x200b fun fact the boeing 727 used in this lineup n7001u was the prototype 727 and the first 727 ever built   gt fun fact the boeing 727 used in this lineup n7001u was the prototype 727 and the first 727 ever built the prototype and the first one built that is crazy  looks like a dc 3 parked off to the side it is interesting to see it is size compared to the 747  sort of it is actually their dc 2 formerly kept flyable by the douglas historical foundation  looks like n747ge in the middle  that is what i thought too but n747ge does not has a solid dark vertical tail edit the link posted here confirms its rolls n787rr flying test bed it also has a massive engine compared to the other 3  can anyone break down the numerical nomenclature for me what does each of the 3 numbers distinguish for each model were the models just named in sequence of when they were built makes sense if that is the case  the middle number represents the order the planes were introduced except the 717 which is much newer and was developed by mcdonnell douglas prior to their merger with boeing in 1997 of the planes in the picture only the 737 747 767 and 777 are still in production though the current 737 737 max is quite a bit differ from the original 737 additionally the 747 is being retired in 2022 and all remaining production is for the cargo variant the 787 was introduced after this picture was taken and is also still in production boeing has begun early development of their next model which is widely assumed to carry the name 797 and is expected to replace the 767 in the lineup  i thought the 797 was going to be more like the 757 in terms of size  isnt the 757 just a taller 737 with better range or am i mistaken  sort of in practice but the 757 was developed to replace the 727  the original 717 was the other 387 80 descendant besides the 707 the c 135 kc 135 so technically boeing did name them in proper order this picture is just wrong  what do the outer numbers 7 mean they could have just named them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 the 7 is mean nothing it is just their shtick  the 707 would of been the first of boeing 700 model series everything up to 500 were other aircraft types 600 was reserved for space vehicles and missiles  i went to the boeing factory in washington and the tour guide said that the last 7 was because of james bond and some promotion with 007 might be total bs afaik  pretty sure the guy who came up with the naming just liked the sound of 7x7 pure marketing  can not say it does not work tho  is it just me or did everyone see that the 747 has one oversized engine  do not mention it it is very self conscious about it  yeah i saw that right away i would guess its a test bed 747 used to test different engines in flight  it looks like a 777 engine testbed compare the size and look of them  dream lifter the cargo plane sitting in the background crying dreamlifter is technically a 747 so it can stay there lol you gotta feel for the passengers stuck back there in the 777 they are gonna be waiting for a while i am saving this that is a nice comparison pic  holy cow thank you for bringing this to my attention  can someone photoshop a 787 in there at the back    the original 717 was boeing is internal reference for the kc135 rather than that dire md kite  the 777 airframe is the pinnacle of metallic fuselage aircraft design changemymind generally a cool pic does anyone know the naming convention used for the 700 series i have been wondering for years lol  it refers to the order in which they were developed ignore the 717 in the photo the real 717 would be the kc 135  what is coming after the 797  7107 i guess can not they just redesign an existing airline model or can not we go back to the days when airliners had actual names like constellation or electra you would think they would learn a little from the auto industry  the boeing xts a new definition of luxury check out one of these incredible offers at your local boeing dealer well qualified lessees can get dollar5 000 purchase cash on a new dollar300 000 000 plane hurry before they are all gone  thinking of buying airbus e class check out boeing ct5 it has more standard equipment better fuel economy and costs 25 million less  oh great another christmas commercial never realized how big the 707 was  with a hidden easter egg  did the 707 use turbojets or low bypass turbofan the cowl diameter looks more b 52 than typical airliners the first models used the jt3c turbojets they upgraded to turbofans in 1960  it is almost counterintuitive how jet engines keep getting larger yet relatively quieter and more efficient i had the pleasure of seeing one of the 747 air force one jets take off from a relatively close distance the thing that struck me was how oddly quiet it was compared to much smaller jets that took off earlier and later that day  short answer yes detailed answer the different versions have different engine types 707 120 and 320 hadpratt and whitney jt3c turbojets 707 220 pratt and whitney jt4a turbojets 707 420 had rolls royce conway turbofans 707 120b 320b and 320c had pratt and whitney jt3d turbofans some military versions and the unsold civil 707 720 have cfm56 high bypass turbofans and there is a very few other re engined out there with pratt and whitney jt8d turbofans  when you realize it is a real picture must have been amazing seeing them all lined up in person like that is the beluga waiting for clearance to taxi  what did you just call the dreamlifter   i figured if it was the dreamlifter it would be in the lineup it is just a variation of the 747 just like their are multiple variants of the other jets    are the first 3 even still flying  there are still a hundred ish 717s in commercial service most of them are flying with delta qantaslink and hawaiian each have a few as well  i get why they are doing it but i will miss the 717 especially if the substitute happens to be an rj the a220 is a very solid substitute however  yeah the thought of more rjs does not make me happy indianapolis is my home airport and the loss of the md80 family from delta is fleet probably means more rjs in the short term  there might be some 707s running cargo somewhere in the world but i would be surprised they were old in the 1980s  only 707s still flying are military variants  707 you can not book tickets on anymore military government and a very few private ones still 717 still at delta hawaiian and qantas 727 yes still a few out there but passenger ones are rare now  i do not consider the 717 a real boeing though  i am annoyed by the 717 in this pic and commercial aviation on general there was already a 717 before boeing renamed a dc 9 derivative for those that do not know the kc 135 has a manufacturer model number of 717  it bothers me these are not in order by size you can tell that 747 is a engine test plane that number 2 engine is huge  i sometimes forget how big the 777 is it is basically the 747 successor minus the clout  i did not realize how big the 707 was my dad was a flight engineer on the 707 and then the first 747 qantas still proud  707 looks like what a jet aircraft should such a pretty aircraft right proportions  the 747 is huge that 747 is still a boss hey my favorite part is the dream lifter in the back corner  there is 1 impostor among us what is the deal with the one swollen engine on the 747  is the 707 the biggest in capacity  no not even close in max density the seating capacity was around 170 i think  thank you i do not know why i am downvoted i was just asking a question ooh so close  nobody noticed the dreamlifter in the background  we just have to wait for 797 one engine on the right side of the 747 looks waaaay bigger than the other 3 it got stung by a bee  test engine  note that four of these aircraft 707 727 737 747 were introduced within a 12 year timespan 1958 1970 but it took seven years to design and deliver the 787 alone 2004 2011  other than the 787 apparently the only other numbered plane missing from the lineup is the boeing 720 which is a derivative of the 707  i do not know shit about planes so can someone eli5 why the nomenclature does not match up with the plane size  really hope i could fly on the 707 and 727 again these beauties are just pure gold lt 3 777x tho be my fav only one of those has done a loop  is not the 717 adopted like the a220  more like hated stepchild  who snuck a mcdonnell douglass in there  am i crazy or is the 747 is 2nd engine larger then the other three   bigger planes are not the blown up version of smaller planes there are concerns regarding structural aerodynamic material  yeah what if the shape works really well  while the beluga whale in the background upper right very corner screaming fat shaming not fair  why is that one engine on the 747 so much larger is it like a test plane or something for engines   dreamliner did not get the memo  not much of a comparison when it is all in perspective  1 the 717 has surprisingly large engines 2 is that the ge test bed 747 with the giant no 2 engine 3 really helps put into perspective how big the 777 is engines are and it is easier to see how they really are similar in size to the 737 is fuselage 3 and for those who did not notice there is even the dreamlifter in the background upper right 717 has no business being there fight me  i did not think the 707 was that big hey idk if anyone pointed it out yet but the 747 appears to be an engine testbed as the left inboard engine is significan notly larger than the rest  oh i would love the 727 to come to msfs 2020 for a nice cargo jet i still love the 707 it was very classic and very beautiful  and i was in that tent wearing the ugliest baby blu tux with ruffles the boeing swing band was the entertainment for the evening but the real entertainment was watching all the suits with their trophy babes later the crowd assembled on the runway standing on markings spelling out the latest boeing plane  a gig i will never forget that and my pals superb sax solo get that 717 out of there  for whatever reason i always forget about the 767  i though the 757 was a failure  nope the flying pencil is a fantastic aircraft  it did not sell as well as boeing was hoping but it is a hell of an aircraft  looks like a

exploded engine the 707 is huge  the 707 usually had a 3 2 configuration but here its width looks comparable to the wide bodies  is there a similar picture for airbus  which of these is testing an engine update  707 will always remain in my heart i did not know that the 717 is that small they are gonna get some bad wake turbulence taking off like that   as i get on the 707 riding high i got tears in my eye  this might be a stupid question but why did they start at 707  the common story is it was going to be 700 707 sounded luckier however several boeing prop airliners also ended in 7 247 307 377 so the pattern was established already  so cool and very interesting i have always been curious about that  707 is such a handsome boi and the only plane there to have done a complete barrel roll norice inboard engine on left wing  damn some of those shots you realize how large the 787 10 is compared to it is little bro  screenshot from the source video linked by u majorcharliefoxtrot  i am surprised that it only carries 100 more passengers  more and nicer first class seats a few airlines have crammed 440 passengers on an a330 300 which is smaller than 787 10 its a matter of seating density in typical use yeah international first class seats etc take up a heck of a lot more space than domestic first class if you scaled up a typical 737 cabin to fit the 787 it would hold a lot more than 100 extra people  i beg your pardon your big brother is the one born first whether he is bigger than you or not one thing i see that i find pretty interesting is that notwithstanding that these are two airplanes of very different sizes equal bank angles seem to produce equal turn rates how they do that  turn rate is a factor of speed and bank angle not size since the two are traveling at the same speed and banking at the same angle they turn at the same rate  thanks i am actually not certain that is true i have a physics education and some flight experience and i thought about if for a long time before i put the comment out there the only answer that satisfied me in my own mind is one that depends on both aircraft having the same lift to weight relationship which in my thinking would be more happenstance than anything else if your answer is the end of it then it would follow that a f 16 and an a380 would turn at the same rate so long as they set up in the same bank angle at the same speed would they i do not know and now i would like to hear from someone with aircraft engineering expertise to settle the question  good thing i am an aerospace engineering student as it happens they would  can you direct me to some reference which supports that conclusion or explain why it is true it is highly counter intuitive to me  see the phak page 5 22 and 5 23 the short version is that a turn is caused by in imbalanced horizontal force this horizontal force is the horizontal component of lift imagine for a moment you are actually spinning the airplane on a long string it is constantly turning and also staying aloft you can feel it tugging on your hands as it turns and you know that if you let go it will fly away from you this tugging is the horizontal component of lift that must be provided to turn in a real airplane you also need that force now rate and radius of turn of a rotating object are normally impacted by mass as well however so is the vertical component of lift it must equal mass times gravity by the law of similar triangles the mass cancels out by that same logic the rate and radius of turn are no longer impacted by the mass that leaves only two variables the velocity and bank angle any other questions feel free to ask  i do understand force vector math i will use an extreme example what if you decreased the wing surface of an a380 so much that it would provide barely enough lift to get the plane airborne in that case at any given airspeed the lateral force vector produced at any given bank angle would be less than it would be if the wing produced greater lift with a lesser lateral force component how could the modified aircraft turn at the same rate as the unmodified aircraft assuming same weight and airspeed this is what i do not understand  with the wing producing barely the lift needed to get it airborne even a slight bank would lead to a stall unless you increased the airspeed the wing generates more lift in a bank since now it has to both turn the airplane and keep it up it might help if you know the equations for both lift and turn rate lift 0 5 coefficient of lift density of air airspeed 2 surface area of wing rate of turn airspeed 2 11 26 tan bank angle the rate of turn assumes the wing can provide the lift necessary be it through a large coefficient of lift depends on wing design higher airspeed or larger wings  i was waiting for someone to pull out the equation this is intro to aero level stuff not quite rocket science  i do not see how this establishes that any two aircraft with sufficient wing area to maintain lift through a turn will turn at an equal rate if airspeed and the bank angle of the wings are both equal  there is honestly not much else i can say besides to draw out the free body diagram and see for yourself  ok thanks depends on when you woudl claim the aircraft was born 787 10 program commencement was after 737 max but discussions and exploratory phase was a couple years before that just the 8 delays caused it to start much later or if you mean eis than the 10 still is not born  wait nvm just realized that is a max 9 it is the little brother in all regards i believe  well i mean the 737 has been around a lot longer than the 787  that was my thinking  then  i can imagine david attenborough narrating this something like the child stays close the parent as he is an easy target for predators  so would the predator be an a380  a380 is are filter feeders feeding off of huge amounts of small economy passengers a single a380 can consume up to 800 economy passengers in a single feeding the 787 is protecting the young 737 is from being preyed upon by 777 is which will eat pretty much anything occasionally you will see a lone 737 or even a 757 taken down by a flock of a320f aircraft but since they are pretty much impossible to get parts for they tend to cannabalize one another as opposed to going after isolated boeing aircraft  say more things 777s adapted this omnivorous lifestyle in response to the dramatic decrease in the population of their favourite prey the a340  but every once in a while the a340 still gets a moment to laugh in the 777s face when it can do something the 777 can not like fly non stop from sxm cdg  why can not the 777 fly that route non stop  it probably can if the winds happen to be right to take off over the water but taking off the other direction far more common there is a big ass mountain right off the end of the not very long just over 7500 ft runway  so a lot of planes do not have the engine out performance to take off with a full load of passengers and enough fuel for a transatlantic crossing  afaik air france is the only airline to fly from sxm to europe without making a stop somewhere nearby to pick up more fuel on an island with a longer runway and no mountain they have only done it with the a340 300  747s classics and 400s as well as 777s from various carriers all make a stop on the way back as they can not manage the trip non stop they can all get from europe to sxm non stop though  for some reason i never considered the airport itself i was stuck thinking why a 777 could not make a 6700km flight thanks for explaining that what is could air france is plan be for when their current a340 is retire will they have to stop with non stop flights   gt what is could air france is plan be for when their current a340 is retire will they have to stop with non stop flights quite possibly being that nobody else offers an sxm europe non stop it is not a huge issue to stop on another island for fuel on the way out  definitely lends credence to calling the airbus transport the beluga xl when you imagine them as a whale eating a whole pile of plankton  i mean sure a beluga does not really eat plankton but there are not many choices when trying to relate an airplane with a cetacean  i thought  one was the beluga it is the one that eat is small medium sized narrow bodies it would make more sense for that to be a non filter feeder cetacean  that is beautiful  if i could upvote you 20 times i would  i do not know why you are being down voted so here is a down vote  he

care about it is that only a problem for small planes i see this clip and can only think about the private jet incident from january vortices move rearward and down while also getting larger so i would assume by staying close and just above the 787s wingtips which it does in the gif the 737 is able to stay clear of them  oh i see thanks  and ironically it is the 737 that needs weird wingtips to stay within airport gate boxes  you may be thinking of 777x 737 has split winglets that is a thoughtful design feature incorporated to ultimately reduce induced drag on maneuver conditions fwik it has nothing to do with airport sizing constraints but i could be wrong gorgeous jet though edit sp the 737 max would get p 8 poseidon wings if they did not need to fit in the same size gate boxes  the

via wikipedia seems to be sourced reliably from aviation week  gt the configuration is designed to maximize lift for a wingspan restricted to the same category c sized gates as current 737s the design traces its origins to the split wingtip adopted for similar gate restraint reasons for the proposed but never built md 12 twin deck concept devised by mcdonnell douglas in the 1990s before it merged with boeing the span considerations of the md 12 determined that it had to live within the 213 foot span of the 747 400 says boeing flight sciences chief aerodynamicist and former douglas designer robert gregg inboard of the winglet and outboard of the aileron the max will also incorporate a divergent trailing edge this puts more load into winglet and makes it work harder he adds  that sounds more like it was not to fit the aircraft in the gate but more so just make the aircraft perform better with a shorter than maybe ideal wingspan it says that it was already restricted to those gates they knew what they had to work with no  well we read the same thing i do not agree but i do not know enough to disagree with you either  aero engineer here the 737 has been around since the late 60 is and is widely used around the world so a ton of airport infrastructure has been designed to accomodate planes of that size the goal of the 737 ng and max programs were to improve upon the aerodynamics and performance of that proven design so it was not a question of how do we make this plane fit into a c size gate it was what is the best way to improve the efficiency of this wing without significan notly increasing its span  long slender raked tips like the 787 would be ideal but since they were constrained by gate size they went with the split scimitar tips   boeing 737 max aerodynamic improvements the split tip wingtip device is designed to maximize lift while staying in the same icao aerodrome reference code letter c gates as current 737s it traces its design to the mcdonnell douglas md 12 1990s twin deck concept proposed for similar gate restrictions before the boeing merger it should deliver at least 1 5percent improvements in fuel economy or even more if the proposed laminar flow surface treatment meets expectations       downvote to remove  v0 22 good bot the scimitar winglets are much lower than a wide body is wing tips so they have to fit within the confinement lines to accommodate other planes in adjacent gates  perhaps because it is usually flying into smaller airports with closer interval gates  precisely   goose get this bogey off my ass  i know it is not but does it look animated to anyone else  the very last shot does think it is a combination of the background barely moving and practically no reflections on the body  i still think this is a flight simulator so much of it looked just slightly off it is not no flight sim is that good these planes just rarely fly like that because passengers would hate it  i would be having a blast  most people would puke  and this one was pretty tame compared to what boeing has filmed in moses lake in the past  from what i heard they backed off a bit for this demonstration due to both of the planes not being far enough along in the flight test program  holy hell this is close to erotic to me is the 737 the max 9 or the brand new max 10  another commenter linked the youtube video boeings youtube page these clips came from the title lists it as the max 9  the max 10 only exists on paper for now it has not finished being engineered yet much less built or flown  here we see a

this is amazing   the 787 wings are just so beautiful goddamn the 787 is a beauty to behold non pilot here with an innocent question what are the risks involved flying this close in general i assume these pilots are highly trained so there is no real danger    zero  and those are just two lonely planes what about the formation flight with five a350  zero just file your plan as flight of two in us or canada or two separate plans to a practice area  amazing and also terrifying seeing that pop out of nowhere   tenerife ptsd intensifies  going to tenerife in less than a month now you have scared me great job i am going to tenerife in less than a month too 6th september although it is to tenerife south and not north tenerife buddies  south too 2nd sep until 9th  i will be in costa adeje playa de las americas while i am there  nice i will be at hotel aguamarina golf  not too far from the airport then looks like a really nice place  definetely i am a plane spotter so it is a good spot for me  lucky i really want to get into planespotting  international flights now all go from tfs that airport was being constructed when the 1977 disaster happened it had long been known that norte airport was trouble both for weather and for being unable to handle the projected increase in tourism tenerife soon became starting in the early 1980s a huge favourite for the uk package holiday market a position it still holds tfn is mainly for inter island mainland spain and moroccan services  i was going to say just do not fly klm but i assume they learned their lesson  a couple of weeks ago when i was leaving sfo the pilot went full throttle as we were taxiing onto the runway as we were turning he hit the breaks super hard and then apologized that air traffic control said we were cleared for takeoff but then they quickly retracted a second later i see a 767 rumbling down the runway for takeoff  if it is landing would not it be coming out of the non foggy bit p unless you are sitting in the foggy bit  almost out of this world  i am getting vibes of that scene from rebooted star trek where the enterprise rises through the clouds on titan  oh man i loved that scene this gets lower quality every time it is posted but i love it more every time it is posted note for next month is poster  was this your shot  no unfortunately but if it is going to be reposted once a month i want people to have the source and the highest quality version  fair enough thanks    it is like the 787 is looking up to the queen and the queen is show how it is done to the young buck  in british accent now pay attention young man or you will end up like those ryanair fools  american carriers    laughs in 4 rolls royce rb211s   though many think of the 787 as some of the most voracious wide bodied aircraft in the sky even they make way for the truly remarkable size of the 747 here we see the curious interaction between a 787 and 747 400 like two ships passing in the night the 747 is much to large for the 787 to think about taking on its own however the 747 400 is have never been known to go after other aircraft at all instead preferring to subsist on a large number of small passengers or medium size cargo  so a little bit of info on the apparent size of the jets here because it is a telephoto lens it flattens the image in a way that makes objects thousands of feet away from each other relatively to scale with each other so in this picture the 747 is potentially a mile away on an adjacent runway but appears huge in comparison in reality it is only slightly smaller than it would appear if they were right next to each other for shots like these the windows and doors are a good guide although the 787 has slightly bigger windows most jets are nearly similar sizes with their windows and doors here the you can see the 747 is doors are nearly the same size so this is close to what the planes would look like next to each other to the human eye also to keep in mind is the angle of the jets the 787 is at a significan notly sharper angle away from the camera is z axis which diminishes it is apparent size  this is sfo those runways are right next to each other  maybe depends on which sfo runways considering how high up the 47 is probably not  this is shot from bayfront park which would make this a photo of the 747 landing on 28l or r and the 787 taxiing on foxtrot from this angle the 787 is probably about 1 0 miles from the camera and the 747 is either 1 1 miles or 1 4 miles from the camera here is  from the same spot showing a 747 on 28r and a 737 landing on 28l  thanks for clearing it up i assumed they were on opposite runways and pretty far apart considering the positions of the planes   david attenborough voice 787 is mind and if i was a british 747

in awe  not over it is like that scene where mufasa appears in the sky   remember who you are simba  the flying dutchman bruuuhh that looks so fucking majestic is this the boss level  i thought you needed to pay for porn like this  just my 2 cents ba is not landing over anyone the ua 787 is on taxiway foxtrot which is off to the right of the 28s otherworldy  wow stunning looks like okinawa  it is ksfo oh fuck oh yes daddy what is in the nose of that thing a private cabin  sydney right are we sure this picture is legit the 747 and 787 are roughly similar sized planes the 747 appears significan notly larger in the picture indicating that it must be closer to the camera the fog obscuring the 747 but not the 787 and the apparent front wheel of the 747 behind the tail of the 787 make it clear that the 747 is in the background seems like it has to be fake i am probably wrong though  the 787 is not parallel to the camera and it is therefore dramatically foreshortened making the 787 look smaller also they are likely fairly close to one another i think the 787 is at the hold short line on taxiway f while the 747 is landing on 28l  the 74 and 78 are not really similar in size lol a large zoom lens car really disturb size of foreground and background exactly this shot was taken a long ways from either plane  just like in sports it looks like all runners are parallel on the track but are actually ways apart it is real  might be that i found it on facebook and tough it was cool so i shared it but know as much as you do  wait it is larger inside than a 747  the 777 9 has a total length of 251 feet 9 inches 76 72 meters the 747 8 is just a bit smaller at 250 feet 2 inches 76 3 meters  what about the a 380  a380 is larger in volume but shorter than both i call it the chode of the sky a380 is 73m long shorter than both siri says that 73 metres is equal to 239 foots and 6 wenches for you imperial folk  for americans that is about two thirds of a football field  what is that in bananas  six foot seven foot eight foot bunch  daylight come and me wanna go home  excuse my charisma for mit grads that is 42 896 smoots  a 380 is 4 metres shorter than the 777 9 would you look at

the fuselage not the wingspan and outer length i am gonna google it but how is this longer than an a340 600 edit that is crazy it is  and people seem to be missing that you said in production  no longer producing the 747 as of last year exactly the title reads in production  it is however also slightly longer and wider than the last 747 variant longest and widest in production which the 747 no longer is  it says in production  if they folded the tips just a little more they could make it carrier capable maybe it could carry a carrier if it grips it by the husk  it is not a question of where he grips it it is a simple question of weight ratios a 178 tonne bird could not carry a 100 000 tonne ship  what of it was an african 777  non migratory so it is a bit of a moot point  are you suggesting airplanes migrate  wait a minute suppose if two 777 9 is carried it together  what held under the dorsal guiding wings  i knew somebody would have the same thought as me 777 9 cv haha c 777 or kc 777 there is no specific naval designations in use anymore  ah thanks for clarifying anyway  cvn 777 interior looks a bit rough but i like the entertainment systems for the passengers  finally i can play a flight sim inside a real plane  connect the sim to the cockpit as backup and let passengers turns to do an irl landing s everyone who wants to can fly and then the plane just averages out their inputs  who needs pilots anymore when you could crowdsource wow imagine just how little skill and education all those people have to work at boeing  just average and remove the extreme outliers so no one can just turn the whole plane into the ground ok everyone yoke full lock forward now now now  twitch plays long haul pilot do it ender is game style and do not tell them it is real life not a flight sim leg room does not seem too bad either  just wait until its ryanairified standing room only lol lots of room for activities no power tools  yeah the gaming cafe is a great addition to any plane tbh first class pods do not look comfortable at all even has kegs in the rear  outfits like emirates can not wait to get their hands on this i am sure  with the amount they have on order i would be seeing them like house flies they order heavy twins like we buy candy tomorrow they will say it is not big enough and could boeing make it longer and also make a 777neo and hurry up or they will go to airbus  well they ordered quad engine double deckers like candy as well  due to their location on the planet they can make whale work for them and it does dxb is the perfect midpoint no us airline was interested if i recall  yeah the a380 really was not an option for us carriers that have like 5 or 6 different hubs as opposed to one or two still nuts to think that half of the a380s went to emirates though  there are 123 emirates a380s out of 251 made  good bot  thanks  even better bot  they kept the programs head above water for sure they were even pushing for a neo version iirc airbus at one time was debating a version with blended winglets   gt they order heavy twins like we buy candy gt gt tomorrow they will say it is not big enough and could boeing make it longer and also make a 777neo and hurry up or they will go to airbus hey ge you know those engines you are having trouble supplying us yeah we want a new one  hahahahaha noob question but why was the a380 largely a commercial failure given its size and failed hub and spoke model but this big boy a success is there a magic sweat spot not requiering specific changes at airports  one important difference is that the 777x is a twinjet that consumes much less fuel than the quadjet a380  this is based on a limited understanding but is it correct to generalize that a larger radius jet engine is more fuel efficient than two smaller ones making the same combined thrust  yep it is all about the bypass air  i have never really been able to get my head around this i know it is true but i can not intuitively understand why a jet engine pulls in air compresses it in multiple stages then adds fuel and ignites it which creates an explosion forcing rotation of the engine core which keeps the engine spinning and the cabin pressurised it then throws that exhaust out the back through a propelling nozzle that creates the thrust without the nozzle all you have is a gas turbine generator but then if you oversize the outer fan blades and put a shroud around that you end up sucking air around the outside of the turbine bypassing it which then gets thrown out the back also providing thrust what i get hung up on is that thrust is the reactive force to throwing mass in a direction if you throw a ball there is a small reactive force that pushes you in the opposite direction or if you throw a ton of air out the back of a jet engine there is an opposing and equal force acting on the engine to propel it forward but the thrust coming from the engine core has more pressure temperature and i would think velocity than air that has just gone through a literal fan and has not been ignited or compressed so how does a high bypass engine improve efficiency what am i missing  ignore the cowling for a second and what do you have an enormous propeller a bigger propeller moves more air at a given rotational rate than a smaller propeller so for the same fuel burn you move more air ge and others are looking at just such a concept called a propfan because they are very efficient  that the compressor generates thrust is cool because you get to add it to the thrust being produced by the fan blades but the bigger fan equals greater air movement would be true even for an electrically powered fan so you want the biggest fan you can get under the wings because if i am already doing the combustion i might as well move as much air with it as i can since i can get more thrust for the equivalent fuel burn it is not free thrust because you get mechanical losses and drag penalties and such but it is far more efficient than just using all that additional air to burn fuel e grammar got it thanks but this begs the question of why the original jet engines had no bypass  complexity they were struggling to make the basic concept of jet engines working consistently and reliably in the early days without throwing in the additional design considerations for bypass once the turbojet design matured enough then engineers began to look at ways to improve efficiency which resulted in bypass of the turbofan  is not the materials science that goes into the blades within the engine just bonkers  like without these innovations we would be stuck back in the smokey jet engines of the early days  if you were to make the whole engine shroud a compressor then you would also drastically increase the weight and fuel consumption of the engine but would not really increase the rpm of the engine which is determined by the exhaust gasses driving a fan at the exit of the engine which in turn drives the shaft of the engine  since you have this shaft at a given rpm you might as well try to move some extra air by adding extra fan blades as there is only a minor drag torque penalty for doing so so for the same amount of fuel burnt you now can move way more air and this have a more efficient engine mass they bypass move a larger amount of air mass your conceptual understanding relies on thinking that more pressure and speed will produce more thrust but that is only true when comparing the same area the bypass has a much larger area than the core and moves much more air mass  okay right but why would not you just make the engine bigger and send all of that air through the core  what is the advantage of only using some of the air to spin the engine  the core is not efficient but produces lots of excess torque using the torque to drive the bypass converts the fuel energy into thrust without letting the excess torque go to waste  that is an interesting way to look at it thanks  it is less efficient to produce thrust by ducting air through the core engine compared to bypassing air around it  there are many reasons to not make an engine bigger a few big ones being you run into problems with ground clearance it is more difficult and expensive to produce and there is an inherent limit in how big an engine can get as fan size increases so does the blade tip speed and if the blade tip speed starts approaching the supersonic region all kinds of shit starts to happen  it is better to exhaust a lot of air mass with a slight velocity increase than a small amount of air mass with a high velocity increase both might lead to the same thrust force but in the latter case you have a lot of kinetic energy in the exhaust air which is a complete waste it is related to the fact that the kinetic energy of the exhaust air is proportional to mv while the thrust is only proportional to mv  the limited way i think about it is that the pure turbojets used to have a ton of excess noise and heat driving the bypass fan is a way to push that energy i to momentum fuel and also simple economics the engine core is much more complex with its multiple compressor stages and complicated cooling systems scaling all that up means much more expensive engines you also need fuel to turn that much bigger engine core and also to have stable combustion as you can not just run everything super lean in essence large bypass engines are almost turboprops just with a cowling around it  force is from change of momentum f ma m v t to get that v you use energy as per kinetic energy 1 2 m v 2 so as the v goes higher more energy is required per thrust e f v so efficiency is 1 v  i e it is more efficient to do less acceleration on more air this is only limited by physical constraints and the extra weight cost of larger fans  the amount of air being moved by the high bypass fan is astounding the thrust from the gas turbine is used to drive the fan in an axial configuration a non axial configuration like a turbo prop plane or a turbine helicopter use the thrust from the turbine to drive another fan connected to an output shaft that drives the propeller  huh i had never thought of the rotor blades of a helicopter as being like a very high bypass engine without a cowling  but now i see the usefulness in logically separating the fan function from the engine function even when like in a plane both are mounted on the same shaft their explanations are okay but to focus on the physics yes bypass ratio is important but you can have the same ratio in different engine sizes the reason larger diameter fans are still more efficient is because of drag drag is pcav 2 so 2x speed is 4x drag a larger fan can push the same amount of air at a slower rpm which has exponential consequences on drag it has more surface area for engine cooling and the fan air is further from the hot core colder fan air is more dense which means more mass which means more thrust there is also an engine weight difference efficiency in use of the materials that i am too lazy to get into as you increase engine size less material per horsepower is needed certainly a lower part count than doubling number of engines instead but basically all the answers go back to the basic geometry of the engine diameter volume surface area fan speed bypass ratio  a lot of people have given you good answers but to try to understand it intuitively i think that for a second we should forget how the engine works and just think about the thermodynamics of it because in a way you are actually thinking about it backwards imagine for a second that the engine is just a black box that burns fuel and exhausts air if you burn an amount of fuel and then exhaust hot high pressure gas out the back of our engine you are throwing overboard a lot of potentially useful energy that has not been converted into forward motion in fact the ideal would be to exhaust gas that is at ambient temperature and pressure then you would have extracted all usable energy from the fuel you burned pressure is fairly easy to deal with it is really just a function of the geometry of your exhaust nozzle in most high performance turbojets and rocket engines exhaust pressure is designed to be around ambient pressure at the cruising altitude you can tell this by observing the  that form when they are run near sea level even from a very powerful engine the exhaust is actually being squeezed down by the atmosphere because its static pressure is less than one atmosphere at the point of exit but if the exhaust gas is still hotter than ambient temperature you are again wasting energy so one way to think about a high bypass turbofan is that it is actually a way to decrease the average temperature of your exhaust gas which makes you more efficient  the jet engine makes plenty more power than it needs to keep spinning so you can attach more blades to it and push more air while simultaneously helping keep the core cooler so it can make even more power i remember reading once that jet engines are limited on efficiency by the materials they are made of if we could make something strong and heat resistant enough we could make some really amazing thrust and efficiency but we can not so bypass air is the next best thing but there is a lot more to it than what i just said  in general bigger engines are more efficient then smaller engines you will see the same in everything from cargo ships to power generation  think of the bypass fan portion of a turbofan as a big propeller and the rest of the turbine hot core part as mostly just an engine that turns the propeller fan area increases exponentially as diameter increases but the fuel burn required to turn the bigger fan is not thus a bigger bypass fan is more efficient than a smaller one for a given amount of fuel used  ahhh okay yes so in terms of fuel per unit of thrust it is more efficient to drive a big fan but there must be a limit on how big your fan can be current designs already have supersonic blade tips so if you went even bigger that would become limiting perhaps  that is why engine manufacturers are now developing turbofans with reduction gears between the fan and the core  plus half the maintenance for engines which i think would cost a lot given the complexity the a380 is a much larger plane really its slightly shorter but its heavier has a larger wingspan and is taller max passengers on this is 414 vs a theoretical max of 853 for the a380 that means there are actually relatively few airports the a380 can use its a code f vs e for the 777x that limits routes and therefore flexibility the airports and gates the a380 can use are also more expensive the main issue though is fuel efficiency the 4 engine design of the a380 dates from pre 2000 fuel prices where this was not a huge issue in the current climate the a380 is very expensive to run and needs to be basically full all the time to turn a profit this means only a few routes like london to dubai are worthwhile as finding 800 passengers for other routes is not guaranteed the 777x has more efficient engines and the 2 engine design is naturally more efficient less maintance intensive and does not have disadvantages for safety all in the a380 is just too niche this plan will be more versatile shame though the a380 is the most comfortable plane i have ever flown on  very informative comment so thank you but it still made me kinda sad i am weirdly obsessed w the a380 after flying 8 times every year dxb to lax and knowing that they will change it to this plane is kinda sad for me a380s are hella fun and comfortable but i guess not profitable wonder what emirates will do with their 100 a380s what is your frequent flyer status do they just hand you gold bullion  i am platinum now been flying that route a lot i remember united is highest miles customer got his name painted on a 747 scrapped i doubt they get turned to freighters i do not think the efficiency is good enough to make sense  it is unlikely the a380 will ever be cargo due to the 2nd floor being structural so it can not take big loads tee hee some airline are doubling down on them through i think i remember singapore looking for some more due to limited amount of slots so would fly 1 plane daily rather than 2 smaller aircraft on some routes  yes it is yet unclear that emirates is replacing the a380 with the 777x more likely they are replacing their older 777s emirates would buy more a380s if they could  emirates only would have bought more had airbus updated the a380 to a new version airbus was unwilling to do that because emirates was literally the only airline interested in it and they would not have recouped their investment  correct  the 4 engines also stem from the time when etops was limited to 3 hours which meant a lot of the transpacific and even transatlantic routes were off limits to twin engine aircraft big advances in engine tech and regulation relaxation to allow 7 hours diversion times has helped open up the routes so now it is limiting or removing the need of the 4 engine set up that is not entirely accurate the 350 1000 regularly goes with 240 mins of edto and the 777 300er regularly flies now with just 204 mins in fact pretty much everywhere can be done with just those edto requirements there is nowhere in the world where 7 hours is the distance to the closest usable alternate that i can think of i would guess and not a slight meant in any way that you do not do this for a living just guessing because it has not been called etops for a few years 180 etops when it was called that was more than enough for trans pacific and polar routes fyi   in production being the headline is operative caveat i first thought of the a380 too the big airbus was basically an improvement of a late 60s concept i suppose it a mix of bad luck national pride and institutional inertia that made airbus sink billions into a concept whose time had passed  it is just too massive for almost all airlines i would say only emirates has truly been able to harness it but even they are now looking ahead to replacing it with efficient heavy twins 1 it is inefficient compared to the newgen twins 2 it is heavy and only certain airports can handle it 3 it has 4 engines to take care of emirates has 119 a380s that is 476 engines 4 it is an inefficient cargo hauler due to its weight and unlike the 747 which has nose cargo door the 380 cannot match that loading efficiency it is just too heavy there is some intersting physics involved here see below to read more on my point 4 see here  it is however the quietest smoothest airliner i have been ridden on as a avgeek my only gripe with it are the windows you are not right up against them like on 777 for example and they feel tiny and far away  simplified answer the a380 is too big for 99 99percent of the routes out there and the industry as a whole has been moving away from vlas and towards smaller airplanes and more frequencies the 777ng is far from a success at this point i do not see it doing particularly well given how capable the 787 and a350 already are  barely any airports can cater for the a380 it is too big  hey co pilot we need you to push all the buttons when the camera is on you  he must have come from the b737  nice did sia buy any  they have 31 confirmed orders for her  for some reason oddly numbered orders like that bug me either round the order down to 30 or up to 35 i know economics and what not  buy why does it need folding wing tips  so it can fit in the gate at the airport airlines would be reluctant to use it if it meant they had pay the airport more to use larger gates    to fit in the same box dimensions as the original 777 when parked at the airport but the longer wing helps with better aerodynamics for flying  merciful threatening homeless agonizing fearless roll slimy erect rhythm aspiring this post was mass deleted and anonymized with   slaps wing think of all the chemtrails you can put in this baby  r chemtrailpilots that is just plane punny  they are water filled containers to mimic passenger weight and below the floor is where your bags and cargo go i work on planes  the water filled meatbags are in the back  the chen trails flat earth q etc conspiracies started because of dry internet sarcasm hear me out you know when you read a comment and it is incredibly ridiculous when actually thought through but on the surface it is like damn that dude is right and that person goes to the next and notices reads more and more overtime this imaginary person does not know the difference and convinces others likely as dim witted forever and ever so thanks to internet sarcasm we have terrorists who think hollywood is consuming babies for sport  is not this to simulate the weight of the passengers  what did you think the chemtrails were made of   chemtrails are people  detective thorn soylent green  taco farts  they are kidding i think  there should be conveyor belts for transporting passengers flight attendants will ride scooters or even suzuki hayabusas by the way i did some voluntary work repairing a sud caravelle there was no chem trail tank instead the septic tank could be dumped in flight you know earlier in this crazy world alcoholic beverages were free even in the wt class and now i know the reason seriously 777 is very beautiful aircraft  got tuctucs to serve drinks and food  booze is still free on major airlines in the cattle class  thus sas is not a major airline finnair is out of my budget but maybe they have vodka taps for every passenger  what are those tanks just weights i also did not think they would need a whole server room for testing haha those are water ballast tanks that are primarily used to change the planes center of gravity during testing  eli5 what causes the years of delay  the real answer to that question has so many answers you can not actually answer it in a simple reddit comment however to give you some idea of a project i worked on with honeywell this project involved wiring harnesses that is it it took almost 2 years to get the project out the door and to honeywell the end customer being fedex is probably starting to install the wiring harnesses now almost 3 years later many of the delays were paperwork delays there is so much red tape in aviation it is insane during the project we found many issues with honeywells engineering drawings and it can take months for honeywell to approve engineering changes now imagine this scaled up to the project size of an entire airplane  make sure plane fly good no crashy crashy like brother max the faa has revised their flight certification process and has made it really extensive and exhaustive boeing has to clear all that before it can bring it to service damn that is a well read 5 year old the answer has very little to do with the 737max despite what the person making fun of fatal crashes with 200 upvotes will tell you the faa is currently overhauling their aircraft certification process this means to certify a new plane it now takes a lot more than it previously did aircraft certified before this new timeline 787 10 737 9 e190 e2 a350 1000 have all had relatively quick certification times but aircraft certified after this time 777 9 737 7 10 e175 e2 a350f will be subject to these new harsher regulations and thus take a lot longer to certify you can expect delays for any new aircraft entering service in the next five years thanks to this new overhaul by the faa while of course the embarrassment of the us own boeing having some quality control and pr issues has really antagonised the faa the truth is that regulators frequently update aircraft certification requirements to ensure that new built aircraft are safer than the previous generation i would expect easa and many other regulators to follow the faa over the next few years with their own certification requirement updates based on the faa is new overhaul  the catalyst for this major overhaul was the issues with the max though so they are correct and i do not think they were making fun of a fatal crash we do not always have to discuss things with complete reverance just to make a point boeing cut corners put money ahead of safety lied to the pilots lied to the regulators lied to the passengers and the families of those who died i personally consider what the faa is doing too light because they should specifically do more to ensure that boeing is not killing people for profits again  what is the big red emergency stop button for at 1 20 engine shutdown fire occupant ejection seat fire pilot ejection seat  hope that engineer does not sneeze  engines bigger than the fuselage of a 737 whee it is pretty neat that they showed us the chemtrails distribution system in the middle of the video  i do not see what all of the fuss is about it does not look any bigger than the mauritania  why do the tips fold  so it can fit in the gate at the airport airlines would be reluctant to use it if it meant they had pay the airport more to use larger gates  because sometimes you want to get into a gate but you can not fit and it is because of just the tip  enough with that fucking effect  yeah the constant fast forwarding was horrible could barely watch  reminder how big the ge9x engines are  poor thing got stung by a bee  too bad qantas are idiots and will never get a 777 ever oddly enough they were one of the carriers originally involved in the 777 design study and the only one to not order the aircraft  i thought this was flight sim 2020  in before those tips start folding in the air because of some unsolved software issues iirc the 777x can still fly along just fine with the wing tips folded it is just not as efficient flight wise as having them unfolded compared to carrier aircraft only a tiny portion of the 777x wing folds  but what if it gets stuck with one wingtip folded and the other unfolded  it will still be fine just a slight asymmetry in lift that might require minor corrections the vast majority of lift on a wing is generated close to the wing root  the faa and boeing has dozens of people whose main job is proposing and figuring out these kinds of scenarios remember if they aircraft turns out to be unsafe later on boeing has to develop and implement a fix anyways so they do their best to get it right on the first go   gt the faa and boeing has dozens of people whose main job is proposing and figuring out these kinds of scenarios clearly mcas was the rare exception the one oversight that threaded the multiple layers of swiss cheese safety evaluations gt boeing has to develop and implement a fix anyways all it took for boeing to finally implemented the fix was 346 human lives across 2 flights and almost 2 years of grounding by the faa heck i am not even sure if boeing admitted that mcas having that much trim control being controlled by a single aoa sensor was a safe design allowed to fly but hey hindsight 20 20 maybe i should stop being an ass at the money pinching bean counters execs whose profit over safety culture led to this unforeseeable incident they clearly deserved their bonuses and golden parachutes 346 lives is after all a small price to pay for a piss poor attempt to maintain type rating across a almost 60 year old air frame  all that said the folding wingtips on the 777x is probably a no biggie even if it malfunctioned in flight given how much boeing is being scrutinised on safety now i just hope boeing does not prove us wrong with more incidents i am just ranting cause your enormous faith in boeing safety culture boggles my mind like you have just woke up from a 5 year coma asymmetric wings i guarantee you was studied the f14 flew with asymmetric wings in testing there is a picture of it with one wing forward and one full back  winglet configuration has a much smaller impact on flight characteristics than horizontal stabilizer trim does so no planes are going to fall out the sky even if the plane wants to start dabbing out of the blue  you think like a safety engineer i like it aircraft and equipment manufacturers do extensive analysis of every possible failure mode and combination of failures to ensure that systems are safe and in compliance with regulations  are those little drawing on the sides the tails of their future customer is  i think those are kills this is going to be an a380 killer stop stop he is already dead  how does one get a ride on this bad boi  i have always thought the b777 was one of the best airliners of all  that is a good looking plane right there  my dream plane i am gonna fly that someday d boeing can definitely deliver great planes  ge 9x on 747 pls looks kinda funny though   fuck reddit is video player  can you imagine being seated last in aisle 450 middle seat n is airbus also expected to reveal any new plane designs  even if they did it wouldnt come out in time to compete with the 777x already out there a350 1k right but thats already in service and seeing as it only has 74 deliveries that isnt a large competition compared to the 363 orders the 777x already has airbus already has the a330 and a350 they are not going to put a third wide body into production boeing has the 787 and 777 going those are your competitors at the moment  u savevideo the engines are so big that u could fit a 737 fuselage through them   in production is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that headline never mind that there were larger planes being produced as recently as six months ago  how long until these things are finally delivered  i took a 777 to japan in 2015 truly an incredible aircraft  that is absolutely awesome first time i have ever seen them from that kind of angle so much more interesting than from the ground looking up lol great video  they do not all look like that very high moisture content required to make that amount of contrails i have flown jets for 22 years and never seen anything like that  i ai not no planeologist but i think they may have been behind you  i read this as paleontologist would not know about that i ai not into book learnin  but are you into doing the fandango  that costs extra  if i had an award to give you i would edit gah thank you    edit cheeky fuck that is why they have the rear view mirror duh target the reavers target the reavers target everyone somebody fire  i do not want to alarm anybody but i think we are being followed time for a crazy ivan  i am a leaf      too soon mean   on the wind    i saw this and the first thing i thought was firefly  goosebumps so many normal folks here  can not stop the signal mal what is this from    thanks i knew it sounded familiar just could not place it  totally looks like a spaceship entering earth is atmosphere in a movie  shiny  i aim to misbehave  you just won the internet in the whole haverse for the day    similar thing happens on r space every post with a picture of earth from space has people just spamming the comments with flat earth jokes same for moon landing conspiracy nonsense  see also the pop culture stuff that reddit does not care about but needs to constantly talk about how they do not care about it in my time online i have seen 100x more people posting about how they do not care about the kardashians or than i have seen actually discussing  i have never argued with a chemtrail believer but i have wondered how they can believe a civilian pilot would be okay with dropping chemicals indiscriminately on random citizens including their own families not to mention partaking in outdoor recreation on the ground while other bad pilots are dropping chemicals on him i imagine the mental gymnastics are award winning  to be technical dihydrogen monoxide is 100percent lethal in varying amounts over time if you come in contact with dihydrogen monoxide you will die eventually  do not forget withdrawal is fatal also  i was here hoping to figure out what was going on in the video myself lol not chemtrail jokes contrails are actually ice particles we tend to spray the mind controlling substances much lower to the ground because spraying it all the way up there would be wasteful and silly  i read they are spraying nebulized corona vaccine via aircraft in areas that have a low compliance with vaccine mandates  god i wish oh no they are turning the frogs gay  i never understood how a person could think a passenger plane could contain chemicals in huge amounts that would allow it to spray chemtrails that are kilometers and kilometers long where are they storing it and why would they make it visible  it is a fuel additive is my rough understanding of the conspiracy theory  ah so it needs to be incinerated at high pressure to be effective  i have no idea it is not like they actually have to make sense when scrutinized making shit up it just has to make sense in a single context with no questions being asked that bring up any possible short comings even if you do they can alway make ad hoc rationalizations based on maintaining the narrative like the fuel additive can withstand the heat of a jet engine i do not know what the chemical is or it is properties but to keep believing it i have to believe that too    i currently work with two people who believe in chemtrails i do not really want to engage them on the topic because i am sure i will be perceived as thinking they are stupid  i work in a television news station newsroom and answer the phones as part of my job i am also attending embry riddle which is part of the reason i joined this subreddit anyway last week a woman called the newsroom and said go outside and look at the sky there are lines everywhere it is some sort of military op they are dropping chemtrails we are at war i calmly told the woman those are contrails from planes on the approach to mco the woman replied with my brother in law is a pilot i know the difference between chemtrails and contrails i assured the woman there is nothing to worry about and chemtrails are no being dropped in central florida the woman then asked me how was telling me to say that and how much i was getting paid to deny the truth and allow people to be poisoned  i watched this idiot on youtube say a 787 was dumping fuel over indiana because one of the wings looks like a thin tube on her phone i told her it was the planes right wing she also thinks her phone zoomed in to the sky thinks stars are spaceships because her phone can not resolve anything while her hand wriggles the phone around  well the people that unironically believe the dogshit that comes out of alex jones mouth are not the sharpest tools in the shed  atrazine is real though and it did turn frogs hermaphroditic that we are exposed to normal levels of it in the run off water ruined a black scientist career because of his discovery as well i will attach a article from berkeley to show you the study is results   not sure why you were downvoted this was the basis for the whole alex jones rant he is a real piece of shit but some of his stories start off grounded in reality like this study and then he just takes it and brings it into batshit insane territory for his idiot listeners  yea i can definitely agree with that but you gotta remember he is kinda retarded agreed but he was also ranting about epstein since at least 2014  he is thrown enough shit at the wall something was eventually bound to stick he is the broken clock that was finally right  that is the same for a lot of conspiracy theories they start out with a kernel of truth then snowball with more layers of shit until the original idea is unrecognizable  hahaha just looked into this and yes atrazine in drinking water does sound like it might be a risk but to think that this is the government doing it and not a result of agricultural runoff is absurd i wonder why jones did not blame midwest farmers one of the right wing is big supporters for this s if amy pillow pillows were found to contain a a hazardous material jones would blame it on the tooth fairy obviously libtard code for the gays sneaking in at night and putting it there and not at all related to the material in the pillow  the issue is the epa did everything in their power to suppress this information and allow the company producing it to continue sales they put red tape in front of dr hayes every time he presented his information  yeah totally get the epa was influenced by big business to continue allowing a pesticide to be sold that is bad but not really unheard of eg cigarettes asbestos etc here is an article about it recently in the previous and ministration  jones idea that the government was actively introducing it into drinking water or food is the absurd part  that is why they charge so much for checked bags it takes up space for the gay frog juice hillary is jizz trails are pois on us i had a truck that did that i think the plane needs new head gaskets   oopsie pilot accidentally fully openned chemtrails valve  can someone please explain what exactly is happening  water vapor in the engine exhaust is condensing in the cold air and forming a long narrow cloud behind the aircraft a condensation trail or contrail normally looking at them from the ground contrails look quite thin but from this angle nearly head on it is clear that the contrail is actually much larger than it appears from the ground  technically most of the water vapor is from the high humidity air the plane is flying through the engine exhaust is putting out ccns particles that the water vapor can condense on basically soot which is causing most of the cloud being formed yes there is some water vapor in the exhaust but that is not the majority of the cloud  ahh thanks it is obvious that contrail formation has to depend on the atmospheric conditions in some way as not all flights produce contrails i figured humidity was part of that but i never quite connected all the dots thanks for clearing that up    in this case there is not any condensation from the wingtips sometimes you do get condensation there when landing in very humid weather this is from very low pressure at the center of the wingtip vortices the air whirls like a tornado at the wing tip  the comment might also be referring to how after the contrails are created they are subsequently blown around and twisted by the wingtip vortices created by the wings good video on wing tip vortices and winglets from mentour pilot  cool thanks  in addition to what the first reply said the shape of the contrails is due to vortex shedding an aerodynamic effect off the wings it is the twisting up and to the middle of the condensation  u mean chemtrails with which the goverment controls our minds but seriously now beautiful shot  the chem tanks on the 787 must be massive those trails are huge  edit nice 69 up doots  looks like the chemtrail mixture may have got stuck on the fully rich setting  with the weight savings of the carbon fiber reinforced plastic fuselage the 787 dreamliner can hold approximately 30percent more chemtrail solution than it is closest competitor and still have a fuel savings of over 12percent  it is crazy people actually believe this i had a friend who did i have been an aircraft mechanic going on 21 years now i told him do not you think i would know this he was convinced they hid it from me as well  ikr as if spirit airlines would be okay with having to haul 1 000 pounds of extra weight for the feds those bitches practically charge you extra to take a piss i bet if they actually had to do a water landing they would charge you for life vests too  their thinking is sound though if everyone took a piss before getting on the plane the savings in fuel costs would be huge  150 people emptying their bladders 300 400ml would yield about 45 kg of weight i do not consider it all that significan not  except aa saved something like dollar1mil a year by taking one olive out of the first class salads  due to the price of olives not the weight of olives  ryanair saved millions in fuel by taking the nets off the back of the seats lol i do not know what it is with these conspiracies and how people believe them leaving a trail of gay frogs in it is wake  i looked it up and chemtrail loonies think all the chemtrail planes look like this or like this  haha totally not balast for testing i bet this plane came from dia  i do not subscribe to the mind control theory myself but as a method of reflecting sunlight in order to cool the atmosphere  it actually has the opposite effect it traps heat from escaping into space but does not reflect enough sunlight to offset the amount of trapped heat  the balance between earth is incoming sunlight and outgoing heat drives climate change contrails trap energy coming off the earth and atmosphere below that would otherwise find its way to space persisting contrails can spread into extensive cirrus clouds that tend to warm earth because they reflect less sunlight than the amount of heat they trap   woah   that is why it is a corrected title op had to redact the information correctly  the reason why it said corrected was i fat fingered the title and had a couple of extra characters in there  chief look it is the pillar of autumn  i wish i had gold to give you flawless cowboy  i once tried convince my wife contrails are steam from the bathroom when someone is taking a shower in first class i then showed her a picture of the shower emirates has on their a380 is as proof she almost bought it how was this filmed from this angle  passing planes   planes typically have a minimum vertical separation requirement of 1 000 feet it may look closer to the untrained eye  i would argue that contrails are rather common  your mistaking them for chemtrails s moist icy very true very icy cmiiw there is no english word for humid air below the melting point like icy moist there needs to be moist implies liquid very friggin cold up there  i would like to show this to chemtrails believer and ask how much chemicals can a plane hold like seriously the sheer volume of the condensation is insane one brief look is enough to see that this thing is not coming from a plane  i mean it is pretty well understood that liquids can take up way more space when aerosolized like think of how much comes out of a single can of spray paint or how big a cloud of smoke you could get from burning just a couple of logs and it is combustion byproducts like water vapor and particulates and whatever that forms these all of which originated in the fuel tank a glider does not make contrails does not seem like a particularly strong argument tbh  you may be right man come to think of it honestly thought this was a scifi film at first wow that is spectacular looks like there was also some low pressure vapor being formed as well so cool damn that bitch is breeeeaaaathiiiiinnn that should be used for wake turbulence training the vortexes are textbook  totally understand why folks mistake em for ufo s    well i thought i had thank you for bringing it to my attention if you look in my post history on reddit and imgur i post the source 99percent of the time  it is not a problem not enough to look into your post history at least the title is verbatim his yt video title anyway  yeah that is why i posted the source it was late and probably got distracted my late is other is early   s omg its the govt spraying us with chemicals and controlling the weather videos like this make the government mind control worth it  pretty awesome that is a lot of gay frogs i do not like it any more than you do pal  definitely dumping mind controlling chemicals here ha can not hide the truth now s awesome video by the way  it is the amphibian homosexualizer  the secret chemtrails button has been pressed do not you mean chemtrails  the chem trails are real  chemtrailing the shit out of oregon      no this is not british  dude there is literally no way these could be chemtrails first of all the volume that plane is spitting out if it had chemtrails is insane it would drastically shorten the range to hold enough to do this constantly on top of that the altitude judging by the ground is high enough that the cold air coming in contact with the very hot engine exhaust would make steam do not believe me look at the way the trails are forming also where would the fluid be injected into the engine i suppose the bypass ducts but that would make a very obvious shape that these trails do not have  did you follow the link  why is it rare contrails happen every day  the dreamliner does not normally get up this early oh ok  just enjoy it the perspective contrails are not at all rare do you often see videos of contrails forming from the perspective of a plane passing above  yes actually quite often in real life it it does not take away from a nice perspective of this video and a rising sun  but to imply that contrails are rare is not true at all that is where my statement above is coming from  they are certainly not rare but seeing them this dramatic is fairly uncommon  how cool and efficient to spread the vaccine  you just had to know boeing was in the r chemtrails business chemtrails  u savevideo the guys in south carolina forgot to take their bong out of the secret hot boxing room at the back end  my powerplant instructor used to hate whenever we were in the cockpit and i used to ask him which switch turned on the chemtrail generators so i made a point to do it every single time  just look at all the chemicals coming out of that thing more like chemtrails amirite i do not typically buy into contrail conspiracies but i am almost certain that is atomized salt peter looks like it is creating a staircase from heaven to earth simply stunning man it really puts into perspective how aviation is like 30percent of carbon transport pollution looks like a locomotive in the sky  necromonger ship reminds me of close encounters of the 3rd kind the aliens used clouds as cover  watching this gives me the same vibes as gliding over farosh in botw  you spelled chemtrails wrong rolling coal  where is it being filmed from it is not moving and so high  how many m s of air engines consume   u stabbot someones vaping it up in the bathroom i am taking the cloud down with me  i am so dumb i was almost halfway through the video before i understood what i was looking at  amazing footage how did you take this video where did you take it from thanks  this was taken from a 747 over the far east of russia and the crossing traffic was 1 000 below  wow amazing look at all that cloud seeding s  looks like the mothership riding a plasma wave out of orbit  where would you take this photo from  this was taken from a 747 over the far east of russia and the crossing traffic was 1 000 below  cool  u savevideo     i am a bot  a link to the gif or comment in your messagepercent2c ipercent27m not always sure which request is being reported thanks for helping me out  what building were they in when they took this  this is epic there never has been a hull loss crash or any fatalities involving a boeing 787 dreamliner this plane has been around for over 10 years so that is a pretty good safety record personally i would much rather fly on a dreamliner than say a 737 max 100k miles year here the dreamliner is hands down my fav long haul equipment from the lighting to cabin pressure tech to noise levels to the dimmable windows to the space available obvs depending on carrier and class but in general there is a lot of room on that thing to cabin layout dito it is a great plane to spend 10 hours in i rmember my first flight in it and noticing that even the cabin crew really enjoyed the environment enjoy japan  it is one of the quietest plane so far the windows can be dimmed individually cabin pressure is at 6000ft so it help with jetlag a lot flown on both 787 9 and 10 and tbh they are great planes  should i be worried i keep seeing it in the news and really nervous to fly as a passenger nah the media just love clicks  hope so lol i have flown over the pacific to from tokyo in a 787 about 14 times without any issues at all it is by far my favorite plane out of all the widebody planes i have flown in which includes 747s 767s and 777s it is a wonderful experience and as safe as you can get one recent fight from tokyo to la had some pretty bad turbulence for several hours but the plane handled it very well and after researching more after returning home i realized the plane could have handled much worse i love sitting by the wings so i can see their beautiful shape as they flex during takeoff  i have flown transpacific many times from north america to various asian destinations the 787 is by far the best aircraft for long haul flights the lower noise smoothness and especially the increased humidity make a tremendous difference in comfort and how you feel at the end of the flight think about it this way the dreamliner is the top of the line airplane for airlines that fly it so the crews are the best and most experienced the airline has it is not a puddle jumper flown by the 1501 hour new guy enjoy your trip and do not worry about the flight edit to add while the 787 is a marvel of modern engineering and my favorite the electronic dimming windows are not that marvelous i prefer the cheap plastic shade lol  i was on a dreamliner a little while ago and sat next to a lady who was afraid of flying i explained to her how it is one of the most modern and respected jets out there and that seemed to help just fyi the wings flex on a 787 more than some other aircraft from what i understand the flexing is a side effect of the 787 is modern composite materials and relatively wide wingspan completely normal but it looks different i figure if you are a nervous flyer it is better to know this ahead of time personally i think it is really cool  my partner is a nervous flyer to she said she liked the 787 due to its capacious environment i do not fly long haul much but when i do i would prefer the 787 i am 6 3 and this thing is comfortable good luck bro  i did the same by researching planes to get over my fear and anxiety so i know what to expect and i think it has helped greatly hope it does for you on opposition i love watching planes the take off and landing just not the cruising part  if one of those engines fails how far will the other one take us  all i can tell ya is that we beat the paramedics there by a half hour  just kidding man we can get home on one   all the way to the scene of the craaash  is that robert schimmel  it is tater salad     engines turn or people swim baby  did the crew actually announce that there is smoke in the cockpit  yes  wow i would not expect them to announce the actual reason until maybe after landing is it a requirement for them to announce the exact reason or something  more than likely they had their o2 masks on and had ran the qrh just waiting on fuel to get to the right weight before landing also probably a good idea to explain what we are seeing in the picture to the passengers especially if you have extra time  thanks for the explanation i fly passenger a hell of a lot and touch wood never ever had a technical issue couple of go arounds and a bounce landing but thats it  you are supposed to knock on wood not just touch it p i am from uk so i just touch it americans knock on it both ways are scientifically proven to work just fine d oh interesting i had no idea that they did it differently in the uk haha let is not even get started on which is the correct side of the road p it is touch iron tocca ferro in italy gotta google why  touching wood has a lot of connotations here in the us  depends what you are in to  you never ever had a technical issue  that you know of  fuck that smoke overweight landing screw dumping fuel  i think it depends on the captain i have flown with some that tell passengers exactly what is going on and some that will literally make shit up that does not sound as bad as what is actually happening then all in between i tend to be honest unless there is an issue that no one knows about those times i just keep it within the crew no reason to worry people  i like the no reason to worry people attitude have you ever actually been worried yourself or is it just like ah engine failure no worries we have another one   ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking we have a small problem all four engines have stopped we are doing our damnedest to get them going again i trust you are not in too much distress  lol i read about this actually happening one time think it was singapore airlines or silk air where both engines had a spark out forgive me if thats the wrong term and the plane descended 12000ft i think while the pilots went through the procedure to get them both restarted that is scary edit ok its called a flameout and the quote from above was the actual quote from the captain of the flight i was thinking of it was british airways flight 9 do not know why i thought of singapore  also happened to a british airways 747 after it flew into volcanic ash   lol only worried once in the airline world and it was just recently had really bad windshear and dropped from 900 feet to 400 feet all while engines were max thrust that being said i do not really think worried is the right word it was more really focused on not flying the plane into the ground then afterwards was something along the lines of holy fuck more adrenaline then anything  depends is there a bingo scheme running on board  i know its stupid but is it safe to dump fuel to the atmosphere  it is not great but it immediately evaporates so long as you do it at a safe altitude usually 6000ft nobody can tell the difference compared to the environmental damage caused by all the other fossil fuel usage worldwide it is fine  quick explanation planes are required to dump fuel if they have to land shortly after takeoff especially on long distance flights the combined weight of passengers freight luggage and fuel makes the plane heavier than the maximum landing weight which is normally much lower than the maximum takeoff weight normally they burn the fuel and arrive light enough to land if due to technical failure etc they have to land early fuel dumping is necessary there are normally designated areas where they are allowed to do that and the fuel doesn t reach the ground immediately most of it gets broken down by uv light and other environmental influences the rest gets diluted of course it s still very bad for the environment but at least we can be sure that due to the high cost airlines are not doing it just for shits and giggles  hydrocarbons are generally close to harmless at low concentrations bacteria consume them very quickly the risk is human or animal consumption of high concentrations or crude oil fouling everything up for instance leaky underground storage tanks are generally just monitored for impact to water sources if there is not a risk of contamination they just let it break down naturally which occurrs pretty quickly  the vocs do but the heavier molecular components of hydrocarbons remain and need remediation using specialized equipment they can burn it off the soil create bacteria in a lab to target the area aerate the soil or a host of other remediation techniques but leaving an ugst in situ leaking or the result of a leak will not just magically become solved  this guy epa is  is that the use for an air compressor at a contamination site my work has one way out in the woods but apparently we used to do some dumping when we used to use more aggressive chemicals aerating could use forced air aerobic with oxygen decomposition is much faster  wich bacteria for example aromatic oil dilution is the solution to pollution  some planes are not capable of dumping and need to fly around and burn off the fuel instead they do not have to if a situation warrants an immediate landing like a medical emergency or some sort of progressive failure which continued flight risks degrading to a more serious condition they can land safely overweight  yeah max landing weight is generally based on 600 700fpm descent rate on touchdown basically a stable approach with no flare provided you flare normally most aircraft can touchdown safely at max takeoff weight  why not just dump passengers instead would be more environmentally friendly  liability issues passengers don t evaporate on their way down also hurts return business  i just thrilled by seeing the plane dumping a lot of fuel that triggered my concern about the environment but to save everyone else is life i think its okay oh boy if you are concerned about the environment then hearing that places like india and china exist is really going to bum you out  or you know the us meh not really considering that the us is the second largest producer of co2 in the world with emissions per capita twice as high as china and ten times that of india yes really  the per capita argument is not a great measurement in this case china and india have huge populations of people that produce almost no co2 emissions their populations that do are also huge but since they have so many people it gets diluted a better comparison would be to look at china is middle and upper class vs the us in that case it is not even close   gt a better comparison would be to look at china is middle and upper class vs the us in that case it is not even close you got any sources for that not trying to call you out i am just curious  you wouldent need a source he is not stating fact it is pretty low level common sense to assume it would be a better comparison   atleast the us is doing something about it besides c02 emissions you also have among others water pollution where china and others are far worse compared to the us just looking at raw c02 output is not enough  afters decades of environmental destruction a few steps to feign deliberation is not enough across the history of the nations usa is by far the clear leader in destruction of environment by a long long margin also i am curious what you would think about the gulf of mexico being injected with an unholy amount of oil spill just because the guilty company bought the so called usa authorities and regulators  what would happen if you dump fuel at say crusing attitude still evaporates  higher altitude would mean lower pressure so yes it would still evaporate  if you have some altitude it will evaporate before hitting the ground at too low altitude it might cause a stink but since you are doing it at speed it will be pretty spread out and just a minor smell of fuel much like you would smell around an airport  safer anyway than the potential crash runway excursion of an overweight landing and having to fly in a replacement plane repair crew potentially writing off a plane its not exactly environmentally sound either    the difference between a whiff of it like you smell at airports everywhere vs getting a bucket of the stuff poured over you personally i do not mind the smell all that much  well the visuals may seem extreme but that is fuel that would otherwise be burned and released into the atmosphere anyway not too sure but i would be surprised if dumping fuel is actually less polluting than burning it and releasing emissions into the atmosphere  i would imagine it would be worse for ground pollution like rivers and lakes vs air pollution it atomizes and evaporates before getting to the ground the plane would need to be at fairly low altitude for liquid fuel to actually hit anything below  i believe anything above 5000 feet is fine it should atomize in 3000 feet the problem i once heard at jfk was a relatively new pilot got a little antsy with a flame out and started dumping immediately which taking off just off v1 that caused jet a to be spilled on the ground  exhaust can mix with rain and cause similar effects it is possible that the optics of seeing liquid feul dump may just be more emotionaly gripping than seeing it burned i have heard fish really like a dash of jet a1 in their water gives it a bit more of a kick  if it is over a pasture it is just pre seasoning the steaks with jet a1 sauce  well it is safer than not dumping the fuel crashing and killing 300 people   gt i know its stupid but is it safe to dump fuel to the atmosphere compared to what  just curious compared to burning the fuel like usual    that does not answer the question what is this and what is the problem and what is your solution  the issue is the airplane can not safely land with a full load of fuel extra fuel which is about 8 lbs gallon increases the touchdown speed to possibly out of safe limits and stopping distance perhaps to longer than the available runway  thanks for the info i never thought about that kind of details when riding an airplane i am just a normal passenger haha 6 7 lbs gallon is the standardized denisity for jet fuel it varies somewhat with temperature and other factors but never reaches 8lbs gallon that is the density of water amp x200b also it is not just landing speed and distance considerations but the potential for airframe landing gear structural overload  if you are doing a carrier landing in a big jet if you grease it on then no more stress than was placed on the gear when the plane took off yea it is been quite a few years 6 7 is correct  no worries was not being critical here  sure fuel  jk i am a mechanic do not kill me   no chem trails control the weather everyone knows this you are thinking of fluoride  how many of the chemtrail dispenser pods have you installed this week we are just getting around to fitting them on our fleet horrible access though right  you know the external tanks on f 16s not fuel rather easy access though we have done about 17 aircraft this week  great work my friend patrol the skies and control the minds  still a beautiful airplane even though she just wee would herself a little   kinda interesting to see  why did they start the flight so far off course i am confused the blue dotted line is the planned route yes  airliners are typically cleared to fly a standard instrument departure sid when leaving a major airport the sid takes into account a lot of things like separating arrival and departure traffic noise abatement terrain clearance etc sids are also different for the different runways at a given airport in addition you can be vectored off the sid for a variety of reasons most commonly severe weather for all of these reasons the exact departure path for any given flight is difficult to predict beforehand you will notice that before the turn for the diversion the aircraft was on a heading that would have intercepted its intended route that is pretty typical once you get out of the high traffic area and clear of weather you are cleared to re establish on the intended route climb to altitude and be on your way  it is hard to really know for this particular situation but it could have been weather or general traffic atc also likes to work with pilots and give them shortcuts whenever possible which means maybe they can skip a waypoint or two to make the flight a little quicker  but they diverted that is what this post is the planned route is all the way from the origin which i am guessing is probably either sfo or lax no i get that the planned route blue dots goes to lax but immediately leaving melbourne they do not follow the planned route they are way off course when they start the diversion  wind other traffic it is perfectly normal assuming that the left turn off the east cost of australia is the point where the flight was diverted then why did not they turn back to the mainland was it due to altitude and the required fuel dump time i can understand that they would not want to do that in what i assume is busy airspace with sydney and brisbane being close  this is a safety feature it is actually dumping the smoke so the pilots can see   a passenger needs to talk to the pilots faint music from behind doors dadadadada cough uh not the time it is the motherfucking d o double g    holy shit was that movie really this bad woooooow  hilarious risky click of the day  some how some way keep it coming with that funky ass shit like every single day  snoop ddddooooggggggg holy hell how much smoke was on the cockpit its a joke chingos i know this is sarcasm but part of me is not entirely sure you are not describing some novel new feature of the 787  this is a feature of airplanes to be able to drop fuel airplanes can take off heavier than they can land this is for real its been around for a long time  i think they meant dumping smoke ok thanks they would never vent smoke that is just adding more oxygen to a fire what helps aircraft contain fire is the fire is compartmentalized the problem is as you are flying its almost impossible to figure out where the fire is planes now have smoke and heat detectors in there cargo bays but the smoke could be coming from elsewhere  even just a fault in one of the packs that is causing something to turn into smoke but that is not really a fire i have heard of a couple cases where different fluids somehow made their way into the packs and caused smoke to appear even with no fire involved  sometimes electrical components just have to let go of some magic smoke  dank wait the pilots turned the plane into a giant bong nice  thats amazing err no that is fuel being jettisoned to lighten the total weight for landing the smoke ventilates out the back through the pressurisation outflow valve with all the other air circulating in the cabin  and the woosh was heard for miles  you just got bamboozled   he is taking the piss bruv  twas a joke some pilots what is that  lol you are gullible chemtrails metric fuckton of gay frogs inbound on your position there will be thrusting  i came looking for this the username definitely checks out need to incorporate metric fuckton more into my convos how else are you going to turn the frogs gay  literally  to an airline executive that is dumping money  better to dump fuel than an entire aircraft  nah insurance pays for planes and dead bodies  how about customers that book with another airline after a crash  ask for a government bailout  username checks out yea socialists are not typically into taxpayer bailouts of massive corporations they should rewatch lost insurance covers only about 1 70th of an accident cost funny i said the same about medical insurance airlines waste an incredible amount of fuel every day while they nickel and dime their employees and passengers when it comes to spending a dollar to save a penny airlines may even beat the government i get memos weekly telling me not to run the apu on the ground when it is sweltering hot for the passengers because it will save 20 pounds of fuel meanwhile i spend at least an hour each week running the engines waiting for a gate because they have no gates available or ground personnel available to park us the engines burn about 1000 pounds of fuel per hour on the ground   gt i get memos weekly telling me not to run the apu on the ground when it is sweltering hot for the passengers because it will save 20 pounds of fuel  sounds like a great way to retain your customer base  the airlines know that everyone goes on kayak and books the lowest fare no matter how much they hate that airline look at all the spirit and united hate online yet those airlines are very profitable if you save dollar5 on your fare but are sweating hot the airlines know you will still book it  that so much that cause if sucks  fly for american into lax much  found the aa pilot  i wish i am just regional pilot who is likely never going to mainline  why i thought there was a shortage unless that was a lie the shortage does not exist at the mainline legacy carriers regional and corporate are feeling the shortage for sure  are there any perks to being a corporate pilot  it is hit and miss some jobs are good some suck in general it is more work than 121 airline stuff since you are probably doing the flightplan getting notams possibly making the hotel arrangements etc you also load the bags though it is not like you have 250 people is worth of bags to load perks really depends on the job like i said more potential for home basing more day trips some operators others have worse schedules you do not need an atp to be right seat some cooler planes some expenses paid some it is just  different overall 121 has more stability and many would consider it a better career path but some people enjoy and embrace the 135 and 91 life of course there are some unicorn 91 jobs that pay dollar300k with minimal overnights  there will probably be a shortage someday at the regional airlines but there will not be one at high paying majors    i was lazy and had some medical problems early in my training so i had too many checkride failures i exceed the hard cutoff most major airlines have  ahh regional economics 101 fuel is a pass through cost and so are the engines through block time but the apu hourly maintenance reserve dollar75 hr is largely absorbed by the operator so for the regional the time and fuel waiting for a gate is paid for but the apu usage at the gate is an expense plus the passengers are not the regionals customer  75 gallons a side sitting assuming it is a twin that does not seem like enough  1000pph sounds about right maybe closer to 1200 or 1400 depending on the engines hope those passengers were able to pick up some  while in new caledonia since that is the only place in the world they live in fact they live in that very southern section of the island where the airport is   crested gecko the crested gecko correlophus ciliatus is a species of gecko native to southern new caledonia in 1866 the crested gecko was discovered by a french zoologist named alphone guichenot who is also credited with naming the species this species was thought extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 during an expedition led by robert seipp along with several rhacodactylus species it is being considered for protected status by the convention on the international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna         downvote to remove  v0 28 i hope the unexpected stop in south pacific was nice  oh no hope it is a minor issue i love the dreamliner  i wonder what seat row this was taken from  wouldo you smell smoke in the flight deck captain  no douglas i do not  match lights  how about now    if it happens common causes could be electrical shorts arcing malfunctioning avionics cooling or ventilation fans or air conditioning duct work that has come loose  i was always curious as to why dump fuel for emergency landing obviously in case of a crash but what i learned on youtube was a plan landing with that much weight can cause extreme force on the gear and plane in general when landing as it is not meant to land exactly how it takes off great capture thanks for sharing  i can be a good person and scrimp and save fuel my whole life and not save as much as this wasted  planes and treehouse my two favorite things  i had a marvelous experience of flying in dreamliner 787 in 2018 when i traveled to manchester uk wish i could also witness the contrails in flight  i feel this is a missed opportunity a strategically and safely placed afterburner igniter is warranted here to get the full spectacular effect of that fuel plume igniting to truly scare the crap out of the passengers  this was trent  nope united use genx is smell in cabo is more engine that aircraft most of the time something leaked to customer bleed if it is oil good decision e what is cabo autocorrect    you are right dreamliner uses bleed or separate electrical pump to pressurize the cabin  787 uses electric pressurization no engine bleed air involved  electric pump    one would presume the 787 dump chutes work much more efficiently than the ones on my beloved awacs i think i found the plane from donnie darko now we have proof chemtrails are real  i hate flying i would be having a panic attack   how many times are we going to tell the pilot to not barbecue in the cockpit during flight s   seeing as it is housed in both wings i am going to assume both  with all the 737 is flying themselves into the ground i almost forgot about how much 787 is like to light themselves on fire  wtf smoke overweight landing screw dumping fuel get your ass on the ground asap maybe dump while enroute to the diversion but safety comes first and i would go as far as acarsing my crew that too if they decided to overly a suitable airport  i was actually on this exact flight for the next day melbourne to lax believe its ua99  its literally in the title is there any publicly available data on how the early dreamliners have fared so far i flew on a brand new united 787 in january of 2013 and i was so impressed we took a 777 on the flight home due to the li ion battery issues on the dreamliners though there must be exponentially more data available now on composites than there was even a decade or two ago since there are deployed now in so many places  they have been fine there is been no 787 hull losses and with well over a 1 000 flying there is not even been a whiff of any issues related to what he is claiming not sure why op keeps saying this is going to lead to a repeat of the titan or that composites are some unknown material either  oh yeah i know all that i love flying on the 787 the titan comparison also does not make a ton of sense because the forces were different also planes are good pressure in the titan failed to keep it out my question was more about material science i wonder what they have found that they were not expecting or what they would different now etc like the paint issues on a350 is  so i am suuper fuzzy on the details so do not quote me on this but i do remember hearing about an interesting incident with a new air canada 787 a couple years ago they were on their way to asia somewhere before having to declare an emergency and divert to alaska due to an oil issue supposedly they investigated and found that the malfunctioning part system left the factory in that condition even though boeing had signed off on it suggesting another possibly pencil whipped inspection if that is all true not sure if that falls more on boeing or air canada but a little eyebrow raising either way  no that was an issue that would not be detected until some time in service it was possible it could have failed during production flight test and been detected but it was not  the 787 has the best on time and reliability rate with no major incidents and no hull losses which is a surprise given what i know about it  with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse at least difficult compared with conventional metals and so when they fail it is all at once and somewhat unpredictable like titan i would expect the composites to last several decades but then perhaps experience unpredictable and catastrophic failure related perhaps to the pressurisation cycles i just do not think any of them have been in service long enough currently to be a problem yet  would not service life of composite materials already be studied by material engineers before being put into active aircraft and also being cycled until failure i am sure a lot of the data of the materials are known upfront yes  nope aircraft composites are extremely new in engineering terms and poorly understood relative to traditional metals and much of our ignorance about composites concerns how they will behave in the future particularly after thousands of pressurization cycles that is not something that can be easily modelled look at the paint on the dreamliner wings that flex and then peel it was apparently completely unforeseen and there is still no solution for it  because of the anisotropic characteristics of strength composite materials are extremely difficult in fatigue analyzing this phenomena causes a damage throughout the volume of specimen leading to degradation of the material   they absolutely did fatigue testing on the 787 fuselage   they do fatigue testing routinely on all aircraft we are clearly here talking about fatigue after decades of use the issues are that we do not know how composites will change over time in their fatigue characteristics and composites in particular do not fatigue like traditional metals they do not really bend they tend to just snap catastrophically and short of extremely precise literally atomic scale analyses it is difficult to predict that failure is imminent  because of the anisotropic characteristics of strength composite materials are extremely difficult in fatigue analyzing this phenomena causes a damage throughout the volume of specimen leading to degradation of the material   we know all of those things and have since the 70s there are books on it phds have been earned learning those things    you have no idea what you are talking about no more knowledge than what the news serves up   you do not know what you are talking about source am aerospace engineer  archive org   is not this a regular event though  this is the first i have heard of this particular issue sounds like the process that boeing is utilising to mate the different fuselage pieces together is warping the composite material and the likely result is some titan esque pressure related catastrophic failures in the future when the composite begins to age  christ on a cracker you have not got a clue the titan imploded because composites were being put under compression the thing composites are terrible at a pressurized fuselage is under positive pressure meaning the composite material is under tension aka the thing composites are best at your pressurization cycles comment shows a surface deep understanding of how mechanics of materials works you are not qualified to be making these comments just stop  yeah this guy thinks he is smart but is completely lacking knowledge  the titan submarine failed because they took it to an extreme depth far beyond what their viewing port was rated for the titan implosion was not unpredictable it was inevitable it has basically nothing in common with an airplane structure or warping composite the 777 empennage has been flying around with the same composite as the 787 for 30 years and has never caused a hull loss the 777 from 30 years ago does not use anywhere near the same proportion of composites as the dreamliner does  the figure shows that around 50percent material used in boeing 787 is composite material with comparison to the boeing 777 which used only 12percent of composite and 70percent aluminum i also disagree with your assessment of the titan while it should not have been used for those purposes precisely because composites and extreme pressures do not mix because of composite fatigue as a matter of engineering and design it was in perfect condition theoretically safe to descend to that depth and had done so many times the issue was that testing for composite fatigue is basically impossible and had they been able to do so they likely would not have descended in the first place perhaps 50 years from now somebody on the then reddit equivalent will be referring to future dreaminliner hull losses as inevitable for the same reason  that is why i said 777 empennage  what is your point though the issue is obviously surely with pressurisation cycles the empennage experiences ambient pressure and no pressurisation cycles  your initial comment seemed to imply all composites will unpredictably and catastrophically fail just because some idiot designed a crappy submarine and i gave you an example of an application that has been safely flying for decades without major incident the empennage is not pressurized but it is still subject to aero forces and fatigue and ambient pressure obviously changes considerably at altitude i never insinuated that all composites will fail this is what i said gt my understanding is that with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse at least difficult compared with conventional metals and so when they fail it is all at once and somewhat unpredictable like titan i would expect the composites to last several decades but then perhaps experience unpredictable and catastrophic failure related perhaps to the pressurisation cycles i just do not think any of them have been in service long enough currently to be a problem yet notice the reference to pressurisation cycles gt my understanding is that with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse at least difficult compared with conventional metals this is objectively true regardless of the application of the composite this does not imply that all composites will fail though it depends on their application and regarding the empennage not sure if you are being purposely obtuse or what but no solid metal composite material being moved between altitudes does not experience anything even remotely comparable to the pressure changes that take place in the fuselage couplings every time the plane undergoes a pressurisation cycle that is not to say the empennage can not or will not undergo metal composite fatigue but that fatigue is due to completely different physical interactions with the surface of the stabiliser etc pressurisation of a container is completely different   gt empennage gt solid metal i have no idea what you are trying to say lmao  gt empennage gt gt solid metal gt gt i have no idea what you are trying to say lmao you can not understand that a sheet of solid metal is solid or that it is metal   gt my understanding is that with composites the stresses and strains in the metal are difficult to analyse what    now you are editing your comments lmao the titan was designed with a window only rated for a third of the depth they travelled why are you insistent composite fatigue was the failure and not the viewport collapsing the stupid submarine only went on 200 dives according to google aerospace fatigue limits are an order of magnitude higher than that  gt now you are editing your comments lmao what are you suggesting i edited gt why are you insistent composite fatigue was the failure and not the viewport collapsing because my profession deals with issues of legal negligence and engineering and i read a number of reports relating to the failure of the titan is hull in addition to having an engineering background in materials science gt the stupid submarine only went on 200 dives according to google aerospace fatigue limits are an order of magnitude higher than that it might have been inevitable but that is because it was a composite material it is not like it did one dive and failed on its maiden voyage    the report detailed numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns according to the filing these included lochridge is worry that visible flaws in the carbon fiber supplied to oceangate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during pressure cycling these are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor he noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had prevalent flaws  been going on for a long time problems are at a non union runway shop in sc   the problems started in everett i was once involved with the problem intimately  hi i was in charge of the team responsible for the 43 44 and 44 46 joins it is a beast to put together juuuust right takes a lot of shimming here and there for the circumferential frame to fit both fuselage halves and takes a long time a lot of epds ncs and engineering dispos along with custom machined shims engineering and management then spent the next hundred airplanes trying to streamline the process and likely lost configuration control and relaxed the tolerance    coooooould have effect the change went through stress analysis and was signed off by engineering using data i know a guy that did some work on it  unhhh those are some sparkly clean optics no visible artifacts even in a cell phone picture granted i will bet that hud cost gt dollar10 000  but still edit as many have pointed out the hud is likely in the solid 6 figures  it does not look like same one but this one is well under dollar100 000 just for the part   wow i was just spitballing you are right i will bet that hud is six figures not sure of your aviation experience but you would be amazed at how much things cost on aircraft especially airliners  i am an aerospace engineer who went into electronics so more than your average bear but probably less than the average commenter on this subreddit there are two little green specs near the altimeter bar but i would say that is from the refraction of the projector  or something edit typo ahhh you are right that is a diffraction artifact i am not seeing any ghosting though and the intensity is consistent across the display i do not know if the monochromatic display has anything to do with that diffractive waveguides are both incredibly difficult to manufacture and incredibly expensive edit i am having a mild existential crisis i think that might not be a diffractive waveguide i do not see any input grating is the projection coming from behind the display or something i do not know enough about optics to be able to say when i was taking the picture it was very hard to get the hud markings so legible like that there is a small blur on the bottom left hdg sel 155 and almost unnoticeable blur on the other parts of the hud it was a very hard shot to take given how smartphone cameras do not like these things i guess projections onto a glass display edit punctuation my guess would be that it is because the system was designed to couple with the human eye and not with a cell phone camera i am sure there is certainly some sort of reference imaging taking place during manufacturing for quality control purposes one of the biggest contributors to the cost of waveguide displays is the god awful yield rate you are paying for the display you got as well as the five others that went into the trash because they had rippling or something edit great picture though did not realize you were the one that took it shit i have never even been on a dreamliner i have never tried to take a picture of a 787 hud but i have had issues where if it is bright out the shutter speed is too fast to get all the parts since it draws as a scan rather than a full image if it is dark out there is no problem but during the day you only get a few lines of the actual display longer shutter speeds will make artifacts not actually in the hud appear  you can not get anything on an airplane for dollar10 000 likely that hud is a couple hundred thousand i just had to have an adi replaced on the aircraft i am currently flying not the gyro just the inidcator and it was dollar100 000  i am pretty sure our hud is over a million for all the components  if it is aerospace grade add a zero if it is military aerospace grade add two zeros or three welcome to sydney bay 51 indicates it is likely a us flight jq or ua  looked at the reflection ua it is  wow how do you even tell from the reflection untrained eyes i have add i can see it is a star alliance logo alright from the side of the plane must be missing some minute detail  the pin stripe i have spent too much time at sydney airport only two b787 operators are allocated bay 51 and jq does not have a pin stripe bottom left of the reflection  i am not that good at spotting planes i just know the airport well  thanks  ual842 knew it was australia thought it was melbourne    that is some funky music it sounds like a muzak version of enya  got a funny story about hud images i worked on hornets as a maintainer the sqn i was at trained fighter pilots on the hornet so one one evening we were launching for a afternoon mission and hear this over the radio to maint saying a pilot can see a weird hexagonal light in his hud turns out the stop he was parked in had an led light directly above the cockpit different from other parking spots we had a good laugh in the flightline  so the projector on the f 15 is behind the glare shield pointed up at the combining glass there is a hud camera to asses gun shots etc this dude is watching his tape to assess a gun shot and low and behold a beetle is walking around on the projector completely obscuring the other jet etc  it looked like something out of a bad 50 is sci fi film unassessable the bandit lives  i am happy that no matter what airframe it is shitty hud cameras are a thing i love all the different color filters they come in some look blue or green others a nice rustic sepia very artistic design consideration from lockheed  indeed especially the built in low res retro filter clearly forward design thinking for our generation i can sleep soundly at night knowing i flew in a fighter jet  needs mach indicator for when you go supersonic it does have a mach indicator ua879 south sfo  this is ual842 from syd to lax  for those of you wondering ual842 yssy klax 19th of december 2018 out 1120l 0020z off 1140l 0040z edit added destination formatting use the force luke   watch out you are going to fly into that building  can someone explain how they work  head up displays work by shining a projection of essential information to a screen the 787 has an overhead projector that essentially almost replicates the pfd it is a little different though as the hud needs to be less cluttered than the pfd because it is used in situations where the pfd is impractical like in low visibility weather they get this information from the irss inertial reference systems which then relay that information to the pfds and huds in the case of the 787 which has 2 huds one for the captain and one for the first officer edit typo just to add to this it does not just draw what is on the pfd it draws it as an overlay to the pilot is view out the windshield so that it augments what is seen when you are looking outside the aircraft they are also used far more than just in bad weather any time you are eyes outside they provide relevant data and generally improve sa and safety they also make landing super easy since they show where you are actually going so there is no need for a bug spot or to look for your aim point  yeah it also projects some other things that aid the pilot to navigate better like the declutter function and always shows the fpv so the pilots know exactly where the plane is heading regardless of the pitch it is always a good addition and i would not personally fly without one that is just me lol it is been more than a year since i have flown without one just one sim landing for currency it is truly amazing to have one  sydney  yes yssy klax am i the only one who did not know that the 787 had a hud this pilot needs to pull up  woah that huds almost exactly like the one in my flight sim the overhang is only 3 meters above ground i think your 787 probably is a bit taller than that  how do those things work anyway how is the image projected onto the screen  there is a projector above that relays a projection of important information to the display  all i can think of is mobius 1 fox 2  the clean lack of rivets is so fucking slick composites are cool  they certainly do have rivets they use rivets to put all the structures together skin to frame and skin to stringers are all metallic fasteners there is a coat of paint hiding them for now   how many in comparison to other jets of comparable size  many people believe that just because the 787 is mostly made of composite structures they think that the 787 is a monocoque structure skin is structure but just like all other aircrafts 330 777 etc 787 still has frames ribs stringers shear ties etc for structural reinforcements and all those composite or metallic structures such as a keel beam are tied together with metallic fastners such as rivets hiloks or bolts and nuts  how many in comparison to other jets of comparable size  sometimes things just look right same with the new airbuses  agree that is a great picture  rocking that speedtape on both windshield is hump seals he is a very skeptical dreamliner  i thought he looks very friendly  sour cream sanchez ol  must absolutely suck to be going the opposite direction  happy cake day and most westbound were around 300kt across the ground above fl200  wow now that is slow i thought i was taking a 787 turns out a cirrus sr22t would have been faster  maybe not a sr22 but i did have a sw4 showing 400kt across the ground last week they are not exactly a fast turboprop i managed 430 in a sw4 back when i used to fly up north can confirm it sucked ass going back though  agreed i was flying phl mdw in a 738 at this time and my ground speed was only 312 kt you would request higher or lower to find a favourable track it did not matter too much yesterday everything from fl220 fl400 had wind just about that strong dispatch tried to file us at fl280 to keep us below the strongest winds but we still had a 150kt headwind  reminds me of asking about rides sometimes yeah you are gonna have to go below 250 or above 430 to get a better ride sir so what you are really saying is there are no good rides quit asking me guys  absolute coincidence i happened to see a contrail heading west into the us from europe today over pennsylvania where i live the plane seemed to be going quite slow so i looked it up on flightradar and saw its ground speed was indeed quite low only 310 knots in an a330 at 38 000 feet heading to dulles from heathrow it was going to be a full hour late  can confirm i just stepped off a jfk sea flight that took a hair over 6 hours    there is a lot of plane talk that i do not understand going on  for the speed part you have to take your indicated airspeed from your air speed indicator and add the tailwind speed or subtract the headwind speed if your ias is 200kts and there is a 50kt tailwind your speed over the ground is 250kts if you have a 50kt headwind it is pushing against you meaning your speed over the ground is only 150kts ever see birds hovering in the air on a windy day they are flying forward the same speed as they are being pushed back air is flowing over their wings for lift but they are not covering any ground edit this is simplified for direct headwind and tailwind wind generally comes from different directions which means you have to compute your speed over the ground and wind correction if it is coming 45 degrees or a different angle other than head on your numbers will be different edit 2 yep meant tas my bad  true airspeed is actual what matters indicated or calibrated airspeed is actually a measurement of the momentum the air has this decrease greatly with altitude but may recover some due to compressibility at 50000 600t is only about 280 indicated  thanks for putting that in plain terms you mean plane terms  figured that was a bit too on the nose or just read what the box or atc tells you  tas not ias  that is actually not true indicated airspeed does not have much correlation to ground speed at fl350 with calm winds a jets indicated airspeed is around 250 knots and ground speed is around 450 knots because true airspeed is around 450 knots ground speed is the true airspeed corrected for wind indicated airspeed is going to be significan notly lower than true airspeed  just change altitude right  i flew four flights yesterday two of them against that jet stream and two with it we were doing 290 ground speed westbound and 650 eastbound on each turn we were 40 minutes late getting to our first destination then our second flight going back with the wind arrived on time  on a lighter note happy cake day  thank you   we had a 142 tailwind coming back to atlanta from vegas got in 29 minutes early  my transatlantic record was jfk gt lhr in 5hr 26 mins i think also on a virgin 787 pilot said it was his second fastest crossing ever not enough sleep 1st world problems  i did lhr bos a few years ago also on a virgin 787 and we landed 55 mins early then we sat on the ground for 25 mins because terminal e is too small    welcome to the uk apparently not if it takes that long to get through immigration  touch had the opposite issue last year lgw bos on a norwegian 787 took close to 8 hours awful on the flip side a few months ago i got from burbank to boston in just barely over 4 hours which is nice but when a redeye arrives over an hour early you feel slightly robbed  fucking fuck lhr it was not lhr that slowed us down it was bos  was this in 2015  yes it probably was how did you guesstimate that  has happened to me a few times gate still occupied sat on tarmac until regularly scheduled arrival   gt there were a lot of things we could not do in a 787  i will be taking this flight in two weeks maybe we will get in a little early  two weeks from now this wind pattern will not exist it is probably going to be around for the next day or so tops    according to that 801 mph 696 kt does not even crack the top 3 for the 789  right i saw that too plus the 744 has the highest minus the concorde my personal record in the plane i fly ties the record on that site if i had known that i probably could have gotten one extra knot  it would have been interesting to see one going the other way pull the throttles back see if the could get a negative ground speed wait so they broke the sound barrier of 767 mph i guess there were at high altitude so it did not pose any issues to the air frame at the barrier  ftfa amp x200b gt and you might notice something about the 801 mph reading it is above the speed of sound 767 mph commercial aircraft ordinarily can not break the sound barrier because they are not designed to handle the sudden increase in drag and other aerodynamic effects associated with those speeds despite a ground speed that high the plane did not come close to reaching that threshold because it was embedded in the swiftly moving air amp x200b  so its like a warp bubble just for sound and not light  no more like the air is moving with the jet the air is moving at 200mph relative to the ground the plane is moving at its usual 600mph relative to the air so relative to the ground the plane is moving at 800mph aha this i understand finally after reading all the comments got it thank you  mentour pilot has a great video about overspeed  amp x200b edit and this video about coffin corner  so the air around the jet is moving faster than 801mph speed of sound  that is a shitty explanation there was a strong tailwind going exactly the same direction as the aircraft the plane is still subsonic but is riding a 200mph ish wind in the same direction  while we are at it the speed of sound is not constant it depends on temperature the speed of sound in air in mph is 33 5 sqrt t 459 where t is the fahrenheit temperature   sqrt  if anyone is curious the speed of sound a is defined as sqrt rt where gamma in air is 1 4 r is the gas constant and t is the temperature of the gas so inside jet engines even with high speed the gas coming out of the combustor can be be a low mach number since the v is high but so is the temperature since mach number is velocity speed of sound you can be going faster than the speed of sound at sea level but you must specify the temperature and the type of gas the speed of sound at sea level is 760 mph but obviously that changes at altitude and your velocity is always relative velocity so a 200 mph tailwind would have you at 960 mph to break the sound barrier and would change with altitude  would they be able to hit 960 mph if the 787 entered a steep dive say 8 000 fpm or more   just looked at some standard atmosphere tables and at 35 000 ft speed of sound is 660 mph so they only needed to reach 860 mph ground track with a 200 mph tailwind so yes they were close it would be dangerous structurally as with aerodynamic loading we do not care about speed but mach number and reynolds number deals with turbulence and stuff as those actually predict how air will affect surfaces its important to note it would like running 210 mph on a 200 mph train so the a c ground track really doesnt affect anything except how soon the pax arrive  i am sorry i do not speak freedom units on the other side of the iron curtain we calculate it as sqrt gamma r t where t is in glorious kelvin  wasnt an explanation it was a question whole airmass is moving that fast not close to the sound barrier for the airplane itself  thanks sucks to get downvoted for a question guess it was dumb  it is a common misconception not a dumb question at all ground speed vs true airspeed can be kind of hard to wrap your mind around if you are not familiar  just imagine you are running forward on one of those moving walkways at an airport  i am a pilot and was wondering the same thing well student pilot great question though fascinating concept really basically the sound equivalent of warp travel edit ok i worded this carelessly to assuage u lysandersporker of his concerns i understand these concepts just fine and was wondering for maybe 5 seconds before i worked it out however it is still a good question and people should not be discouraged from asking    well to be fair i asked the same question to my high school physics teacher and she gave me the wrong answer be very afraid  it was a very conservative christian school they cared more about the bible than science but still   just read up on it very interesting and makes perfect sense so cool  i gave your original question an upvote to try and help you out lol  respect is it possible for a jet to abruptly exit such an airmass where it would briefly become supersonic  no you are literally being pushed by the wind your tas mach number does not change if your tailwind goes from 200kts to zero all you lose is groundspeed the airplane itself is still flying the same speed  i am pretty sure that is incorrect if the air instantly stopped moving which will not happen your groundspeed would remain the same and your airspeed would increase conservation of momentum this would of course quickly reduce back to the original airspeed this is basically how dynamic soaring works  this is correct you are right i was answering from a more practical sense of losing the tailwind not instantaneous  i think your answer is correct your explanation is wrong if the plane could somehow pass through an invisible wall that would stop the 250 mph tailwind and the plane breaks through into still air its groundspeed would remain the same and it would suddenly be supersonic that is pretty obvious the explanation of why that does not happen is that air nearly never changes speeds that quickly and if you did find that kind of speed gradient the turbulence from the shear would be extremely intense  that makes more sense my only context for this is the jet stream graphic i see next to the weather man how fast would it be going in indicated air speed  honestly i do not pay too much attention to indicated airspeed once we transition to mach but somewhere in the range of 230 260 indicated and mach 77 to 85 for the faster guys  bearing in mind that at such high pressure altitudes and low temperatures the ias could well be a few hundred knots below the eas mach numbers are used at altitude as the tas for exceeding the critical mach number becomes a lot lower as the speed of sound decreases in the cold air  flew from philly to michigan last night at fl340 doing about 290kts over the ground some points with a 200kt direct headwind this morning flying back at fl370 we hit 600 over the ground  actual non amp url  i saw 900 on aa51 today via flightaware something tells me that was not right  please clarify ground speed true airspeed or indicated airspeed  and not use mph looks like it is ground speed and my math has the conversion at 696 kts gs  man i just did 642 kts gs in a 737 last week they should blow that out of the water  801 indicated airspeed would blow the wings off the plane so i think we can rule that one out 801 true airspeed probably has a decent chance of doing that too over mach 1  you probably want to check out  too bad they could not get to 806 700 kts  can someone tell me if the tail winds actually pushes an aircraft like this and if so how if the jet is going 560mph and the speed of the tail winds are 200mph how is the wind doing any pushing if it is slower than the jet granted i am not a pilot or someone who exceeded 2nd level high school math just a guy who enjoys planes for their engineering and power so maybe there is something i am not getting i am just trying to imagine running outside with a slight wind to my back and not feeling like i am getting any positive push unless i am running slower than the wind  think about it like swimming with a current the whole air mass is moving huh never thought of that but it makes perfect sense when thinking about it that way thanks  gorgeous aircraft i can not wait to see what the 777x is like saw a lax to jfk in 4 25 i took a red eye last night lax to ewr 4 35 dang over mach one 787 take that 777 your ge90s suck 777     gt dang over mach one not a real aviator are you the next troll account has arrived at first i thought that this was a virgin v chad post this is over the speed of sound isnt it i thought that was not legal  does not seem impossible i suppose i believe an raf voyager experienced a similar upset after the captain accidentally lodged a camera against the sidestick when shifting the seat  as a former 787 fa operating the seats in the flight deck is part of our training it is a basic to help in case of pilot incapacitation both in order to perform first aid such as chest compressions and also to prevent a pilot having a seizure or similar to push against the controls pedals  i am not saying it is impossible a fa pushed that button upon serving a meal but it seems highly unlikely also given how spacious the flight deck is it is not like on the 737 where you operate 30 buttons with your skull if you do not duck down  as a mechanic that cockpit space makes me so jealous  real i have been in many flight decks when i walked into the 78 flight deck the air was immediately better and cooler and it was so much more spacious mega jealous as a pax the rule usually tends to be the bigger the plane the more it sucks  the a380 is the best plane i ever flew on  some people tend to like when it sucks more i like the way this sucks  if you think you hate it now just wait till you drive it  would the seat ever move fast enough to cause such a sudden change in altitude  that was my thought never have i seen a power seat move so fast you can not counter the impact i can not comprehend how this could result in an control input abrupt enough to create such a violent maneuver smells fishy seems like boeing needs someone to blame or the crew does perhaps there were other activities on the flight deck that caused a sudden control input  i am not a pilot but i would bet dollar1k what happened is the seat moved forward and then after the pilot tried to push it back bracing against the stick thus pushing the nose down i do not want to believe that hah but if the bird brained pilot was sitting cross legged as reported perhaps he kicked the stick accidentally in a panic  you are terrible at betting then it is an electric seat no need to brace against anything at most the manual controls allow you to push the feet with the floor to provide more than enough opposing force  i guess so if the pilot had their knee or another body part directly on the yoke that would for sure cause a control input but i can not really imagine that it would lead to such a violent dive  i am not 787 rated either but on airbus you can apply a slight force on the joystick without disconnecting the ap when it does disconnect it means you have gone over a certain threshold meaning your input onto the stick is already not negligible hence an initial abrupt movement if my theory applies to boeing which i am not sure about and then if the nose down moment was caused by the seat pushing forward and not the leg then the pilots would try to pull up and it would last maybe one second maybe more to realise why they can not they are in the cruise phase hungry and smelling their meal approaching remember during that time the nose down input continues until they realise what blocks the control column and move the seat and pull up from a huge negative pitch of course if the leg was what moved the control column then the affected pilot would know right away and would start moving the seat backwards without the investigation time i was thinking the exact same thing how likely was it that they were doing degenerate and immoral acts inside of that cockpit cause that seems quite likely to me  maybe the fa was jumping on the d of the pilot i have not seen anything yet that made much sense  they flew a plane back across the pacific ocean that had just plunged previously without waiting for the investigation so much sense  i mean that is not fishy they got the fdr and the cvr the plane seems fine and they got the pilots to interview there is no reason to keep the plane in new zealand  i think what they were attempting to say is that if the sudden nose down pitch was caused by something that the pilots could not control it would be a risk to fly that same plane over a large body of water for hours upon hours so maybe either a they the airline knew pretty quick that it was due to pilot commands or b they do not really mind risking and sacrificing crew to get the plane back  i mean once they got the fdr readouts or the crew is statements it must have been obvious that the plane itself was fine over water better than over land amirite  it absolutely is if a fcs failure is suspected lmao  cycled jet stale data gone safe again  just gotta suicide the pilot and fa and we are all good right  i heard it was an issue that had been communicated years ago that they needed to not keep the plane running for a certain number of days or errors like that could occur and then it was fixed in a software upgrade that latam never got the airworthiness directive relating to that does not talk about loss of controls or sudden i commanded control inputs as a potential problem even if the plane is left powered on for 51 days straight it just says certain instruments may show unreliable outputs to the pilots without any indicator that it is invalid  google uncommanded descent b787 stale data can even make the screens freeze  yes except that a shutdown would not cause the plane to go into a dive there would be no input which would let the plane just glide for a bit the theory with the chair makes much more sense and a pilot that fucked up maybe would not own up to that and instead blame the instruments  that seems more likely than blaming it on a flight attendant managers make their living by shifting blame  software problems has to be the answer tbh i seriously never want to get on another boeing plane again  anyone out there have a picture of this button of death any 787 drivers ever move the seat up as far as it can go hopefully while parked seems unlikely to me unless the captain has a big ol beer belly   and  video both show seat movement and the switch in different directions actually does seem to move relatively quick  how the fuck does a flight attendant hit that by accident that is a pretty safe design  my non 787 pilot speculation the pilot made a boneheaded maneuver and pushed on the yoke when trying to slide the seat back  that is my take i am going with pilot induced he did not even address the pax after it happened it was only later that he said my instruments went blank okay pal i do not buy it 30 years in the industry  100percent accurate no announcement was made after the event from the captain other than a harried audio in spanish that i caught medico and i assumed was asking if anyone has medical experience this was not immediate either minutes passed before that was said passengers we are already in the aisle trying to help the injured the flight attendants were mia immediately after as well at least as far as what i could see in the middle cabin  does not the fly by wire programming prevent the maneuvering from roughing the pax  fly by wire protects the airplane which can handle alot the unsecured meatbags in the cabin however they will go flying an airliner can easly pull 3 4g is and probably 1g which when unsecured will send you hugging the ceiling and when the pilot then goes oh shit and pulls out of the dive you come slaming down at 2 3 times gravity keep your seatbelts on if uncomfortable loosen them a bit but not as much so you could slide out if newton decides to yank you upwards  unsecured meatbags is the name of my new grindcore outfit come through we are playing franklin is basement this friday night for real though i always ask how do you think it would go if someone held you by your ankles off an upper floor balcony and dropped you onto pavement basically the same physics at play as a widebody hitting any significan not negative gs  i am going with meatbag defenestration thanks for the explanation scary stuff  this would not have happened with an airbus side stick s airbus sidesticks only get jammed by misplaced cameras  or af pilots do not tell me some bonehead left a camera near the stick and hindering it is movement    raf as well that is just stupid  has it btw  see above replies about cameras jamming the airbus side sticks  excellent question even if the cover was broken missing that switch is pretty inset there is also another switch on the side for the pilot to use while they are seated    yeah she is pretty filthy mate  gt that is a pretty safe design it is not you need to lift the cover to move the seat backwards and just press the cover to move it forwards   which is why it is safe   absolutely not safe just touching the cover moves the seat forward  ok that one clip is sped up that move as slow as i would expect  neither of those show what we are talking about we need to see how to move the seat forward let is say the pilot uses the switch in those videos to move the seat back then the pilot sits down how do they move the seat forward from the seated position  you did not watch the second video then 787 driver here the seat does not move that fast i do not buy this story i am trying to imagine a scenario where i or anyone else would be up that tight on the yoke that an inadvertent activation of that switch would cause this and it just does not seem likely the seat moves faster in manual mode via the levers on the side of the seat with their use the seat slides freely along the tracks  as per my previous comment what if you were sitting cross legged  the second the seat starts moving you would say something and it would stop it requires a decent amount of force to push through the autopilot control and disengage it via yoke movement plausible yes likely i do not think so  and even if a tray was caught against the yoke and the button got stuck on stay with me are the flight controls that sensitive that pushing the stick forward at that speed would violently snap the nose down or once the stick is pushed beyond the autopilot resistance would it snap down like that really can not believe they are blaming a power seat here  there is a bit of a jolt associated with the override when you forcefully push through the servos but i can not see it violently nosing the aircraft over this is all speculation on my behalf mind you but it just does not really make a lot of sense to me  assuming auto pilot is on what does the yoke do when pushed forward for much resistance would there be whole thing seems strange and seems like pilot will be to blame with available info at the moment edit i see you answered below thanks the button in question is directly behind the headrest and another with the same function is on the side left in pilots case right on first officers seat i believe edited because i misread switch cover for seat cover   from chilean press in spanish quotes some of the incident report a flight attendant stewardess visiting the cockpit to serve them food rested her elbow on the cover of the switch that electrically moves the seat to store it the seat proceeded to move forward pushing the captain against the joystick as he was apparently sitting cross legged when the lever was pressed the autopilot ap was disconnected and a brief nosedive began  ah so cross legged was the issue cause the seats have a cut in them which allows for them to slide way forward literally into the stick very surprised the button was able to be actuated through the plastic cover they are fairly stout  does the ap back drive the column wheel on the 87 if so it all makes sense the relatively slow motorized seat pushing into the column by way of crossed legs the ap servos initially resisting the motion allowing the force to build up like a spring and then when the ap force override logic tripped and disconnected the ap the column slammed forward rapidly and everyone went for a ride  is the implication then that the pilots are lying how much trouble are they in  if the cover was damaged or somehow misaligned improperly installed as appears to be the case in the linked video the seat could have kept moving when she removed her elbow it is plausible that it would take a couple seconds for everyone to process what was happening and correct it  seat cover  oh i see i misread switch cover not seat cover i think itd be impossible to hit the rear switch on accident because of that hinged cover but the left side switch is open  very unlikely 787 mech  i am a big dude i have had seat full in i would not have hit the autopilot disconnect i have worked behind the screens  the autopilot backdrove to disengage takes a fair amount of force   gt technical even during the flight which caused strong movement what a way to rebrand that experience like the firearm discharged during officer involved shooting  boeing is very good at reframing like a door plug falling off became a quality escape do they teach that at bean counter school  haha good one but actually in manufacturing it is actually called a quality escape aka an issue that escaped quality checks  boeing did not frame anything latam did and quality escape is an official term we issue or receive depending on where the escape is discovered noe is or notice of escapement except in this case it was the airline who blamed a technical event to distract from the mistakes of their own employees there is a ditch the plane switch right above where the food tray goes  reminds me of my favorite old far side cartoon  i thought it was going to be this one  i feel like there was a far side comic to this effect but i can not find it 2 minutes apart one of those nice reddit moments   were not people quoted as saying the pilot told them all the screens went black blank also how fast does that seat move to be able to cause an issue without it being caught first i know how slow the electric seat moves forward and back in my truck and its pretty slow  there was one passenger saying that some obvious possibilities  the passenger lied for attention the pilot explained badly or the passenger misunderstood passengers are not known for giving accurate testimony about aviation  there is the possibility that a language barrier was an issue here one report mentions that the pilot was speaking to passengers in spanish the passenger was interviewed in english and it is not clear how strong the passenger is spanish is or how strong is the pilot is english the pilot lied to the passenger r flying leads me to believe that pilots lie to passengers frequently we sugarcoat and water down things because people do not care and frankly do not always need to know this is not wildly different than any other technical field with a large public interaction component  it is not hard for me to believe that the pilot lied about a mistake to avoid being yelled at by a bunch of upset passengers  i am pretty sure by law they have to have announcements in english for this exact reason  vast majority of the announcements throughout the flight were in spanish sometimes there was an attempt made at english though usually either very halting or carefully spoken after the event there was a harried announcement in spanish that i caught the word medico i assume they were asking for people with medical experience no follow up was given in english until almost time to land  the question i have still not seen asked nor answered is what was the pilot doing out of the cockpit talking the passengers right after an incident like that  i am guessing they were back in the cabin to assess the damage and injuries but good point on leaving the cockpit of a potentially broken plane  he did not come to the cabin until after landing and after the medical crews were on board  the pilot came back to the cabin after landing and after the medical crews were onboard  oh you did not know all the screens went blank is what pilots say instead of life flashed before my eyes  posted a video to another comment it is not lightning fast if you are already pretty close then it might not take much to start running out of room  if you were slammed forward you probably can not see the screens so they might as well as been blank lol yeah i am wondering about this but the seat also could have malfunctioned i remember one incident in which the seat lock broke and the captain fell backwards so maybe the seat was broken but we only found out when the switch was pressed still can not reconcile the different testimonies tho  i had a look at the qrh the other night and it mentions if all the displays blank first thing to do is ensure the autopilot is in basic modes eg heading and alt then it gets you to reset the ccr is i am wondering if the there has been some sort of systems failure leading to the ccr is rebooting and that is what caused the pitch down as it would have been in lnav vnav  they mention there was a cover i guess this either means it was broken or the flight attendant made a terrible choice  the cover is the article remember the pilot saying screens shut off and they lost control in previous quote so this doesnt line up  that is just a rumor   while serving a meal yeah right  need to blow the autopilot  ding ding cowgirl position would have done the trick  so glad i was not the only one thinking this i had to keep scrolling way down jesus christ can you imagine babies being thrown into the ceiling cause the pilot was getting some tail the circle of life was the pilots name otto  otto fellatio is there any chance otto pilot was getting re inflated  just as an update cc bgg the aircraft involved returned to service yesterday in a commercial flight to miami  not sure i buy the fa hitting the switch thing but it has been pretty obvious since the beginning that this was in some way caused by events on the flight deck  the seat does not move that fast this does not make any sense that would be such a slow motion catastrophe  we know time moves faster further away from the earth maybe that is a clue  those electric seats are painfully slow and the back electric switch is covered i do not buy it  it is obvious the captain was clapping the fa is cheeks in the cockpit she was definitely serving that meal  if this turns out to be true and she was injured as a result hard to feel anything except she deserves it the pilot too odd he did not address them after recovery ashamed so many pax hurt  i literally read this book last week airframe by michael crichton  why do planes not have an interrupt or stick shaker safety mechanism for inputs outside of a normal flight there is not a lot of scenarios where a pilot would command an extended full nose down there should be some stopper in the system for stuff like that commanding a full stall extended extremely steep bank etc  this always seems to happen that the first bit of investigation leak results always happens to blame the pilot before the real analysis is complete not saying that is not possible though this explanation is pretty unlikely imo but it was done with both 737 max investigations before boeing admitted they were at fault  was the attendant trying to sit on the pilot is lap  as others of said i am guessing the pilot made a mistake trying to adjust the seat and accidentally pushed hard on the yoke not sure that i buy it the captain made mention that they momentarily lost all of their instrumentation i am a us pilot at a major airline however i will also caveat that i have never flown the 787 here is the av herald link check out the airworthiness directive put out by the faa about this years ago   i do not buy it can not accidentally lean on it because it has a cover you flip up it also does not move at the speed of light does not mean the cover was actually there it is a piece of plastic i wonder if it was missing  how does moving the seat explain an uncontrolled dive if the fa moved the seat forward and the pilot pushed the control yoke forward putting the aircraft into a nose down movement how would they not just be able to pull it back that does not make any sense maybe his leg was between the seat and the control when it moved forwards could have been hard to get it unstuck that would make sense if the rumor that the pilot was sitting cross legged is true  uh they did did not the passengers say it lasted only a few seconds  correct i did not have a timer going obviously but i would guess 2 3 seconds total felt like forever but it was so quick there was little time to react or compensate before leveling off  this is going to be the first safety report in aviation with the term reverse cowboy in it  i used to have this acura where i got a quarter stuck in the seat rail and it caused it to move around until i dislodged it that is the first thing i thought of  such an accident is not possible on a glorious airbus imagine not having a sidestick in current year  is it me or flight shame about to get replaced by legitimate terror to fly in a boeing plane  im thinking this was sex related   on the other hand a pilot could be taking heat off himself and crew as well  this kinda seems more likely to me the event cascade considering all the redundancies in aircraft for every single screen to go blank and have an aircraft maneuver hard enough to cause injuries is pretty steep not a 787 mech though so that is just my speculation until we know more  but why lie when you know you are going to be found out in a follow up investigation it just makes it worse also the fact a pilot would knowingly lie about something so serious is a bit unsettling to be fair we do not know of the pilot lied or even said anything at all all we have is the media saying a passenger said the pilot said so and so  that is a good point does that make it worse lying to investigators would be one thing if lying to passengers is a crime there is a whole lot of pilots who ought to be worried  so the screens going blank for a moment was bs  its was bs from the moment it was said but the media knew people would eat that up to hear another problem with boeing fear their airplanes  was otto pilot at the stick  meanwhile  hahaha i knew it sounds like boeing damage control bs you know like murdering a whistleblower  delusional nah it is going to be stale data related  boeing publicly blaming crew during an active investigation that must be a first welp this post is clearly a boeing blogger bot  trying not to make it sound like a boeing problem the people that built it already said it was garbage  wow these seems like a stretch and even if true wow what a design flaw  why is there a death plummet button that is easily bumped because boeing  ahhh human factors yes let is put the button which can lead to loss of control of the plane right here were it can be actuated accidentally  lol i saw a video of it being operated and it has a cover over the switch you have to lift up then you can push the switch to the side to make the seat move so maybe the cover was broken and missing or something  i think that is my personal record for downvotes  it is possible a special livery was applied that is being kept wrapped up for an official unveiling or they had to re do the tail section only and masked off the rest but they would typically remove all that stuff in the paint shops and they typically use a sort of paper based masking product instead of all plastic or the fuselage has been stripped of all coatings but it needs to spend some time outside so they covered up all the exposed fuselage from uv damage  good points although it looks like it never got any kind of special livery i think your last point may be the most likely it did not leave everett for 4 months until it was given over to aa  it does look like they only covered up the solid white part while leaving the tail which has the extra red and blue exposed not sure why but i am guessing there was something different about the solid white section maybe one less layer to paint or maybe they wanted to mask off the solid white while painting the tail livery  the solid white is an extremely strong coating that will completely protect the plane  airplane paint is extremely tough and durable it is way thicker and tougher than automotive paint  the black tape is exactly in line with the livery on the tail pretty sure they are either treating or waiting for the unveil they could also be waiting for lawyers to approve if there is a 787 in everett it is there for rework so when they paint they only painted the worked spot source i work there intersting this was taken back in april 2022 did that still apply back then  they have been doing the 47 48 section rework since 2021so it is pretty likely  if it did not leave for 4 months then that is probably for protection especially from the kind of hail and wind washington state can get plastic wrapping it like that is probably cheaper than the maintainence on 4 months of damage from exposure to the elements even if it is only partial and they still need to touch up the coating on the tail and wings it probably also insulates the interior and limits the need to heat the plane to prevent freezing  i wonder what the full cost to do that would be  the plane is now in service and it has the standard aa livery so it was likely the 4th point you can also see that the exposed engine is in a white color while the normal aa 787 livery has the entire body including the engines in a gray color the 787 is made of carbon fiber which they do not like to keep out in the sun exposed movement of 787s happens at night when they are being built to protect against the sun but since this plane needed to be out in the day they likely slapped a protective white coat of paint on the engines while wrapping the body which presumably still needed to be painted to protect the carbon fiber  2022 lots of planes were delayed in delivery due to covid lots of planes were put into short term storage covered up any and all possible places that could get water or any damage chs was overrun with 787 is awaiting delivery and there were no empty spaces anywhere on the boeing ramp  bedbugs probably  this it was fogged inside interesting thread so many responses no correct answers it most likely does not have an interior installed and is destined for very long term storage they wrap the entire fuselage because it is quick and easy and ensures the wrap stays put they used to tape a stip of plastic over the windows but that proved to be a maintenance nightmare the reason the windows must be covered is because there are no physical window shades especially if the interior is not there and sunlight will send in uv rays and eat any exposed carbon fiber without the interior it is all exposed no protective paint so this guy looks to be going to sit for a bit but not for too long since the engines are still there or the order to storage came late and the engines will be removed in position on the flight line  i have very close contact with the 787 program the uv exposure issue can manifest even during a move of the unfinished fuselage between buildings this is only done at night when the composite fuselage us bare  so no jedi pilot training dang so the carbon fiber resin composites are only good with a coat of paint  yep i remember when they started freaking out when we parked the development aircraft outside during moves then 10 to 22 sat gutted for a number of years a lot of lessons were learned about proper care and storage of 787s  wonder if the titan hull had the same precautions taken as far as limiting uv exposure  that is scary af the fuselage is primed which is the corrosion protection layer the top coat is only to protect that and to look good most likely a special livery or some kind of test  this is a 787 so no corrosion inhibitor on aluminum airplanes the coating is alodine which is light green but a factory fresh 787 should be white when it leaves the factory with no livery the factory paint is to protect the joints and fasteners exactly as you say  the bolt still can corrode they are the same same a conventional fuselage  there are surprisingly few exposed bolts on the 8 there were a ton which was really stupid and this was changed with the subsequent models still no cic or primer there is a uv protection coating on the cfrp that is why they are a tan grey color when unpainted otherwise they would be black without paint  fasteners installed in composite material have special coating requirements they do not go back and paint each one after installing them unlike in fuel tanks where everything gets cap sealed the 787 is made of carbon fibre it begins to break down in direct sunlight without anything protecting it  when i was building these planes in charleston all the sub assembly moves were done at night to protect the carbon fibre when a suprise line move happened during daylight we all had to get out a brush and slop a quick layer of white base paint on it so it could be rolled across the street  sidenote i do not know what kind of paint it is but man is it durable i dripped a little on a pair of shoes and now today 10 years later the shoes are a worn wreck but those drips look brand new  which explains why they have not wrapped the aa tail livery as it looks like that is some sort of plastic wrap  i work close to the 787 program can confirm 787 fuselages only move at night due to uv exposure accumulation  787s are confirmed to be vampires  carbon fiber carbon fiber reinforced plastic it is for ifr training for both pilots and passengers ifr taxiing would be especially challenging  garmin with synthetic vision lol you just have to do it by feel that felt like a blue light  special on taxiway golf  that felt like a truck  whoops there is the ils array  ah yes let is play airside braille  marco  i feel like i am using a lot more thrust than normal smgcs  i am tired of all these msfs passengers on this msfs plane  sorry yo ask can you please eli5 what this means  i think it is a joke ifr or instrument flight rules flying is where navigation is done by reference to instruments only this contrasts with vfr or visual flight rules flying where pilotage navigation by reference to visual landmarks is the norm during training for ifr flight students will often wear some kind of view limiting device such as frosted over safety glasses to limit how much of the world outside the cockpit can be seen this allows ifr training to be conducted in good weather this business of wrapping the entire plane would be an ultimate view limiting device and would apply to passengers as well as pilots  ifr instrument flight rules the opposite of vfr visual required to be able to fly through clouds and situations where you need to rely on instruments and not what you can see they are joking that it could be used for ifr training because all the windows are covered  vfr visual flight rules you need to be able to see where you are going you can not fly into clouds and you are responsible for keeping away from other aircraft you do not need a flight plan and you do not need to talk to atc unless you are going through a controlled sector such as near a major airport ifr instrument flight rules you are using only instruments to fly the plane you do not need to see where you are going you can fly in any safe weather conditions you always have a flight plan and you will be talking to atc the whole time they will tell you where to go and are responsible for keeping you away from other aircraft airline flights always use ifr  lol they did not want another unexpected baby dreamliner to appear  so like a crj  that is a bad dream it is a stealth coating they can not see you kicking off passengers if they can not see the airplane termites solved  or bed bugs or walter white jesse it is time to cook  wow  todd really does a good job does not he  they are cooking meth inside  pretty clever  funny fumigation was my first thought too  same had bed bugs on the mind until i realized they did not cover the back door and there is zero reason to covered the entire otherwise airtight plane body to fumigate unless the bed bugs busted out the windows too  phil swift is corporate jet covered with flex tape he sawed this plane in half  now that is a lot of damage   but will it even work underwooter  the flex tape corporate jet looks more or less like a spy plane alright this comment wins wraps are so in right now fwiw they have been looking at wraps adhered polymer films to replace paint for a long time afaik without a lot of success so far  i would guess that wraps have a problem actually staying on the plane given the airspeeds involved  frontier uses wraps for the animals on the the tail their older ones their newer ones seems to be lasting longer but still have an  a lot of them are still new wraps so we will see as time goes on  from my understanding i have not looked at this part of the market in a while getting it to stick is easy at first having it last as long in the extreme conditions high uv extreme fast temperature swings etc shortens the service life amp costs to make them worse than paint so far what is really being sought in some corners is a substrate for adaptive camouflage which of course will turn into civil airplanes being flying billboards and private ones as platforms for ego artwork even more than they are now god help us if it gets as far as curved screen led  then where is my mcdonald is crispy chicken wrap  air new zealand cosplay you beat me to it  do not want a bunch of unplanned baby 787s running

return to the terminal for processing you have won a prize  protection they do not want it running off and coming back with 12 kids that sound suspiciously like an airbus a320 coming in to land  damnit that gave me a good laugh airplanes can wear gimp suits too  all it took was one windy day with the airplane being tied down and suddenly a new fetish was unlocked next boeing is going to start

practicing safe sex because it is not ready to have the responsibility of a bunch of smaller planes flying around  perhaps they are trying to hide the fact it is owned by american   this airplane required work to be performed that necessitated a change to the standard flow of our paint operations the airplane was covered temporarily while it waited to begin the final stage of its paint cycle the final elements of painting this airplane are now underway it is standard practice to cover unpainted areas if schedules require temporary storage outside before the application of paint is

 no fuzzy dice  sadly not pine tree air freshener would be sufficient  like  or  you know the airlines is luxurious when the cockpit has fuzzy seats it is actually the boeing prototype version production model seats are still pretty comfy i can not remember if they are fuzzy or not  yes sheepskin it is lovely  fart absorbers what is that switch on the right do  eject button which one  that one sucks the chemtrails back in then burps  next to the wings fall off switch  makes the front fall off museum of flight pavilion in seattle  yep with the flaps out and the speed brakes full open reversers to max  someone really jacked up their after landing flow  were getting closer to the ship that goes to fhloston paradise corbinnnn dallasssss bzzzzzzzzzz  what causes the design decision for the fuzzy seats the f 16 has it also right will not it just make it harder to clean and trap dirt and debris or is there some kind of comfort enhancement like increase asscrack airflow  which button for the 30mm rotary cannon  why are the pilot is seats fuzzy  sheepskin is neither too hot nor too cold  fuzzy comfy in addition to temperature benefits i believe sheepskin wool seats dampen vibrations and reduce fatigue  what are the purple viewfinder looking things are they smart displays  huds they are sights for the 20mm vulcan i would recognize that view any day hope you had a good visit to the museum  i sure did lot simpler than i had imagined  can read the upper panel pretty good i noticed it was through glass a polarizing filter will cancel that great pictures  my god she is sexy best cockpit i have ever worked in nice very nice flight deck big displays after seeing the the 737ng screens look tiny  r cozyplaces flight engineer  there have not been new planes built with fes in 5 decades that is a jump seat  thats what i assumed just didnt think jump seats were in the cockpit  where did you think they were on the wings  would be the easiest for jumping right  math checks out  the smart seat is wall mounted gross no recline so simple so easy it takes like 3 switches to start the engine anyone can fly these nowadays  yep once you have prepped power and the fuel pumps all you need to hit is the starter engine and fuel run pretty much  it is actually just two starter and fuel control  was counting the battery switch lol  i mean if you want to count that you might as well count the rest of the checklist but sure that does indeed need to be on lol potato camera you must have a better picture then  no it is looks dusty in there it is the third prototype aircraft and sits on display at the museum of flight the cockpit protected by a glass screen  well that splains it sorry if i came off as snarky there are 2 ways to ask a question with or without a veiled insult your reaction was justified maybe this person needs to learn how to be a little polite  hey no problem i should not have insulted your camera i see the feelings police showed up we did not need him we handled the intense situation s my favorite plane to fly on microsoft flight simulator 2020 um ok maybe the only plane i can fly too  i want to touch it that is so spacious pilots need longer arms to operate all the controls  do they do a version with leather seats and a walnut dash  i have always wondered how comfortable are pilots seats can any pilot here answer thank you  i make them and can confirm they are very comfy  r guessthecockpit does it have that new car smell  there is a neat 3d tour of the cockpit and crew rest area of this very 787  very cool i assume you got to your destination early because of the tailwind  yeah we typically have to slow down on this leg syd sfo bc we run about an hour early customs does not open until 0600 and waiting at the gate is never fun  i see also is cruising at fl 410 common i have never been on a flight with cruising altitude that high  in the 787 it is normal lower on long legs is unusual ceiling is fl430 and we fly it there too no issues  i have yet to fly on the 787 i need to do it someday have flown mostly on the 777 especially for long haul edit or the 777x when it enters service  the 787 is a whole different animal electric pressurization electric de ice so it quiet and the air is humidified and the cabin is lower altitude it is all around nicer people say the 777 is better to fly but i do not know cause i am not typed on it  i would imagine the 787 would be more comfortable due to the fact that it is pressurised to a lower altitude it probably helps pilots out too  lots more comfortable for us whisper quiet lowers fatigue  wow this is my first time having a conversation with a pilot of a commercial airliner my respects to you and all other pilots out there  thank you you can check out my podcast if you wanna learn more about me and just be entertained touch your platform and give it a listen start with 2 or 5 they are funny   can confirm took 787 from paris to la cheap seats and took 777 from dubai to san fran business class  love the 787 feel  can confirm here as well i flew on the 787 from san francisco to heathrow and it was a dream but i deeply regret not choosing an a380 now that they are being retired whoa til never flown on a 787 before mostly older models long haul nonstop 777 flights and damn i never had really any issues per se but i always thought the feeling of flying could be helped at least a little huh    i have done bos osl and lgw bos on a 787 best flights i have ever taken    yes it uses electric powered cabin air compressors to provide pressurization to the air cycle machines it also has electric starter generators and you can start both at the same time this machine has 6 generators each putting out the same amount of power as those huge hospital backup generators that are in shipping containers if all 6 generators were online and pumping at 100percent the 787 could supply enough power for a small town with businesses and about 800 household at peak power usage this thing is a marvel  man what a machine future ame here hoping to get a type certificate on that thing one day  the earlier fins were not quiet the lower recirc fans were so loud sometimes you would just forget to switch it on    no it is not the same one the two are similar but the systems are way to different    yes this is accurate  meanwhile i have never flown in a wide body plane  i see gulfstreams at fl430 fl450 and surprised me me the big guys do not go up there more  most of the time corporates are not operating at gross since our mission is not to pack the jet and move as much paying cargo self loading or otherwise as possible from a to b that said even full of gas and operating at gross we typically climb straight to fl400 or fl410 depending on direction of flight and we step up from there as we burn down i do not think very many airliners are certified above fl430 and most airliners 787 excepted very rarely operate light enough to get even that high an empty airliner is losing money at a staggering rate the g iii and g iv are certified to fl450 and everything after that is certified to fl510 we rarely get to 51 as you have to be really light like less fuel on board than we typically land with on a beautiful vmc day you can occasionally get there at the end of a really long leg where you are stretching the range and are over somewhere with lots of good alternates with good weather or in the tropics where the tropopause is so high that the temp aloft approaches 80c but again only if we are light  the 787 can typically climb directly to fl400 or fl410 at max gross it is got big engines with so much thrust that we cruise around at 85percent power at mach 84 also it is not accurate to say that large airliners burn a whole lot of fuel this airplane mid weight going 85 will burn roughly 9k pph total i flew a 787 9 from sydney to sfo loaded with ppe and it was light and saw burns dip into the 8k range again for both engines combined i am typed in lots of gulfstreams and i remember the 4 burning around 3 5k at slower speed this airplane can carry 330 ppl and 10s of thousands of pounds of cargo for less than 3 times the fuel burn also maintenance costs are incredibly low due to high use programs this shocked me when i jumped from corporate to airline these things are smooth fast and incredibly efficient  that is actually pretty insane quite the machine the 650 is 2 5k 3k at mid weights at 90 but not with 330 pax and 10 tons of ld3s thanks for the perspective    we do not always insert the decimal it is assumed  it is a lead in to the speed check copypasta   center say speed 25 250 kts but you are probably more accurate than we are  thanks  i fly an airline jet and we can not really get to those altitudes the planes are packed too heavy the certified max altitude in my plane is fl410 but we more commonly fly at fl350 fl370 when i used to fly to brazil i want to say there never broke fl335 which really surprised me but now that you mention weight that makes sense i want to say they were usually 767 is  i have family in brazil so i travel from the us to brazil a lot usually they step climb over the duration of the flight so they will be around fl310 when i fall asleep but i often wake up to the plane up at fl390 or higher  wait you could actually sleep  if i was not shivering from coldness there was always some reason i could not sleep and if i did it was on the hop from sp to gig 45 minute  i have gotten the nice lay flat seats with a blanket a pretty good number of times going to sao paulo since we are always going down to see family and have no real agenda we try to plan trips around times when there are lots of open seats or open first class one time i was the only person out of 25 first class seats the flight attendant just gave me a bottle of wine and told me to ring the call bell if i needed anything else so she did not have to keep getting up  first time i flew on the 787 i was surprised to hear the pilot announce we were at 40 000 feet  smooth as silk   i will bite what about this tells you that there is a tailwind  super curious top left of the heads up display there is an arrow pointing up with 48 next to it it shows the direction the wind is going towards also bottom left all the picture right in the corner there is the same arrow or at least half of it and you can make out 24x 48 which is consistent with the display on the hud showing that the wind is coming from heading 24x so towards 60 or so at 48 knots hope this helps  that is awesome thanks for the info  there is an arrow pointing up on the upper left of the hud that is the wind direction looks like a 48 knot tail wind  i am curious is the tailwind on the hud  yea top left found it thank you   gt very cool i assume you got to your destination early because of the tailwind  how did you know where op was flying or that they reached early because of tailwind i know nothing about aviation but wondering how you figured that out by looking at the photo  what tailwinds do is increase an aircraft is ground speed gs which is speed relative to the ground not only does flying in a tailwind help aircraft arrive faster but it also reduces fuel consumption and engine wear since the engines do not have to work as hard to achieve a high gs fun fact on feb 9 2020 a british airways 747 400 broke the record for fastest subsonic transatlantic flight new york to london thanks to a jetstream providing tailwinds gt 200 mph the flight reached a top gs of 825 mph and the journey was completed in 4 hrs 56 mins sadly british airways retired its queen of the skies fleet in july 2020  i like your username p haha thanks i was deciding what username to use and i thought cockpit sounds so i just went for it  hello from brand a  a350  fight fight fight  why take the bus when you can fly the dream  but the bus has footrests and a dinner table yokes are a joke   flew the queen before the 350 i gotta love boeing for the simplicity and the tank like build of the 400 but the ergonomics of the bus is just something else no clue about the 787  never flown a bus but i have been in the 74 4 sim a fair bit chuck you in a 78 you would figure it out quick enough bigger screens fly by wire that makes you look good and the hud ergonomics wise about the same  wow both of you are on same speed and same altitude  that is some pretty good tailwind you got there  looks very similar the last boeing i flew was a 747 from memory it was very very different compared to the bus so i had to completely throw out that knowledge to learn flying the bus i am surprised how much of it came back when i saw your picture  i have heard this i am not typed on the bus  superimposed on the windshield i hate that with the 787 hud i have hit my head on it so many times in cruise i would often throw it up because unless your sitting in the perfect position its useless 1 for airbus it is not the photo is just taken closer to the display unit than ops picture we also do not use it in the cruise we stow it passing 15000 going up and deploy it tod seems like another nice little creature comfort design by airbus from what i have seen they really seem to pay attention to that sort of stuff  that is so beautiful they can not call it an artificial horizon anymore  fun fact the horizon on the hud is above the real horizon due to the curvature of the earth at fl410  yep theirs a note for it during training there is  grammar mistakes aside that is actually pretty interesting  guidance is called a flight path vector and the line is just zero degrees pitch it is the horizon still kinda lol in our airplane its called the zero path reference line you put the plane on that line and it will not climb nor will it descend  at 40 000 feet how close to stall speed is 250 knots  we are not close at all it is actually right there on the speed tape the max speed is denoted by the blocks up top that show around 280 or so and the low speed stall is not shown on bottom bc it is actually off the tape you do see the beginning of the caution band starting down there but actual stalk is really low bc this wing is just that good if i wanted to look it up i could tell you precisely but trust it is no where even close to where you would fly  it is hard to say for safety reasons and because weight can vary quite a lot airliners do not typically list a stall speed nor do pilots ever operate the aircraft with a stall speed in mind depending on the operator what you will usually see described is something like a minimum maneuvering speed which is 10 25percent higher than the actual calculated stall speed since we are just after a rough estimate here we can go by the vref value of 137 knots listed on the hud this is the final over the fence landing speed in the landing configuration at landing weight some carriers calculate vref as 1 25x the actual stall speed i will let you run the numbers on that but we can safely say that 250 knots is 100 knots over stall speed fl410 is high but not quite that high where you experience the coffin corner effect that you might at higher altitudes  and here the mmo is shown by the blocks at the top of the tape it is around mach 89 or 90 we regularly fly these around 88 i can not speak for a 787 but in my jet the shaker will go off around 200 knots at that altitude it varies a little with different weather conditions but the low speed cue is usually near 200  he has transitioned to mach instead of knots and is doing 84 mach honestly probably closer to a high speed stall then anything else   gt high speed stall  huh i had no idea this was a thing interesting and scary  what is the 252 number on the left     airspeed  indicated airspeed ias is the airspeed read directly from the airspeed indicator asi on an aircraft driven by the pitot static system it uses the difference between total pressure and static pressure provided by the system to either mechanically or electronically measure dynamic pressure the dynamic pressure includes terms for both density and airspeed since the airspeed indicator cannot know the density it is by design calibrated to assume the sea level standard atmospheric density when calculating airspeed   op can reply delete to delete  what is the point of displaying knots at cruise level  it is still useful data and it is a better trend reference then the decimal mach indicator when doing oceanic crossings atc will assign a mach number to fly for procedural separation in aircraft i have flown once at altitude i could set my airspeed indicator to display knots true vs indicated which was a better reference and trend to help maintain a designated mach without auto throttles  thanks for sharing i find the cockpit displays fascinating i have had to program simulated huds that ran off of real time telemetry as part of the rdt amp e process these are done so that flight test engineers can see the data on the ground in a similar format to what the pilot sees we have a whole human factors group that analyzes the psychological perspective of display readability i miss the old days when passengers could visit the cockpit with pilot permission of course  why are commercial huds so cluttered  i agree but do not have an answer there is a de clutter mode but no one uses it bc it just gets rid of the instrument lines and leaves a lot of floating numbers  ah bad design then also maybe stupid question but why is the std pressure set at 3010  not a stupid question it is set to std for operations above the transition altitude and 30 10 is actually on standby that means we have gotten the pressure of our landing field and preset it when we hit the center of the set knob it will toggle from std to 30 10inhg this would happen at 18 000 assuming we are using standard transition level which we are here  thanks for answering does it automatically switch through 18k or do you manually do it or can you program it to switch at a certain altitude or fl if you are flying outside north america  it does not switch automatically but it turns from green to another color i forget what color and it somehow knows the transition level no matter where you are gets it from the chart database pure magic   ah yes pfm lol if you fuck up and switch too early then are given a lower level off alt the plane will actually use the appropriate altimeter setting took me a minute to figure that one out when the plane leveled off at 4300 out of lhr instead of 4000  it actually gets it from the descent winds page which you can change from the defaults if you need to  the 787 also compares the wind on the flight plan to the track gps correction angles and gps ground speed it is a composite it is very smart  i was going to ask the same assumed standby interesting they do not denote the baro setting in use more obviously such as with a rectangle around it or something similar  i agree but the one in use is the large one and the standby setting will only appear once you set it meaning once you climb up and hit the std button it disappears until you set it on the other end and bring it back  understood i guess it is just a boeing thing  boeing likes to do their own thing which i hate but it is what it is  on selecting it the active setting will have a bold box around it for i think 10 seconds and will then go to this version to be honest there are so strict procedures around altimeter settings with the aircraft also aware which setting qnh altimeter or std it should be on the odds of being incorrectly set are slim and if one of you miss set it the aircraft will rather promptly inform you of a baro disagreement  and in fact you can see the baro knob on the bottom left there and if you look closely the center of the knob says std and is actually the toggle button mentioned in last comment  here is cluttered c130j hud  whoof is it de clutterable  yeah it is got a couple of layers of declutter this is usually everything people use enroute though holy shit what a picture though wow is that cluttered to you i feel like that has the minimum amount of information that i would want without having to look down  i have flown lots of other hud systems specifically gulfstream and this feels cluttered and clunky gulfstream does a better job of presenting the data but yes it is all there  what is funny is that the gulfstream and boeing huds are produced by the same supplier blame the oem specs  we make more than just boeing and gulfstream too funny you say that i like this presentation much better than the gac evs ii round dials different strokes hah though i will keep my conformal cdi  seems like a weird oversight not to spend a little extra on ui to get the hud display layout nailed   gt weird oversight ah the boeing corporate motto trying to find traffic in this thing without an ai radar looks like a nightmare how do huds like this work like how do we have transparent screens that display info i always imagine behind most screens there is plenty of wiring so idk what communicates to individual pixels  that they need to light up here  it is cast onto a special piece of glass by a projector above your head  ah that makes more sense thanks  it is a neat thing and special glass in a way a fancy projector special part is how it bounces back to the eyeball it is focused at infinity the eye can read the numbers while keeping focused on the horizon because as far as the eye is concerned the numbers are on the horizon miles away    oh wow i did not realize that i will need to do some digging into how wiring that is only at the edges of the screen can communicate with things in the middle of the screen  dear diary today op was cool do you find yourself becoming too dependent on the fpv especially during landings when i starting simming i used it and now i can not stop no the fpv disappears around 80 feet and forces us to hand fly unless it is on autoland it does not provide a flare cue either unlike some other systems    once per month as required by maintenance nobody wants to autoland bc landing is the best part  sunrises on a dreamliner are both a blessing and a curse while it looks beautiful the window tint does not block the sunlight if it gets in your eyes  oh man you really get blasted that is for sure  yeah it sucks my first flight on a 787 was an overnight to london and i got my eyes blasted by the sun and the window tint could not block all of it some things are best left unchanged imo  is the airspeed tape on the left in m s if so why use that instead of knots  no that is knots actual mach speed is noted at bottom while desired is above the tape  250 m s roughly equals 480kts i would wager a guess and say that would be far too fast on the 787  it would under all circumstances and 480kts indicated would be well over mach 1 at 41 000 about 950kts true air speed so yeah it is knots indicated  knots indicated makes so much more sense now true would be much higher duh right  i am assuming you are not in us airspace yet i have never actually considered the rvsm rules in other countries transoceanic or if it exists is mach number unrestricted below 1 0  depends where you are most places you just fly what you filed  that is pretty sweet who do you fly for  united it says the flight number is ual870 on the bottom right of the photo  so can somebody explain why the mach number is so high with them only going 250 knots  they are going 250 knots indicated not 250 knots true airspeed so you need to correct for the change in density at higher altitudes to get from kias to ktas also the speed of sound depends on temperature and the adiabatic index and you can imagine it gets much colder up at fl410 so the speed of sound is much lower therefore they can achieve transonic mach numbers without a high kias value  yes it is called true airspeed you can look it up  so qwispy  is this qantas or united amazing photo absolutely love it  united  thank you   ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking it is going to be a beautiful day  miss that view damn this covid 19 mess  is this real life  100percent right out of my phone no filter  it looks so much like a photoshopped ad for this device where the real thing is not near as impressive that looks incredible  i thought it was just fantasy the horizon is not at eye level proving the earth is not flat  i still can not tell if this is real or if it is msfs  real what sim  no sim my man  i know nice photo  wow this is pretty cool the coloring looks surreal  wow this is awesome  what is the use of this device  allows you to have all the information available while also keeping your eyes outside the cockpit it stops you from getting fixated looking down at the normal displays i will say it is probably more useful in fighter jets and bush planes but i am not a pilot so i do not know it should cost not much more that a regular display and if you do not want to use it you probably do not have to  ohh i see thanks  in military aircraft your targeting reticle will show up in it and other info required to aim weapons  this is awesome  thank you how do you feel about the fpv i have used it on the 777 and i personally hate it  i love it it is a must have on the hud i hate the dual cue flight director and prefer a hud cue gulfstream or a single cue but hell i will fly a kite if you pay me enough  nice personally i love the dual cue fd is but i have never used a hud my company is 37 is have them so after this furlough i might get a shot at it edit 73 is to 37 is  sorry about the furlough hang in there brother  thanks man i will be back to complaining about contract rules before i know it  haha what do the decimals above and below the airspeed mean  the one above is the desired mach speed commanded by the flight management computer and the one below is the current mach speed  i figured thanks for confirming is not that a bit slow for such a high altitude no not at all it is right in the middle between low and high speed limits this airplane is going mach 85 right the actual ground speed is probably 5 hundred something we can figure it out 253kts at 41000 feet pressure altitude and 29 92 inhg standard temp approx 65c is 523 true airspeed and add the tailwind 49kts is 572kts ground speed is 659 mph  yep thanks for explaining  i honestly can not tell if this is a microsoft 2020 post that is a testament to the quality of the microsoft sim but this is very real  i can not tell a flight sim from the real thing anymore they really are that good  out of interest mach wise what is the slowest you can achieve mach wise within half an hour of decent in average terms  i am not sure what the question is can you clarify generally speaking we transition back to indicated airspeed out of 30k feet so i am not sure  i sequence a bunch of 787s into doha between cruise and fl220 we have mode s and can see you doing 85 or so up at 410 430 if i really need to slow you down up there before you descend how slow can you go i generally pull 81 out of my ass but if you can come back to 79 that would be great to know  let me look it up standby  so we do not have a chart for that but look at the airspeed tape the bottom block is at 217 and that is the min speed that keeps us out of the caution range where we are too slow and that equates to mach 74 which is slow it would be perfectly safe to request 77 or faster at fl410 and this safe window gets much slower as we descend in terms of mach at fl300 i show a min mach of 60 or 220 indicated in a clean config so to answer your question 77 or faster up to 85 is totally reasonable  legend thanks for the effort appreciate the professional input  what does the circle do at the bottom that is the heading compass  during landing it bounces up and down does it follow captured glideslope  do you mean the tiny circle in the middle    what is that cool art  yeah the album cover is very similar to the horizon of your post  r hudporn   holy crap that sounds terrifying  sounds like not turbulence and a plane issue where controls were well gone for a few seconds jesus if that is the case they are lucky it was only brief and not permeant clear air turbulance is a thing we do not know what it was at all yet but had it been a flight control issue you bet your ass they would have declared an emergency  the reddit link at the top of this post has an article in that post where crew is saying the screens and controls went black and they had no control over the aircraft it is not been independently confirm yet though   gt the screens and controls went black  please wait while windows finishes updating your computer  would you like to upgrade to windows 11 for free are you sure are you really sure fine but you have not seen the last of me  if it is flight control related then a pitch trim issue is likely trim settings can suddenly disengage in certain circumstances or unexpectedly stay on this lead to a it was initially reported as turbulence but the preliminary report ruled out that possibility  well that is terrifying right i am glad i keep my seatbelt on all the time  could not that also be a result of turbulence either from the sudden g forces loosening some battery connector or autopilot is reaction causing a system glitch shutdown  that is two random and very ver uncommon events happening for that to take place is it possible technically is it plausible no not really  how the hell does something like that happen has that ever happened before  it is complete speculation but i have flown planes where a similar malfunction can occur the autopilot is on then the servos manipulating the flight controls and or trim detects a binding in the controls and the aircraft trim system is not properly set anymore and you get a caution message the checklist then says disconnect the autopilot and be ready for strong control forces and sure enough when the autopilot comes off you can get a sharp climb or descent because the plane is not trimmed for level flight in this case it might have excessive nose down trim or not enough nose up trim and then you are bouncing passengers off the ceiling iirc this is what killed a private jet passenger on the east coast about a year ago it is another great reason to keep your seatbelt on at all times in this case they have been saying the controls went completely black fat captain bumps yoke trying to get to lav before brown light turns into fire bottle release  cosmic ray it supposedly happened to qantas flight 72  flight attendants have a far riskier job than people realize unless i have to use the restroom which intentional around on any flight less than 4 5 hours i always wear that seatbelt  funny story many years ago when i was in the military i was on a commercial flight to dallas with a lt col to get some simulator training the flight attendants were going around serving drinks when we hit a little turbulence he told the flight attendant that he was used to that stuff since he was a military pilot the flight attendant quickly responded so you are strapped in we have to do this standing up   which intentional around means what  ugh i meant which i intentionally plan around fancy way of saying i go before the flight so i do not have to get up typing on a phone sorry so many times the seatbelt sign goes off 10 minutes into the flight and the restroom line starts some of em with just socks on their feet smdh  those lounge beers do not have a long shelf life in my bladder i flew ber edi on saturday and within about two minutes of the seatbelt sign going off there was a queue of 4 people for the rear toilet also someone who tried using the front one when the captain announced 10 minutes to landing with the signs on on a 2 hour flight ffs  i had a flight delayed by 2 amp a half hours and stupidly did not go for a piss before takeoff soon as the seatbelt light clicked off i was down the aisle and at the rear lav so quickly the attendant had not even unlocked it yet we both had a chuckle before i hightailed it inside and drained the tank  i mean this never happens yeah super risky in 0 0001percent of cases so like a lot safer than any construction or manual labour activity the biggest danger in their line of work is disgruntled passengers transport to and from the airport and elevated risk of cancer due to higher radiation exposure  and the worst thing is that they have to risk their lives for 90percent of the time being forced trying to sell you every kind of shit you could buy literally 30 minutes before boarding or 15 minutes after landing idk who the hell can knowingly hold it 4 5 hours anything over 90 minutes i will happily pop back so i do not have to make a stop on the way to baggage claim this reminds me of the book airframe by michael chrichton  good book ultimately we did give china the wing  i loved it though i am sure there were some technical issues with the details accidental slats deployment sounds like a violent experience edit i am an idiot slats deployment did nothing thanks u purgance for the correction   no that was the whole point of the book slat deployment at cruising speed altitude is at worst a mild change in attitude the pilot literally flew the plane out of a safe operating envelope because he did not understand how the plane was designed to operate it is the opposite of boeing instead of relying on pilots to perform herculean feats of insight and strength to save the plane from crashing itself the plane in the book was designed to keep the pilots alive in almost any circumstance  which is why the pilot had to disable the autopilot first in order to manually cause the accident the plane was even designed to automatically save the pilot when he stopped giving faulty control inputs  you are absolutely right it is been awhile since i read it apologies and thanks for the correction  it is pretty obvious that norton is meant to be mcdonell douglas which of course bought boeing with boeing is own money  yes and the book does a very good job of dissecting the mcdonnell douglas is inept meme as compared with boeing that john oliver piece was ridiculous boeing has always been a profit first company the boeing that designed the max is the boeing that bought md boeing did not have any problems after the md acquisition that it did not have before their current troubles are caused by the anti union anti worker wall street pandering not because they got md food poisoning md built great airplanes for their era and boeing has too but the problem boeing has now is that its profit emphasis is making its aircraft demonstrably less safe than the competition which they can not hide from because the european regulators will not cover for boeing like the faa will  look up fray bentos accident a slat deployment at cruising altitude can be catastrophic  well two things  1 my comment is about the aircraft in the book which relates the tale of an airbus like airplane with modern safety systems in that plane slat extension is not a hazard and that is the thesis of the book 2 the accident you reference is not caused by slat extension it was caused by sensor malfunction bad speed readings and the fo is failure to follow instructions from the pilot crm the slat deployment was a part of the chain that led to the crash but without the preceding events slat deployment would not have led to the crash ie the pilots would not have extended the slats without the erroneous airspeed indication  1 fair i was just pointing out that slat deployment at cruise altitude is no joke 2 that makes no sense that is like saying both max accidents were cause by a aoa vane problem and not a poorly designed system in the au2553 what started the chain was a airspeed error but what sealed their fate was slat extention  in my opinion the issue with this analysis is that any part of the airframe could have failed in an overspeed condition not just the slats if the pilot deployed the thrust reversers or landing gear at cruising speed and they failed catastrophically would we say that the thrust reversers caused the accident the investigation report is in spanish but asn has a  that does not appear to say the slats caused the accident but rather that flight envelope the pilots put the plane into in response to the bad airspeed sensor was the cause of the accident  the distinction between this incident and the max is that the max did not experience any airframe failures of any kind the plane was intact and airworthy the avionics system just commanded it to fly into the ground  twa841 was brought up in this sub recently and had some pretty decent similarities somehow slats deployed one got stuck put the plane into a spiral dive pilots say they did not do anything wrong simulations after all seemed to be decently controllable according to the final report iirc  great book peak crichton  what kind of technical issue would cause this is not this kind of thing usually caused by clear air turbulence  a qantas airbus a330 had this happen a while back qf 72 if you want to read up on it there they had corrupted software and the plane commanded pitch down suddenly while in cruise from the wiki on qf 72 gt after detailed forensic analysis of the fdr the fcpc software and the adiru the cpu of the adiru was found to have corrupted the aoa data the exact nature of the corruption was that the adiru cpu erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the binary data that represented 37 012 the altitude at the time of the incident would represent an angle of attack of 50 625 the fcpc then processed the erroneously high aoa data triggering the high aoa protection mode which sent a command to the electrical flight control system to pitch the nose down 787 has been in service long enough now that maybe a software issue pops up once would sort of track with the other comments rumors that the flight deck went dark for a bit another possibility is the 787 has to be fully turned off and rebooted after 51 days to prevent misleading data from being shown to pilots one of the potential complications form that is the network switches inside the plane can crash  wild speculation alert maybe that was not done and bad data was fed into the computer or the internal network was reset mid flight  not really corrupted software they had buggy software qf 72 encountered a very rare corner case that was not handled by the software and as a result nosedived the airplane  or the pilot knocked the yoke forward and tried covering it up not saying 787 is perfect but it performs enough tests on itself during startup that something like this would have notified either maintenance or the flight crew will be very interested to read the report once it is released i love that i keep seeing articles about the company startup that is trying to be the first that has ai flying a plane let is get rid of the pilots and trust everything to code  seems like cat can not find any source that says anything else than technical problem but what kind of technical problem causes a sudden short drop in altitude the airplane was going at cruise speed when this happened the only thing that may cause this that is not weather climate related is vertical stabilizer failure right which seems pretty scary so hopefully it was just cat and media is overreacting one article said this gt it is not yet known what caused the technical problem on the flight to auckland gt in the united states the federal aviation administration last week reported an issue with boeing dreamliners de icing systems according to cnn gt the administration said a damaged seal could impact an engine inlet risking serious damage to the plane  there is an  with a quote from a passenger who said he asked the pilot what happened and the pilot responded saying my gauges just blanked out i lost all of my ability to fly the plane  at first i thought it must have just been cat but if there is any truth to that quote it sounds like it could be something much more serious an interesting observation from a passenger is that it seemed more people were injured towards the back of the plane double compared to those in the middle could that indicate an uncommanded pitch manoeuvre  really interested to see what comes of this i fly on dreamliners between australia and nz somewhat regularly so this could be concerning if it is a genuine fault in the aircraft  highly unusual for flight crew to reveal that to a passenger i can confirm that the pilot was conversing with passengers and not in a ladies and gentlemen please stay calm way unfortunately the conversation i witnessed was in spanish which i do not speak  also unusual for an aircraft to get rocked so hard 50 people sustain injuries with a dozen hospitalized someone who says they were on it said the captain did a walkthrough of the cabin which is already highly unusual  well dives and 50 injuries on a flight are also highly unusual it might be a rarely used protocol or maybe the pilot was just being empathetic to the situation when they were landed and medical staff was helping the injured not unlikely by any means after all his in charged this passenger was just on cnn live 45 minutes ago and repeated this statement he said the pilot had come back to see how people were doing that he the pilot looked like he was in shock and when the passenger asked what happened he said the pilot stated his gauges went blank and during that time he was unable to control the plane  yeah i am also concerned by this reported statement the airline itself has also said it was a technical issue it does not sound like turbulence i am really surprised that there is not more discussion about this aspect of the incident because if it is correct it is going to be a serious issue for 787 operators i am flying on an air nz 787 on sunday i am going to be honest here despite my involvement in aviation for much of my life i have never really felt comfortable on a 787 whenever i fly between nz and the us 4 to 5 times per annum i book to fly on the 777 everytime i know that the 787 is efficient and comfortable but given the choice i avoid it sadly air nz do not operate the 777 to honolulu  yeah and the flight tracking data went blank after the event happened and then came back around descent and landing so something technical definitely happened it seems  could be a quantas flight 72 kinda issue caused by a software fly by wire glitch that incident was probably caused by a subatomic particle flipping a bit in a memory word which happened to store air speed quite crazy edit or the memory word was storing angle of attack can not remeber for sure  which is why aviation critical computers are dual channel and error checked you can not get them to do anything with a single bit flip  ecc memory can correct a single bit automatically or detect double bit errors  unless it is a boeing in which case a  wow one bit that is quite a redundancy there  hate to ask could someone please define cat edit clear air turbulence it is like a dog just smaller and meows  unless you are kevin of reddit lore clear air turbulence clear air turbulence it is clear air turbulence basically just turbulence when there is no storm other indication  i had to  also cat is clear air turbulence  gt cat is defined as sudden severe turbulence occurring in cloudless regions that causes violent buffeting of aircraft this term is commonly applied to higher altitude turbulence associated with wind shear the most comprehensive definition is high altitude turbulence encountered outside of convective clouds this includes turbulence in cirrus clouds within and in the vicinity of standing lenticular clouds and in some cases in clear air in the vicinity of thunderstorms generally though cat definitions exclude turbulence caused by thunderstorms low altitude temperature inversions thermals strong surface winds or local terrain features  clean air turbulence a sudden and usually severe turbulence without any clouds causing it   clear air turbulence  i contributed  it is a creature that broadcasts its vocalizations on 121 5 mhz in the united states   gt seems like cat i can confirm cat walked across the plane is control panel causing the incident hmmmmmm i would doubt this has anything to do with engines even a total power failure would not cause the plane to simply fall for several seconds  reports of the instrument panel going dark more injuries at the rear of the plane and possibly the loss of altitude caused by the elevators pitching it down it makes no sense to me that power going out would cause a dive it should keep flying fairly level right  a software error could do all sorts of strange things and it sounds like in this case it caused the computer to send commands to pitch up or down now i am not saying this is usual at all redundancies are supposed to be in place to prevent this from happening if computer a sends gibberish the fact that computer b is not saying pitch should result in the aircraft staying level and sending warnings to the cockpit this is why it would be very concerning if a software issue put the aircraft in an unsafe condition  a boeing software error crashed two planes killing over 300 people there is precedent  was not it not so much a software issue as a systems engineering issue iirc the software did what it was supposed to it is just that that thing was not well thought through  exactly it was a feature not a bug just the wrong kind of feature for those on board  i know you are being sarcastic it was not a feature it was bad systems engineering the software did what it was supposed to do the systems integration failed  someone wrote the requirements that when plane does xxx do xnxx there is much more to it of course but that is the jist of it  right i thought the real issue was that the do xnxx part was not adequately conveyed to all customers and their pilots  and lack of training they wanted to tell their customers they could save training dollars  can someone with direct knowledge experience comment on whether something like has been reported can be accomplished with just control surfaces or would it require at least partially an atmospheric phenomenon  if you ignore disable flight envelope protections you could easily do this kind of thing with the controls accesible to the pilots  it can happen when there are issues between pitch trim settings and elevator position inputs modern aircraft stabilizers have two ways to control pitch pitch trim is for more long term adjustment if the plane is flying too nose high or low you can adjust pitch trim with usually a trim wheel control that will maintain that setting long term the other pitch control is short term flight control inputs from a pilot or autopilot pitch trim setting and elevator position can either counteract the inputs of the other or compound the inputs of the other pilot error computer error or mechanical failure can cause a pitch trim and elevator position combination that suddenly deviates from level flight  just wear the damn seat belt people this i do not give a shit if you get injured flying about the cabin but you are going to injure people who are doing the right thing and wearing their seatbelt and that makes you an arsehole obvious exceptions if you were on your way to or from the toilet or one of the cabin crew oh man i did not consider someone might be in the lav when this happened now is it still considered a poseidon is kiss at fl300  considering how violent it sounds it would definitely would not be a kiss more like poseidon eats ass  the poseidon special a poseidon tossed salad with chocolate mousse i want a poseidon ate my whole ass on a 787 dreamliner bumper sticker i was on a flight from luxor to cairo once that went through some pretty bad and totally unexpected turbulence my friend had just gone to the bathroom and he came back with a small cut on his head having been flung into the wall mid stream so to speak  and wet stains on his trousers  while i do agree with you that if you are sitting down you should be wearing your seatbelt as a general rule it should be noted that the seatbelt sign was turned off at the time of the incident and there was no turbulence prior to the event that would indicate something was about to occur you can not blame the people for moving around the cabin at that time  i have learned as an adult that many people do not understand basic physics yes the seatbelt sign is off but you should still wear it people are just stupid i was on a flight last week and while we were on our final landing approach a lady hopped out of her seat and tried to run back and use the bathroom at like 400ft when i could see the airfield out my window  when ya gotta go ya gotta go  maybe she was about to shit her pants and could not hold it any longer i am not gonna judge someone desperately running to a bathroom  having her get to the toilet would be a lot better than that lady who shat all down the aisle that caused the flight to divert  people are bad at reasoning about dangerous but low probability scenarios on 999 out of 1000 flights there is not extreme turbulence but on that 1000th flight there is and you might die without your seatbelt our primate brains have a tendency to look at patterns and conclude on 999 flights things are fine so i do not need my seatbelt and we do not consider how bad things can get in low probabilities events  this applies to flying in general flying is statistically safe but inevitably fringe scenarios occur and some cannot be salvaged when my wife was pregnant the obgyn was trying to explain the risks of a natural birth small but statistically worth considering like 1 in 500 she was 38 possible placenta previa my arrogant brain thought well that is a tiny risk doc says ozlander you travel a lot for your job right yeah about 100k miles pa  so here is the question heathrow handles a minimum 500 flights a day on one specific day you know a plane will definitely crash do you fly that day or choose another i know this is a reverse analogy to aviation statistics but it really helped me grasp probability plus reminded me how safe aviation is and my son was was born safely too  i work in security and spend a huge chunk of my day doing risk analysis it is one of those things that human brains are simply are not good at which is why distilling things down to numbers works so much better than our intuition otherwise it is easy to spend a lot of time and money trying to solve the wrong problems glad to hear your son was born safely   this a little choppy on the takeoff climb and captain does not turn off the light wear your seatbelt beautiful clear day smooth as glass flight light is off does not matter wear your seatbelt when not going to the bathroom i have been in clear air turbulence thankfully it was mild but shocking to the people who were not wearing their seatbelt can not tell you how annoyed i was at seeing parents letting their young kid take off the seatbelt right after takeoff and when we were still in the initial climb out no less the last time i flew if your ass in in the seat the belt goes around your waist  man as a parent with young kids who flys regularly wish it was that easy sometimes you have to pick and choose your battles i keep them mostly buckled in but sometimes you have to let them loose and yes i am a professional pilot i know the risks  sounds like qantas 72 except with a 787 instead of an a330 people are going to start refusing to fly on boeing airplanes  you are getting down voted but you are right a number of issues with boeing aircraft some unrelated and the faa investigation into boeing determining their safety is basically non existent is not good press it took about as much bad press to effectively ruin md which then turned into the boeing shit show we know today  i mean i always had positive feelings about boeing up until very recently i do not know how you could not question them after all the recent press  much of that recent press is clickbait though selected and published specifically so that news outlets can put a boeing hashtag in the post and drive engagement pilot error and maintenance are the lead suspects for the recent united airlines issues for example if you look at a full incident report you will see several airbus aircraft over the last few days weeks that have suffered engine failures hydraulic failures smoke in the cockpit severe turbulence a tail strike faulty door indicators an a330 had a very similar issue to this incident just a couple months ago that injured 70 passengers and everyone forgot about it after a few days if it were a boeing they would likely still be talking about it  i already agreed with you but agree even more now that a  after not showing up for his deposition their bad press just got a lot worse it will be interesting to see what happens when airbus has a monopoly on the airliner market and lockheed martin has a monopoly on the military aircraft market  people already are on kayak com you can specifically filter out boeing aircraft and it became so popular they changed the site to make the option easier to find  also known as no ryanair  i mean i think maybe people should try to choose airbus if possible regardless of how safe their planes still are the fact that they have done all this shady cover up corporate bullshit should make them lose business spend your money elsewhere until boeing remembers to prioritize quality over shareholders   if it is boeing i am not going   i thought i was dreaming i opened my eyes and he was on the roof of the plane on his back looking down on me it was like the exorcist  passenger quote from the flight  so the pilot has confirmed that they lost all instruments they all went blank  not good not fucking good at all one person said the pilot said that i would not put a ton of faith in that being the facts  yeah like why would a pilot tell a customer that it just makes absolutely no sense for them to say that it is a really bad look for the airline and easy for a customer to misconstrue  must have been one hell of a mechanical problem i would love to know why this happened and i imagine boeing are currently terrified it might partly be their fault  this is not what i need to see 30 minutes before getting on a plane  hope you have a safe and most boring flight ever  it was very jumpy on the way down just from turbulence i was expecting a rough landing but i honestly think it might have been the smoothest i have ever experienced somehow and i have been on a lot of planes  you will in all likelihood be just fine i hope you make it to your destination safe  i survived  complete speculation but there was a surprise solar flare coronal mass ejection that occurred seemingly around the time of this incident reported effects include radio issues for planes in the southern hemisphere  could a solar flare cause instruments to blank out for a few seconds  it would take some awful luck but theoretically yes  this is not a terrible theory if they caught the brunt of it and were very unlucky but it does not seem the most likely  that would be pretty interesting i would think it would be highly unlikely given the location on the map in the link you posted this flight was from australia to new zealand i am sure boeing is really hoping it is something like this though  thinking the same thing solar flare caused a single event upset  very possible earth is magnetic south pole is near southern australia and its a known environment for cosmic ray hits my phd project was a balloon borne telescope that flew from new zealand and we noticed several more hits while over that region i would not discount a bitflip or some magnetic activity it could have either caused the controls to blank out so autopilot disengaged and if the trim is set to nose down then cause an abrupt change or it could have caused uncontrolled maneuvres  boeing has fucked their reputation so hard that it does not matter whether or not this is their fault most people paying a little bit of attention will blame them and they deserve it  exactly i can not believe i am more anxious to fly than ever  that is pretty close to the intertropical convergence zones you can get some pretty wild weather and without warning there edit not it is not be interesting to hear what the technical problem is my money is on severe cat  syd is the same south latitude as lax is north both are quite a ways away from the ictz  la is 33 5 n sydney is 31s not exactly close together right they are pretty close to the same relative latitude i e distance from the equator i edited the op to be more clear    it is absolutely not near nz at any time of year the closest it gets in winter there is the solomon is convective weather of course forms on the tasman as do strong cold fronts but there is no ictz factor ever there  even in january at its lowest the ictz is at about 20 south syd is 33 south akl is 37 south close to the march solstice the ictz is starting its move north   i fly regularly between nz and the us based in nz the itcz begins a long way north of nz this was nowhere near that region i really hope it was cat but the rumours i am hearing are of something a lot more serious hope it is not true because i am flying again on a 787 on sunday from auckland to honolulu  sounds like a fcs malfunction thats scary as hell i am wondering if this technical problem would only happen at altitude or if it could also happen on landing or takeoff at those points seatbelts are the least of your worries  if the title is actually real that sounds like a huge problem a plane should not just drop out of nowhere without a weather phenomenon hopefully we will get public follow up on the issue  it almost had to be air turbulence planes do not just drop unless they lose vertical stabilizers or a wing falls off  could if the software suddenly says i need to pitch down now  software messing with the planes pitch that is unheard of s boeing going so hard in 2024  so much for my fear that planes do not just drop out of the sky  pitot tube frozen even the 787 only has 2  really unbelievable that so many people on this flight would not be wearing their seatbelts how is that even possible do they have different rules in that part of the world  well assuming they were an hour out from landing they probably had finished some sort of meal service and people were going to the bathroom stowing stuff in overhead bins etc 24 people out of their seats on a 787 all at once does not seem out of the ordinary in that scenario also counting flight attendants  light was off people often have belts off in such a scenario  i am sure some people do but why seems dumb to not just click it on while you are sitting there going absolutely nowhere  people value their comfort over safety all the time especially when they overestimate safety because nothing ever happened to them the previous 100 is of times they had their belt off on an airplane  it is scenarios like this that caused me to always purchase a ticket for my young children and bring a car seat rather than holding an infant in my lap can you imagine what would have happened to an infant in someones lap on this flight straight into the overhead bins  keeping the belt on is such a simple thing to keep you safe in crazy situations and people will not even do that  it does not even cost any comfort or effort though it is on a similar level though not as dangerous to not turning on headlights in the rain people who just will not do anything for safety unless somebody makes them  the seat belts on an aircraft are not uncomfortable though you are already stuck there in a tiny seat it is not like the belt can really make that any worse  people are just dumb apes all it really comes down to you literally cannot even feel the seatbelt if it is not cranked down moronically even a loose configuration will keep them from flying out of their seats  you do not have to wear your seatbelt if the seatbelt sign is off it is just recommended that you do so  in the us it is strongly recommended that you wear your seatbelt at all times unless you are up and out of your seat to go to the restroom stretch or get something out of the overhead bin whenever i fly my personal observance is that most everybody keeps their seatbelt on because most everybody has read seen stories of people flying about the plane because of unexpected turbulence and or sudden plane maneuvers just seems dumb to not wear it  agreed and once you have felt the effects of anything beyond mild turbulence which anyone who flies a lot probably has you respect it i have been thrown while in line for the lav and having the surface you are standing on vanish from beneath your feet in a second will rattle you with a quickness  recently had a pretty wild flight slc abq buckled in tight but also holding on to the arm rests but they no longer stay locked down so that is pretty useless these days  the point of the seatbelt off sign is to allow you to use the restroom or quicky get something out of a bin you really should have your seatbelt on at all times unless you are getting out of the seat temporarily it is not meant for you to slop it off and sit there the whole flight like a moron  and it is not mandatory because accidents like these are freakish which a lot of these commenters are forgetting imagine someone slipped on a banana peel one day and cracked their skull on the sidewalk should we all then be required to wear a helmet when we walk down the street  here is the link to the previous thread  and  from u kjack9 who was on board the flight according to  article latam has confirmed it was due to a technical fault and not turbulence   technical fault is still a rather broad category  it looks like op posted an amp link these should load faster but amp is controversial because of maybe check out the canonical page instead    i am a bot    good bot this has happened at least twice before in the general area quantas fl72 and fl71 actually the flight attendant caused it when she hit a switch on the pilots seat while serving a meal to him or she was giving him head either way all good  holy shit uncommanded sudden drop in altitude waiting for more information  i will try to avoid boeing line the plague in the future not a lot of details concerning what happened yet but it sounds and i am absolutely no expert like it was less a technical issue and more like a freak pocket of extreme air pressure change planes do not just fall out of the sky unless they lose their wings the way passengers are describing it it is like they were suddenly just free falling or maybe the plane suddenly pitched down dramatically is this another mcas issue which i thought was just on the 737 max you do not necessarily have to be falling in order to experience zero reverse g is in the cabin any big downward change in pitch in an airplane can cause that sensation even if you are still in a climb  go resd the report from other posts seems like the plane had a technical malfunction and the pilots corrected it that is why they were so visibly shaken  i have been on the same flight last year but the other way round from auckland to sydney it was quite comfortable crazy to see that this happened on the same plane can you imagine that those passengers have to take another flight from nz to scl a flight of 10hrs 10hr flying alone over the ocean with nothing nearby only antarctica on one side  looks like they had zero turbulence other than the sudden movement  puts on boeing again turbulence is not a technical problem which one is it  what i am getting from all of these reports is do not fly boeing    did the flight get into the coffin corner  people keep telling me that the recent string of commercial well and private snafus are all par the course and simply an example of reporting bias etc is that still the case i do not remember seeing this frequency of such news say ten years ago is this truly just false perception p s save the righteous rhetoric i am not publishing a paper asserting anything but asking a perhaps rare honest question and hoping for an honest response from more informed people than myself  rough start for boeing this year  i am interested in this i was on a 787 flight from chicago to paris where a similar sounding thing albeit much less severe occurred flight attendant got injured and the pilot went back to chicago heard nothing about the cause or any other injuries came out of nowhere pilot quickly yelped through the loudspeaker flight attendants take your seats then two consecutive dips that lasted a few seconds each then not a bump the whole way back to chicago im almost certain it was just random turbulence but what if    just a plane lets leave political stuff out i quite like their livery takes 2nd behind etihad for favorite middle eastern liveries  i have not seen that before i only really get a chance to see them when i fly into yyz    it goes both ways man why can not we just have a form where we can be civil  better yet do not comment if you do not like it this sub is about aviation and the discussion of aviation not politics and religion    this sub is about aviation and the discussion of aviation not politics and religion

flex boeing great job 28 20 bruh even engineers give f ck hired job boeing 787 battery insane engineering funny watched 9 years old documentary exposing litany errors aircraft makes wonder boeing paid glad see cameo 94th fts usafa gliders think flown saber 2 2at former air force aircraft mechanic would fly 787 money world unless death wish would definitely fly aircraft manufactured assembled non union workers company self regulates believe little research takes minutes would flying fire hazard along 737 max junk 737 advanced longer requires door plug screws flew 787 higher air pressure notice difference compared aluminum plane terms feeding tired even noise levels plane imagine sick would boeing engineered 737 successor ground like plane illusion burst everybody saw boeing without cloth profit profit 787 bleedless engine intake anti ice use bleed air compressor needs remake yet 15 58 ahhh laminar flow like shit many ads one particular minor issue 787 passenger overhead cabin bins

couple years never get plane know mad glad research found aluminum 7085 used even confused welding 7xxx aluminum invites stress corrosion microcracks nvm worked 7085 aluminium alloy used inclusion 8percent zinc paired magnesium copper allows alloy precipitation hardened assisting retard dislocations within metal furthermore inclusions chromium improve corrosion resistance help limit stress corrosion often associated welding zinc alloys zirconium also added order inhibit recrystallisation prevents growth new defect free grains allowing alloy maintain desirable hardness strength characteristics finally titanium inclusions used refine primary aluminium grains increases number grain boundaries resulting ductile material controlling grain size way also assists corrosion resistance many grain boundaries promotes galvanic corrosion coarse grains provide enough space pathways ions travel making difficult develop uniform passive film thus reducing corrosion resistance might good aircraft disregard tools ladder rags left assembly well lousy build quality finally boeing putting disregard passenger safety profit fucking patented fully metal fff 3d printing 787 crap sorts quality control issues never fly recent boeing thanks fart joke simply enough watching stoned people amazing created booked flight paris chicago quite assure prices trip gotten cheaper quite bit expensive potential risk boeing aircraft properly enjoyed wish tv companies brave enough make succinct informative documentaries people interested facts details think boeing really take bet though received billions gov funding specifically 787 would surely bailed fail doubly since gov contractor hats incredible engineers let keep context boeing historical lackluster leadership yes receive huge

parachutes self landing devices case engine failure would rather need safety saving money fuels making planes lighter cheaper besides super interesting video great job explaining principles aerodynamics pilot training found unexpectedly helpful thanks change appreciate drop airfares irritating voice former manufacturing engineer 787 impressed video amazing something heavy get ground serious power used afraid fly knowing fly one engine seeing fire still land safely yer paid lets say lives took persuit profit flying aruba 787 soon great video mister real engineering stop dammm

mustang civil airliners regular wings bash thru turbulence dreamliner surfs one small issue video fact 350 also composed primarily carbon fiber reinforced plastics rather aluminum video despite innacuracy fantastic far best video detailing construction techniques 787 talked someone worked eurofighter 2015 warned hard work make eurofighter carbon fibre safe lightning strikes said would worry 787 787 predecessor 777 never fly 787 period despite boeing sponsored youtube pr gimmicks revolutionary exploding battery triumph round headed rivets used long time airplane skins think ww2 started using flush mounted flat headed rivets texans endure british accent announcers annoying another doccie badly built aircraft never fly one massive paert carban fibers remember caerben faerting enjoying mentioned thug mcgregor like videos irish accent stayed aluminum fuselage would saved two years development issues cheaper tickets sure airbus a350 direct competitor 787 a350 much bigger thing common lot composite materials dislike using anglo measurements unable watch 2nd worst aircraft worst brand amazes aircraft like a321 boeing 737 trains atlantic routes lol appreciate mma analogy airbus a350 gt boeing 787 watching long haul flight 787 learning painful details 737 max fiasco never board boeing aircraft mcgregor haha awesome vid watching serious video aviation advancements also 3 55 impregnated heh videos available back graduating insane quality well explained without using math keep thing going pal fellow aeronautical engineer greetings italy pleasure flying two passenger amazing plane takeoff smooth fast cruising altitude fl400 surprised a10 refueling appreciate conor mcgregor joke know congrats love 737 max kills people a350 still better though engineers outranked economists biggest thing hate plane companies employing 333 seat layout insane engineering totally put watching title please try explaining plastic impregnated carbon stronger aluminium airplanes layman well cyclists come agreement recently traveled 787 dreamliner without engineering knowledge aircraft apart size windows dimming lighting features thing struck landed way aircraft cockpit entire internal central ceiling spine aircraft wobbled violently tyres touched runway brakes applied never seen watching guess flexibility materials used voice soothes try sleep cause sleep problems make sure forget add phelange random shade throw mcgregor thank work put making channel great one top channels seen produced youtube many inaccuracies far superior a350 egg shaped windows one also mention infamous 787 issues er like gaps fuselage etc halted production new deliveries 787 taken place since may 2021 insane engineering yes insane relying much plastic airbus using carbon fibers 40 years scandal boeing 737 max stay airbus please make one episodes a350 wrote video script first grade children a350 better 787 really studyed seen a350 haves better cabin comfortable fuel efficency bigger cockpit idk say 6 21 shot pattaya thailand anyone know name piano song played background intro first 1 min b777x king shit build hemp fail actually insane would work way flying boeing let loved one

ability self certify plane 737 max check nebula version perfect video 3am first plane experience turkish airlines boeing 787 great plane went details even cover engineering apprentice ge aviation relatively recently damn composite except wing introduced 777x save gas buy boeing travel safety style comfort fly boeing bold love boeing dazzling approach landing yippeee get around thermal expansion paint problems airbus lmao connor mcgregor dig much like planes advancing miss bigger jets alot comfortable space wise thanks lol f boeing ok planes kills people yes paper perfect amazing plane quality supply chain failures showed boeing made many shortcuts cascade suppliers sub contractors quite poor quality level even design flaws appeared faa decided make real rigorous checks boeing never cared aspect could sell plane like hot potatoes b737 max fiasco made clear boeing corrupted faa certification planes today b787 program costing fortune boeing despite high sales dramaliner problem b777x seems designed way bad bad bad management boeing even somehow criminal well beautiful airplane indeed hopefully well nice beginning 60 minutes story plane 787 ridiculous initial construction introduction interim plane empty shell demonstrate reporters businesses people behind schedule found gonna demonstration flight bad press boeing cutting corners everywhere save money using pair parts parts would pass initial inspection would last needed used anyways etc whistleblowers threatened fired boeing absolutely shameful example creating something efficient possible matter cost manufacturing difficulty would like see background sound irritating annoying stopped viewing video a350 comparable ever much less fuel efficient expensive use carbon fiber aircrafts make cheaper fact even expensive boeing selling airbus 30 1 beginning part video drives much fact wings highly flexible never talked performance advantage flexible wing high amount flex actually byproduct property cfrp material better specific strength significan advantage using flexible wing rigid wing aerodynamically speaking fact might even minimal negative impact love channel really respect knowledge thing negative balance sheet think meant negative income statement quite right negative net income bro excellent video truly tell name composer song playing background 25 00 please man need bro going boeing 787 summer buts dreamliner less farting scientifically guaranteed basic concept fluid mechanic bernoulli equation also know galvanic effect happens stainless steel amp carbon steel surface learn stuff university back 1990s thank updating knowledge recent airofoil design amp development although practice field engineering also thank updating even carbon fibre non metal contacts aluminum metal would also trigger galvanic effect think happened different metal surface also 3d metal printing born era astronauts able print glock handgun international space station even taken one launching material science method making product already traditional understanding concept thank new information enginner needs constant updating technical knowledge gt many change 30 years care never see hear anything boeing go praising boeing engineering expertise obviously avoiding fact boeing deserves barred business negligently actively caused deaths 300 people two 737 max airplanes makes boeing anathema amongst american corporations loving ufc references ahahaha fantastic video unfortunately 787 program experiencing production moratorium primarily result disgusting trendss unearthed 737 max causing faa take deeper look boeings production processes ever example company placing higher value profit people look boeing massive means heavy extensive might word use tell wanna sex 787 without telling wanna sex 787 isnt plane little quality control staff doesnt want fly small correction 1 53 a350 big compete 787 competes 777 competitor 787 a330neo mostly composite except wings excellent production could refrain using rather silly description insane title boeing pinnacle aviation like toyota pinnacle automotive fuck shit 21 44 results tonne waste metal metal gradually shaved away result wasted metal shavings simply smelted reused cheaper ever doubt 24 42 sleep deprived heard lightning strikes kurd every 3 000 hours thought looks like someone back anymore know idiot defense 58 hours electrolytes plants crave amazing video ufcs reference tho inspires confidence except focus cost cutting safety particularly lightning protections removed little explanation plane shot holes lightning strike problem pronounced ah lume inum 4 35 think cook pizza oven written transcript video refer flying first one friday let go brandon 0 00 yes many advanced solutions aircraft grounded several times great n shame engineered stay sky u said a350 aluminium plane actually made carbon fiber 787 stuff really cool know dreamliner much better still makes really sad probably ever fly 747 flown dreamliner tbh kinda lame maybe terrible airline gave barely leg room food terrible still rip 747 like says kherben fibre insane engineering boeing 737 wonder saying sackler settlement incredibly generous new sackler settlement v2 0 changed provide dollar750 million victims 149 000 made claims 500 000 deaths caused opioid deaths occurred us albeit others also involved see cnbc means divided equally victim surviving family members would receive dollar5000 per death injury dad mom child relative court cases allowed filed sacklers juries would awarded judgments sacklers opine would ranged dollar250 000 per victim dollar100 000 000 per victim including punitive damages sacklers lost one lawsuit found negligent acted wrongfully victims one lawsuit brought judgment would become res judicata negligence etc knowledge etc later victims could easily get settlements merely citing final judgment doctrine collateral estoppel sacklers would established sackler misconduct via settlement therefore likely sacklers saved rest reported dollar11 billion dollar fortune paying dollar6 billion thus corrupt settlement arguably violates constitution takings clause misusing government power bankruptcy court power agent government rob victims survivors persons opioid caused deaths causes action sacklers worth many many billions expected value jury awards victims could even borrow right settlement paltry sum may divided among nearly 500 000 claimants however due whatever ags politicians received none states apparently appeal set aside settlement grossly unfair victims rescued defeat jaws victory share beers laugh yell hell victims families must include members every ethnic racial religious group usa opioid addiction become common among groups bet ags politicians gave sacklers generous deal receive contributions sacklers allies rest lives may become senators even presidents insider trading tiny taking money giving favors ultrarich real money made like 787 maybe profitable efficient airlines passengers ideal made purely keeping airlines mind passengers smaller plane less leg room 26 42 ah yes boeing infamous cost saving measures reason given make training mandatory 737 max pilots hundreds died pilots aware system failed consequently disable love flying modern marvel sit looking wing takeoff flight wings flex look like birds wings girl wants fly aluminium background tune drives crazy sounds like boeing broadcast video coz airbus a350 made 53percent carbon fibre boeing 787 50percent absolutely comparable big difference engines capacity range nice video onre remark plastic resin resin plastic keep talking carbin fiber plastic resin thing exist great know boeing cuts hella corners manufacturing know good builds actually absoloutely love channel also pleasure seeing c17 taxi takeoff action make video c17 please marvel structural engineer engineering 787 makes head hurt amazing video informative entertaining best nothing like concorde 1969 airbus dream hope expansion contraction issues resolved composite high altitude still iffy best peace brother feel like university thanks flights gone astronomically sooo connor mcgregor career cut short structural stress bone got unbreakable titanium shin bone nowadays career long prosper 737 max one insane engineering love documentary would never fly 787 al jazzerer respect boeing company excepting engineers plunged rot

capability birds planes ability dramatically morph flight greatest hindering factor amount energy required obtain desired shape transformation maximize efficiency probably viable larger commercial aircraft smaller military craft might able take advantage capability boeing going lie computer systems plane let hundreds people die boeing built would insane fly oh boeing company killed 346 people making faulty plane 737 max thanks rather drive boeing cutting costs removing thin copper strips unbelievable absolutely awesome video guys brian software use animations video thanks watching videos 737 max 787 dream liner problems problems manufacturing plant st louis makes want get something definitely unknown hidden problems creep atleast decade sound track 28 40 please bad airplane good

aircraft fly good engineering ruined poor management shame rip lost scheduling prioritized safety boeing today good boeing people still think good video tho intro video saying flights different destinations without connections isnt really true tbh mean yeah sure live near major airline hub eg course otherwise connect big airport home big airline order get destinations super much insane engineering goes 787 would appreciate data info relative rolls royce engines specifically designed commercial airliner thank making another video specifically addresses details thank coloradan 787 feel difference pressure colorado around 6000 feet sea level feel bad people sea level riding 737 though super cool video pleasure crossing atlantic one beautiful birds two years ago crazy looking

repaired minor damage due unibody graphite construction design manufacturing engineer 787 program really appreciated video much content systems aware structures side thank creation upload amazing commercial boeing created love narrator specific accent could english scottish aussie nothing particular pleasing great job boeing good english speaking humans everywhere ummmm wth deal klm logo 12 16 amp 12 18 video compression artifact skin embedded display excellant video work 787 daily major airline things us amt know know aircraft totally amazing airplane thx video let hope boeing fixing quality control sc plant planes much love channel even educated love listening intelligent documentary fiber plane mute guatemalan methodologically grab record seemingly delay beneath nutty octagon private tangible voice window comparison slide compared 787 window size equivalent aluminium airlines a350 fuselage made composite materials though summarised studied materials engineering great research work kudous 13 56 amateur journalism kills cancel qantas cancel australia become absolute dictatorship due covid love rant video imperial system channel uses feet video yes standard aviation industry excuse use stupid imperial units vid knocks park fabulous explain strain stress ductility hardeness force get right maybe understood mosquito made plywood mass worked well wow thought video would cool exceeded expectations lot totally kick ass video american taste airbus trillion times better period interesting use word insane title engineers insane first time heard use carbon fiber super cool stuff airplanes seems hardware part airplanes getting better software part buggy complete ignorant subject could somebody knowledge enlighten u make really great videos would better u could release 30 min videos 2 parts nd release gap 1 2 days thing wrong plane crashges kills people lol well thanks putting idea human hair composites head hhrp yet another wrong explaination aircraft wing generates lift people get right see hope boeing take great team engineers look b737 max see save model lot lives process going third semester aerospace engineering noticing video creates great link final product kinds basics taught first two semesters recognizing tons aspects materials science construction elements applied mechanics etc awesome make planes longer like limousine make room could made long want fit say 2000 people also true boeing drastically reduced amount fasteners use still use lot fuselage example fuselage frames fastened titanium fasteners fuselage skins main competitor 787 a350 a330 a330neo a350 goes 777 777x main reason smaller planes twin engine airplanes took bigger 4 engine airplanes mainly development improvement engines engines 787 20percent efficient predecessor basically producing trust burning less fuel copper mesh mention wing fuselage reason described conducting electricity mainly lighting strikes aware removing safety issue remove copper mesh fuselage primary structure left without protection creating lot issues structurally repairs damages already huge issue mesh imagine would example given lighting strike damage aluminum airplane may take couple days fix bad similar damage un composite fuselage may take around month millions dollars limited people world tooling skill set may change future right big deal quote every plane manufacturer first car ever owned 1966 body made fibreglass reinforced plastic lighter stronger steel enabled car smaller economical engine mini cars dead end model discontinued cars made material good see similar material practical aircraft resin plastic become plastic becomes thermoset way different plastic rheologic chemical point view thing needed graphene coating incredible video even high standards great job seeing documentary talking 787 developement workers built said would ever board 787 due safety cutbacks bad engeneering hope never ever fly one planes yeah lol love working quite interesting aircrafts starting use carbon fiber layup construction bicycle industry past 15 years carbon fiber road bike carbon layered complex patterns optimize bike torsionally stiff increase power transfer bike also flexible increase comfort rider similar wings 787 use carbon layup increase strength specific areas allow flexibility others metric insane engineering worst experience passenger go way avoid flying first time excited travel waiting a350 yet much prefer 350 matter taste perhaps airlines packing much seats mean 3 4 3 forbidden 26 43 yeah good old boeing plays people life cost cutting see companies sharing tech like alu 3d printing method system small holes prevent drag would much advanced sadly capitalism stifling progress everyone wants keep another thoroughly interesting well researched well produced video thank really enjoy channel however weighing pros cons cfrp structures vs conventional metallic ones seemed bit incomplete bias towards cfrp technology think things considered big gap metallic cfrp conventional aircraft configurations wing tube blended blended wing size type configurations perhaps would good include bvid effect mechanical properties limitations causes design considerations requires overall manufacture operation aircraft highly orthotropic properties cfrp particularly thickness oop loading direction problems cause particular corner unfolding bonding co curing issues ensuring effective bond peeling stresses geometric discontinuities cte mis match cfrp al alloys actually one main drivers use ti hybrid cfrp metallic structures corrosion important protection schemes enable al gt cfrp assys relatively poor tolerances achieved producing cfrp parts assy aircraft issues brings list could go great see many students engineering engaged comments would encourage dig bit deeper practical realities concluding cfrp wonder material like materials applied designed properly fantastic unfortunately real world considerations come play needs climate change mitigation need zero lower emissions making flying cheaper convenient comfortable runs contrary needs need reduce flying much possible make efficient gh b7bh g btbg videos insane well done basically get lighter materials make wings associated high velocity birds a350 remarkable plane still see cost 6x much develop 777 reflection disaster boeing become since allowing mcdd execs company thanks sharing preliminary design team 787 video admirable job documenting technology design challenges items slightly incorrect composite wing nowhere close able make 19000 microstrain 1 9percent elastic deformation value appropriate called uni axial tensile coupon one made fibers 0 degree direction aligned load application actuality airplane designed fibers added plus minus 45 degree direction take load around holes cutouts one also requires fibers 90 degree direction wings also need designed holes fasteners manufacturing flaws accidental damage might occur service reduces design strain 50percent pristine material remember well wing lower surface tension upper surface compression exceptional tensile capability useful wing strength may actually designed compression capability material addition composite material strength reduction elevated temperature like middle east low temperatures like high altitude rich information free thank ad lords oh great freak look window see wings flex couple feet conventional aluminum body aircraft say 787 wings flex three meters way im flying boeing ever engineered superbly till crash countless times 787 a350 direct competitors 787

people carbon fiber jets never bring america skyscapers unless leased owned lucky larrry silverstein boeing paid promotional video nothing new compared composite aircrafts model flash graphene additive plastic resins reduce mass increase strength composites lol imo boeing unreliable sloppy writing aspect ratio cause wing flex aluminum airplanes flush rivets decades little homework needed informative video connor mcgregor dustin porier example pretty sure good friend mine appears video beautiful plane yet many airlines still want 737 boeing built decades boeing able kill hundreds passengers brand new poorly engineered aircraft used like a321xlr gonna toss several main engineers involved designing plane said would never fly boeing cut lot corners one great video love a350 would

words work quite well instead using word often still enjoy informational videos great job real engineering video 787 engines pretty underrated without 787 sitting duck wow amazing high quality video like seriously learned much impossible take attention away thank paid well boeing development novel supply chain became boondoggle going take many years production recover costs actually making net profit beyond doubt long time imagine advanced planes would companies compete like research public goal build best airplane yeah cool paper airplane also flies amazing bleed air exhaust simply air

pulling data together science production quality video simply insane thank til planes complicated 6 26 laughed way hard class saw awesome video say machining wastes lots titanium sort true think reason 3d printing use little complicated think cost comes time takes remove material lost material machining expensive slow compared processes stamping something metal takes seconds dozens parts machining minutes one part waste metal either way chips cookie cutter left metal recycled get money back 3d printing waste much metal likely even slower machining reason might net gain airline industry probably wants light parts need rectangle cut titanium mill easily beat 3d printer need rectangle honeycomb holes cut middle save weight gets interesting mill cut hexagons one time roughing finishing one start 3d printed material already mostly air rather metal need finishing critical areas mill also wear tooling slower way even complex parts get rid operations fixtures mill would even make internal features mill could make 3d printing becomes huge win sure possible money saved titanium think common people outside manufacturing estimate much cost comes materials underestimate much cost comes time wonder use carbon fiber titanium parts wonder trap doors tail waste gate turbines sucking air imagine pressure got high release air somewhere video perfect storm content narrative

repair impact lightning strike pretty rapidly case 787 likely improve future aircraft damaged service aircraft grounded months repair scheme available aircraft also seems prone lightning strikes whilst rare older aircraft 787 seems prone lightning strikes due difficult repair schemes major headache airlines engineering teams a350 took fair conservative approach 787 usually good idea aviation industry airbus stuck traditional construction methods added use carbon fibre also stuck tradition system layout due keeping bleed air systems surface a350 appears fewer headaches since implementation well scientists love using term supercritical informative thank usually take degas avoid bloating travelling long distances aeroplane good educational video question happens crashes know think negative case know plane aluminum bend deform shatter cases saves ppl inside crash like car crumple zones absorbing energy happens anything deform reducing impact much carbon fibre brittle shatters

thing works meanwhile boeing 100 planes completed undeliverable yet may made mistakes making one big part strip completely cost millions per plane check need fixing boeing want negotiating creation statistical analysis process predict areas planes need fixing actually quite interesting great advertisement composites put mildly fantastic engineering american technology world leader good reason

employee quitting especially 30 minute commute turns 3 4 hours way well vatican thing must okay works catholic church ignored ultimately transferred could mean anything raise issue official channels yes ignored likely consequence pointing management enough follow company mandated safety process transferred happens time necessarily causal link two people worked industry please keep open mind stuff

dangerous fatigue builds even design flaws sometimes take years cause incidents regulators assume old design automatically safe 7 years md 11s started flipping example 1 000 787s built compared 200 md 11s 5 times many planes flying almost twice long really sound like reasonable comparison airframes fail drilling issues become metal fatigue issue c checks exist 12 5 years oldest frames checks vast majority least 1 c check multiple dreamliner quite metal correct actually easier find bad composite ultrasound find aluminum cracks eddy current takes bit time checks thing still failure engineering process though aviation installation checks right rectify subsequent checks light deep maintenance case c make sure holding per design assumed degradation rate saying ok c checks pick poor practice relied upon isolation swiss cheese incident waiting happen kinda like whole fiasco allowing pilot get back cockpit locked inside right let tell first 100 shipsets warped composite floor beams lasers measuring one point confirm titanium seat tracks didnt fit part belonged alenia engineering procurement subbed another company iai make isreal straight 100 sets already made installed best could engineering said safety flight issue replace check tested actual airframe 165k simulated flight cycles determine actual structural issues airframe made prior manufacturing improvements 2021 seattle times article actually provides details problem think plan randomly fly planes see long last helped build fatigue airframe old unimproved 8 variant still b checks find issues sometimes result aircraft moving heavy check think currently 787s fine around quite guarantees airlines maintenance program better boeings assembly line think missing point relying various mid life maintenance inspections pick basic design construction failures indication 787 massive structural issues based age despite allegations also aircraft basic design construction failures issues exclusive boeing aircraft ad campaigns used address issues become known airbus thales avionics ddrmi need checked due problems result failure erjs aft cargo doors issues staying closed need checked ads released active airframes address issues happens personally corrected many varying issues found different aircraft manufactured boeing companies point long people design build aircraft design construction failures like regardless makes aircraft sometimes takes one instances failure discover problems ok missing point posts comments driven unfounded conspiracies surrounding whistleblower john barnett death wait investigation complete claiming ignorantly issue boeing quality especially unsupported based statistical data reliability safety every time tire goes flat boeing aircraft days 1 000 social media posts awful boeing aircraft dumb posts people comment presuming issues may even exist knew john loooong ago 787 days know well surprised life completely ruined long drawn stress court proceedings made take life nearly done going similar live real world wrong yes going break service unlikely safety flight issue ship put note maintenance book safety 1 remember lot logistics business making happening involved trick beat business daddy take lunch money right without going business nationalize boeing topic comment made learn existence name checks thank always like learn aviation little metal structure 787 cfrp composites still fatigue fatigue behaviour far variable less understood metals mainly large variety composite materials lay resin matrix curing things vary combination could fatigue behaviour also failure modes composite delaminating resin failure fibre breakage debonding fibre matrix etc know pointed composites drilled wrong far concerning fatigue life perspective metals due catastrophic rather gradual failure modes composite though problems even major ones missing countersinks swage fasteners 3 4 grips long issue 47 section called tiger striping shims lots shim issues mostly fixed delivery deferred c check well hello mr boeing glad everywhere need go get airbus reading article sitting dreamliner taking jokes aside would like think major flaws dreamliner would identified early considering plane air 10 years despite shitshow boeing 787 pretty much safest plane sure voted terms passenger miles safest aircraft ever moment real people think whole 737 max saga well maintenance issues means planes boeing dangerous maintenance issues responsibility airline downvoted grrr boeing bad etc people conflating quality design quality manufacturing 787 design proven safe known manufacturing problems last years boeing problems raise questions better a350 machine carried passengers crash engulfed flames think point 787 crashes even accident fault 350 still counts accident agree anything demonstrated resilient safe a350 actually feat strength saying makes 787 less safe think great plane passengers flaws everywhere hardware imagine software close eyes boys girls nothing see haha oh man old airline general rule never turn completely near 100percent chance timing duty hours needing new crew came software gremlins aside sick current airline complete opposite tech read remind everyone need shutting every x amount days stop issues arrising forget exact amount though work base maintenance different airframe get reads regardless reboot interval 787s used 51 days ad probably still active avoid issues stale data piling causing trouble around 5 years since last saw one probably changed meanwhile 787 rebooted every 51 days somehow starts feeding stale data displays idea software architected developer seems absolutely insane need system filter stale data live flight displays hell stale data actively processed first place something replaying logged data whatever com bus displays use frankly seems like systems design failure technically 787 safest plane ever saying would a380 mention stat means next nothing considering new plane still 787 far passenger miles a380 a380 cracks wings flaw rolls royce engines qf32 yeah happens everywhere flying safest way travel never left one yet mean statistically yes lol bad eli5 hull losses means incidents battery issue still never led incidents 12 years old incidents opened investigation bunch people build said would fly besides one dude said thrill seeker sure confusing 787 737max video said working 787 watched last night remember feeling shocked 787 one favourite aircraft ah fair bad problem tbf read back reply could worded little nicer gt opened investigation bunch people build said would fly well people clearly proven wrong considering 13 years 40 million flight hours without major accident 787 statistically safest aircraft ever built ask engineer every aircraft flawed engineer aircraft company yes mostly flaws engineers 787 say pretty major ones big difference flaws flawed know semantics think makes big difference think biggest issue safety culture like even defects issues engineer inspected turned nothing major pretty much ignored transferred job properly boeing encouraging type culture rewarding hiring engineers overlook issues manifest massively future something super critical flying decade issue battery fires major flaw never manifests article says issue body panel alignment get pretty sloppy still function fine problem factory shennigans differ much design spec longevity assumptions go window looks like 787 need check 12 years oldest ones next couple years guess find soon whether anything time get check airframe hours even airframes encounter boundaries design envelope wrt gust loads maneuver loads hard landing loads etc pray crashes checks boeing pays much lawyers silly question alleged design life five decades 40k flights still young allegations serious us senate going hold hearings next week 787 165k cycles versus design life 44k cycles per would take everything grain salt boeing halted deliveries 2020 2022 issue still microscope faa boeing lobyists water anything gt engineers often usually people really care need signature kind problem though people care need signature type people like ones forgot put screws found procedural workaround need signature approve modification tested expected put name literally definition cutting corners classic scumbag defense well maintenance engineer opposed design boeing aircraft sure angle friend angle rushing comment section say every aircraft flawed without addressing issues whistleblower claimed seems like interest minimizing whistleblower claims mate even energy need educating hope succeed life whatever person hero celebrated instead treated like shit wonder long one convenient accident inconvenient run gun tripped fell nobody saw nothing alaska questioned found significan problems checks told look certain areas afterwards flight 261 happened wary boeing 787 seems solid battery issue 0 fatalities 0 hull losses 13 years flying 787 grounded year shimming problem fuselage joins never caused incident deliveries stopped year couple airframes service grounded issue fixed 787s already service continued flying would get fixed scheduled maintenance check airplanes buckets bolts strung together engineering production hope good pilot sadly amount incompetence growing country boeing visible example much larger problem hand acute care hospitals getting worse boeing strap gonna long ride listen cuz planes falling apart mean anything wrong 787 production cease everett 2021 would make sense reassigned 777 also transferred program program really seem like abnormal thing company big boeing manufactures different models one roof everett btw get jumping parts make fit funny maybe shocking visual let remember talking 10 000 solid one piece cfrp barrel sections could drop f150 sections doubtful deflect 1 1 000th inch reality engineering defined pull allowance probably beyond force anyone jumping imo front fallen one yet see issue really service almost 13 years already issues shortened life span surely structural damage fuselage pop one many maintenance checks decades suddenly unexpectedly happen one day mean aircraft like a380 also issues cracks fortunately identified causing trouble guess main issue gaps joined properly stresses point inspected often determine lot regarding danger aircraft get fatigue cracks parts rub wear hope aircraft inspected right time identify issues put corrective actions place salehpour attorneys said faa surprised discover complaint gaps still issue faa pretty much investigating point faa fact boeing employees faa listen whistleblowers went al jazeera care boeing getting track record whistleblowers seen probably correct taken way many years faa give shit gee flight 787 weekend eddm cyyz hope end dead like last whistleblower break bull shirt repellent thought comment engineer 787 program several years ago basically saying would never fly one edit rip whistleblower believe suicidal decided end life right calling boeing oh shit maybe keep eye one considering happened last whistleblower would time bring outside help leave faa alone people keep pointing finger boeing fact things slipping cracks exactly put confidence faa boeing would love supply consultants help worked sikorsky 1980s got transferred second shift working fast technical writer young ambitious goal slow make old fast sounds like listen boeing flying going great one 11 hours friday dude needs witness protection asap hope lasts longer last wistleblower committed suicide decade wonder gonna commit suicide wonder insurers going make expensive operate boeing fleets worked several ex boeing employees jives heard 787 line whistlerblower black bagged expected take life know boeing suicide take hotel fake death leave dead car everyone kinda accepts hitjob angry corporate culture military connections oh another preventable suicide entered top ten 2024 deadpool whistleblower better start avoiding hotel balconies longs one last whether defect cause concern repairs matter another example toxic safety culture boeing see lot company work one may kill anyone eventually one forget mcas soon attempt suicide whistleblowing another angle looking boeing trashing wins new player town comac new chinese alternative comac never get approval fly us gt another angle looking boeing trashing wins maybe people die future airplane crashes juming bend align parts boing boing boeing people know whistleblowers substantial monetary incentive stuff take stuff grain salt whole story comes course one likes wait people generally lose minds reading headline would say higher chances fired blacklisted field bankrupted lawfare employer may company gets fined dollar10 000 000 get 20percent whistle blower decent amount cash people whistleblowers generally good graces company way anyways especially true companies media lot government want make example everyone washington works emotion logic facts attorneys generally work contingent basis get 20percent cash still leaves whistleblower decent amount money similar people get axed employee claim hostile work environment way try go short term disability sue company financial incentive commit suicide boeing going excellent news days get 787 flawed aircraft good safety record beyond early battery problems seem well good would hate change saying boeing ai none going put guards around guy want find dead another boeing engineer committing suicide soon boeing shills thread damn pretty quaint retro style control columns rode one hnl today nice airplane 777 captain wait get 78 going honest like 777 guess preference fact long massive beautiful pilots perspective 787 day sure 777 bit excess grunt machine operate flight deck environment air quality christ air quality comparison absolutely 100percent agree choose though would choose 777 fly simply find majestic 787 better pax pilots comfort though 787 day 747 logbook majestic beating unless bring back concorde 100percent beautiful flight deck care much behind anymore heck could home pay right would flying king airs serious though 777 great beautiful best boeing flown said know 787 even better boeing keeps fixing things us pilots even know needed fixing ha also extra pressurization air quality goes long long way metal tube 37 000 feet 14 hours wait x uohohohoho resting shoe screen boeing

modern aircraft cleverly hidden integrated cockpit noticed easily know look quite effective works able spot adf still one actually 8 9 select one nav rad page saw sense 10 binned adf actual adf gps overlay actual adf allegedly listen sports scores ident allegedly hilarious remember piper archer 15 years ago expect plane like nice hear modern planes still use good ol adf ndb technology especially considering big passenger jet designed land big airports vor ils nobody uses vor anymore adf used radio lmao good riddance four stripes right seat wonder captain oe perhaps layman question plane makers still put throttle stick engines tradition another use actual stick instead smaller handle even guage control column able easily quickly adjust power crucial flying plane hand pilots always ability adjust thrust produced engine without look position way would want car dial instead gas pedal pilot wants able hand fly plane control thrust pitch roll yaw easily accessible without needing look input locations furthermore thrust levers give appropriate level granularity less easily achieved using something like small stick dial allows small adjustments airspeed without needing look throttle control think positioning adjust feedback feel plane indicated air speed depending situation thanks explanation appreciate understand boeing longer uses beige color instrument panel good old beaver brown fly 777 787 like much 787 lots nice bells whistles missing 777 mention lower cabin altitude fresher air choose one triple wins books prefer cdu real buttons real window shades rolled quickly larger crew rest tactile buttons less messing around mouse jumps place especially turbulent newer always better pardon mouse manage wait episode mayday horrific crash caused jittery mouse turbulence point right mouse something jumps turbulence wanted explanation mouse yes makes 0 sense trackpad control cursor cdu etc even though buy perfectly good one cheaply laptop make cursor jump around even still air required use lot 787 cdu physical buttons pilot lack physical buttons introduce level risk could avoided especially turbulence incorrect yes putting trackpad often difficult control using many basic functions solution looking problem original design called touchscreens certified faa even touchscreens would step back physical buttons even car manufacturers figured touchscreens vehicle bad idea going back real buttons switches beautiful except touchscreen fms feel like would pain touchscreen use trackpad small humps thrust levers manipulate fms still kept physical buttons though ah see stand corrected think wrong begin trackpads still pain compared real buttons gt touchscreen weird considering every fms since 737 touchscreen least guys fly think must guys think mfd touchscreen 777x touchscreens 737 max 10 well looks truly awful compared physical cdu replaced yikes would much rather real buttons would look words comment alphabetical order checked 1

traditional 1 5 15 20 25 30 cries 767 pilot going time everyone converts side stick vs yoke pilots prefer fly plane rather make suggestion computer believe happening reason everyone shift either see side stick ga noticed heavy wondering one inside knowledge knew thing sully thinks air france 447 would happened yokes junior officer stalled plane without anyone noticing late wow know advocating one clear airshow noticed lancair cirrus others side stick curious aviation transferring reason however believe sully answered yeah interviewed part tv documentary pitot tubes delivering erroneous speeds young officer right seat kept pulling nose everyone cockpit trying figure going per cvr error discovered late confusion middle night atlantic senior pilot rest period gt disastrous cockpit management still yoke though since yokes become bad thing since side sticks became thing airbus used side sticks boeing alexis used yokes boeing airbus largest commercial aviation giants ever know flown smart ass stating preference non pilot someone work hands doctor curious muscle memory works side sticks years train learn fly right hand get promoted fly left ever cause problems critical situations may need disconnect auto pilot surgery often practice skills ambidextrously beginning however clearly side predominance right hand surgeries lead surgeon stands patient right side surgical instruments right handed flip left side patient position left hand better access ergonomics right certain step professor may teaching resident operate patient left side think like check captain however need take like say airplane call switch physically switch sides person wondering yoke better sight lines different hand dominance also primarily use right hand yoke right seat left hand yoke left seat like sidestick exactly outside hand flight controls inside hand thrust levers takes couple hours adjust fine like yoke like offers nice tactile feedback pf know airbus cursor pfd feel tactile best airbus sticks digitally linked sidenote planes like g600 amp mc21 sidesticks unlike airbus digitally linked active sidesticks wiggle captain sidestick mc21 fo sidestick also wiggles excellent tactile feedback specially emergency flown yoke better every time almost everyone used prefer side stick nice foot avionics redundant analog systems 100percent digital think know asked watching lots youtube videos shown buttons entering flight plans changing radio frequency airline nice try faa haha lol plus would technically caa united kingdom aspiring aeronautical engineer caa person think lufthansa look far right display top right corner seems german registration tail xxxx flight number something like dlh7tx far tell yeah know beautiful nice haha biggest fan like many screens miss office great

time british airways dxb lhr really excited a380 far comfortable plane hate turbulence a380 feel much assume 787 also handle turbulence well given flex wings barely feel turbulence unless pretty moderate 787 handles really well hey know buttons definitely know least 2 maybe 4 thought first scifi hotel room faa want know 787s airport free take home 30 787s backyard pilots got best seat plane

fatigue enough survive aircraft entire life fatigue well studied thing aviation materials metallurgy surely planes extremely overengineered avoid catastrophic fatigue failures also constant inspection fatigue cracks replacement etc single crystal turbine blades seem issue bc flaws hard detect one fails occasionally e g southwest 1380 stopping catastrophic oscillation mean im sure account crap want

counterpoint boeing like onomatopoeia reason building generally 10 floors designed move sway wind absolutely fascinating pilot family always tells flexibility durability currently flying dreamliner coming cargo 767 even shocked saw wings flex first time worry engines wings designed endure much much plane nothing short masterpiece engineering behind amazing larger dimmable windows loud noise reducing chevrons low fuel consumption dreamliner airframe comprising nearly 50percent carbon fiber reinforced plastic composites far comfortable airliner chance fly one thing dimmable windows go completely opaque 787 flight heading west blazing late evening sun shining dimmed window six hours flying speed stopped sun fully setting long time actually loved used solar filter take photo sun pixel 8 pro caught fuckin sunspot even check told lot regulars prefer a350 flown 787 windows clever care chance fly a350 compare love flying different reasons like large dimmable windows dreamliner whereas a350s tail cams watch live feed seat interesting loved personally liked able dim cabin still bit view cabin crew disabled dimming buttons individual window liked ability choose thing crew remotely control totally get takeoff landing frustrating claustrophobic flip side benefit whole cabin gets autodimmed blazing sun prevents one person blind fully open know lot said want paid window

max 777x surprised find max least 777x ones 100 times darker blocking 99 999percent light would least alleviate problem mention reason electronic shades option 777x even though supposed block light work faster forever marvel aircraft heard lot smoother ride wingflex definitely need fly one soon flew 787 eyes nearly popped sockets watching wing flex upward takeoff heck experience even 10 hour flight felt well rested amazing plane fly mild turbulence feels like boat gently sloshing waves plane 10 000m air a350 787 marvellous planes cfrp technology amazing getting better hopefully longevity increase making things fly efficiently longer main goal flew semi similar a380 comfortable flight next pressure change cabin sensitive ears significan notly quieter take even feel like takeoff plane starts go even feel composite construction also allows higher humidity level greatly promotes comfort 10 hour flight well lower effective cabin altitude higher internal cabin air pressure means oxygen brain means less fatigue apparently awesome love 787 despite recent debacle boeing fly 787 777 feel better 787 flight would take 777 every day pilot composite frame allows higher pressurization due tensile strength closer sea level higher humidity metallic oxidation concerns dreamliner indeed let know get pilot 777x true comparison honestly seem make much difference cabin pressure start flight around 6000 cabin alt difference 787 stays level entire long haul flight 777 slowly creeps upwards step climb lot noise reduction actually ultra high bypass ratio engine creates sound cushioning airflow buffer around engine mostly serendipitous byproduct fuel efficient engine design far tell 747 experience airbus leans towards stiffer designs boeing tends allow flex perfectly safe record design philosophy difference safety quality difference yeah 744 amazing wing flex kinda surprised 748 nearly amount flex could feel bit stiffer turbulence asked pilots flight felt way affirmed 748 rougher ride yeah know happens know completely meant still makes uncomfortable see wing flex watch engines wobble like remember seeing properly first time a380 flying turbulent air way kuala lumpur genuinely thought engines going fall geee flex ge strongest wings business really something see action able watch wing stress test finally broke wing took insane amount force way past flex even engineers planned remember weirded overhead bins shook like cocktail mixer landed flapping wings stay air common sense still blows mind able model fatigue composites well enough produce faa certified widebody mid 2000s amazing access dod research personnel get private sector forget hiring former faa employees actually probably pretty strict firewall around dod data would never get permission export plane composites dod want exported really tech dod funded develop strategic tactical advantage access engineers one point worked dod projects another story pretty much point razor cut implication meant former dod personnel specifically individuals experience dod materials intend mean access actual classified dod docs specific enough avoid conclusion someone translate passengers sub composite two materials put together become new improved material commonly used aerospace industry carbon fiber fiber glass reinforcing kind resin specifics fibers resin vary general structures much lighter resistance compared traditional materials aluminium instance fatigue structure subjected loadings vary time instance wings flexing turbulence cabin pressurised depressurised every flight suffer phenomenon called fatigue tiny cracks may arise get aggravated eventually fails structure designed take account resistance fatigue depends several factors keep simple make structure fail due fatigue inconceivably large amount time making essentially practical applications infinite useful lifetime need model mathematical one going run computer simulation equations tell us materials structures behave several conditions accurate result complex long modelling structure thing composite materials behave particular ways makes notoriously hard model mathematically thus makes hard get accurate results simulations impressive boeing guys actually good job modelling composite structures 787 also work around difficulties computer models many simulations confirmed real life testing gives empirical results needed full trust design questions failed make clear feel free ask right surprising mid 2000s models really gotten much better 15 20 years honest give precise answer accuracy models 20 years ago since 3 tell learning aerospace engineering school become considerably better last years although composites use several decades basic math underlying even older extensive use composites whole structure relatively recent application theory might also trickier one would imagine demand rises research much research made around composites recently also computers get powerful simulations many feasible powerful computers lastly also due company experience material working simulations give answer whether right wrong engineering team figure job well done recent focus composites high end products aerospace industry things improved significan notly past years also composites isotropic like plastic metal stronger directions others making computationally complex simulate carbon glass fiber instance yes tried keep simple possible exactly right due composite materials also present weird deformation modes instance applying axial force get bend happen isotropic materials adds complexity model e g f1 cars direction carbon fibre weaved matters aerodynamics possible yeah say sure know little f1 aerodynamics know make good use aeroelasticity effects use natural deformation wings due aerodynamic forces improve aerodynamics car linked way deform thus way built aircraft also built massive safety factors respect fatigue sure top head iirc well 100x safety factor calculated sure much better gotten certainly time fatigue composites poorly understood planes component safety factors 2 due weight budget constraint true load factors fatigue tolerance lot higher materials either improve fatigue isafety factor increasing inspection replacement frequency etc right though fatigue normally called isafety factor used language people know means yeah guy engineers today stress analyst runs fem laptop lunch 20 years ago would taken dedicated high performance machine two days solve fem model moore law edit clarity think desktop pc early 2000s phone hand blows water terms compute power others mentioned computing power committed approximately 32x powerful today 20 years ago another thing keep mind known equations models since 60s 70s refinements 80s 90s 00s 10s even still today still gathering data actually feed simulate mechanical structure really anything need computing resources mathematical models empirical data materials studied example subsonic fluid simulation run powerful desktop commuter today models subsonic well understood entire databases fluid properties like specific weight specific volume surface tension viscosity etc values different temperatures pressures today 2000s databases rare probably proprietary 90s 80s probably like tables charts interpolate values actually wanted pray weird phenomenon existed right values interpolating running simulations computationally expensive today computer resources rare would simplify models simulations engineers essentially share computers mainframes running simulations could

family know next nothing airplanes maybe entirely obvious mean geometrically limited rtation like something else doens allow rotate much stall speed perhaps hmm okay explains bit think fully get yet shorter aircraft situation lower speed longer aircraft higher speed right consideration determines minimum speed like minimum speed generate enough lift remain airborne climbing falling either check last thing true understand things correctly shorter aircraft immediately rotate take angle tail hit ground start getting ground longer aircraft accelerate bit take lower angle going faster thus produce lift angle e need lower angle get ground correct plane geometrically limited lift nose still accelerate ground wing generates enough lift angle attack get plane ground may seconds later plane geometrically limited take tail strike happen second point correct first part determines minimum speed start rotate lift generated wing weight plane wing generate certain amount lift depending speed faster plane goes lift wing generates big plane may weigh may still take speed small plane due wing designed plane tail skids show long stretched models first 737 tiny short little plump looking said

a319 first thing thought huh smells like new car casual flyer stepped onto swa flight month ago 6ft got door plane noticed smell jetway entered plane asked flight attendant plane new said first revenue flight take someone said smell like new car idk new planes burn nose hairs source worked boeing someone tell one button next switch makes plane go faster many concord sr71 made completely sr71 cockpit consisted entirely one giant button labeled shred x 15 bigger button labelled long slowpoke also presumably painted bright red seat back made buttons faster pressed fast think talking chem trails button touch auto position chemtrail switch switch lol r whoosh whoooshed ejection seat unruly passengers meanwhile 737 land say engineers took shotgun overhead panel 737 737 epitome ai broke fix happens put fe panel ceiling well faa another regulator say allowed grandfather design panel staying 737 pilots wish flying dc 3 leather jacket atc even existed sadly a320 better much cohesive design abnormal situations light go switches push button type whereas 737 mainly toggle switches lot logical layout think boeing got schooled overhead design a320 made big influence 777 design still better md95 oh agree poking bit fun really know read overhead panel 320 737 look similarly daunting flew md95 two years overhead design leaps bounds better 737 clean love magnetic compass matter advanced computerized planes get always 2nd star right straight til morning gauge case else fails airline guy also airplane one first things remove stupid whiskey compass vertical compass card much nicer something breaks least use real granted one primary hsi plane everything airline world least two learned 787 777 share type rating makes sense seeing similar panels yeah really nice little bit training type rating applied planes good boeing save costs benefits pilots airlines well maybe passengers also lol really benefit pilots remember 2 sets limits procedures small differences yes benefit airline thankfully airline operates 777 amp 787 runs separate fleets sticker reminding holy shit airplane fall sky tweet article cringey reminds people thought whole y2k thing would make aerodynamics magically stop working planes would fall ground well lose control systems completely difference academic point think ram air system hydraulics etc etc want guy prove works test kinds thing extensively plane gets market true yay something designed wiring harnesses connect units proud aww ever take step back adore sexy overhead panel sooooooo clean panel yes flight deck yes entire aircraft yes p5 overhead panel loved whole experience come switch smoking lights assume always nope couple iterations since smoking sign first replaced electronic devices sign plane wifi light let know available damn

chance would think would though cockpits amazing pleasing see us pilots met quire friendly got lots shots cockpits second question yes cockpit options vary airline airline say us airline might want use pounds gallons fahrenheit airlines might use kilograms litres celsius varies airline airline edit typo much could take picture told put social media yeah mph americans kmh rest suppose labels would different hardware though though might less depending budget maybe leave blinkers carpets picture almost cockpits internet usually given folks build one nos button flew united 787 sfo ppt november best flying experience ever hands living dream sitting upfront pretty neat bit simpler would see 738 way simpler 767s ship liking boeing seems following airbus footsteps terms reducing many things human operator mess 737 bit odd one updating panel would require new type rating airlines want finally retired 737 oddness remain h panel requires new type rating cause engine monitor gauges totally changed og ng winglet max generations think pedestal fair bit different overall well relieving cockpits becoming increasingly pilot friendly coming 707 1950s pretty much switches late 2010s 787 upcoming 777x also look cooler aesthetic aviation enthusiasts let face older cockpits way less pilot user friendly makes things look sexier yes used word lol 20 30 40 years ago shit zombie apocalypse could guy ged give em hell attitude get one things flying chance amount system knowledge required would extremely difficult comprehend without actual aviation knowledge flying experience nice still take bus one missing 787 funny story picture almost 14 years old picture taken 7 8 07 day first 787 rolled public everett aircraft would take skies months later explains bunch thanks years later 747 8 787 think every airframe 707 different 707 looks right first thought wow looks like kc 135 realized dumb fun fact 135 707 descended 367 80 like 707 subtlety different enough dimensions control surfaces etc internal boeing designation 717 relation md bastard name see photo also seperate kc 707 israel others purchased yep actually 707 photo privately owned refueling tanker omega okay thought 135 aswell idea 707 big awesome see relative others perspective distort much really large plane 707 120 757 200 pretty similar size paper use taxiway lines compare wingspans 707 727 737 757 share basic fuselage cross section fuselage diameter totally right 727 737 757 trace lineage back 707 pedantic share upper lobe fuselage kind two semicircles smushed together fuselage cross section 777 boeing first fully round fuselage lower part passenger deck pretty different 757 far different 4 different nose profile designed fit cockpit almost identical 767 allow common type rating interestingly lower lobe fuselage behind wing actually taller lower fuselage front one curiosity common lineage trace 737max recent problems way back layout choices made 707 80 really 727 developed 707 737 727 good reason deviate much landing gear height first designed 50s short landing gear made accommodate low bypass turbofans time exactly made 737 use radical solutions throughout life accommodate larger engines concluded tragic mcas problem deviating lower landing gear height make sense would made 737 unusable lot airports time jet bridges jet bridges small accommodate taller aircraft also manual baggage loading small airports probably trick eye angle camera amp lens since 707 sized fuselage 727 amp 737 know mean big distortion probably coming shape taxiway intersection single aisle though think gt aircraft would take skies months later months later mean two years later 2 years 24 months math checks thank reddit neat airliner pic 720 720 got weird nomenclature part shorter 707 today would get special designation like 707 500 whatever boeing really finalized numbering system passenger jets yet point 720 really need featured separately like show three generations 737 existed time right 720 sorta idea went 737sp one many md95 talking boeing 717 md95 called merger 717 dc9max mean integrated lineup deserves spot much boeing concorde airbus nothing except stickers boeing similar cseries a220 real 717 version 707 boeing absolutely input design md95 acquired rebranded merger shut c 17 also boeing name alone reasons though obviously pictured md 90 fit whole mix people know 717 today developed completely md md 95 latest kid dc 9 family essentially slightly shorter md 90 modernized cockpit meant commonality md 11 brand new engines still find promotional images

b717 got rebranded boeing md 90 production well underway time mcdonnell douglas became part boeing md 95 b717 yet entered service boeing rebranded one fact broader dc 9 family went many major name changes 737 family simply product builders marketed planes mcdonnell douglas renaming time boeing kept using number even though 4th generation 737 essentially dc 9 md 80 md 90 717 variants plane line still uses original type cert reason still call 717 dc 9 agree interesting name changes made flying public treat version separate plane notable delta past 10 years retired dc 9 md 80 amp md 90 however barely noted retired 737 200 737 300 since already 737 800 ask dc 9 era delta truly end retire 717 thank yes thank photos also include 787 2016 100th anniversary lineup amp x200b amp x200b fun fact boeing 727 used lineup n7001u prototype 727 first 727 ever built gt fun fact boeing 727 used lineup n7001u prototype 727 first 727 ever built prototype first one built crazy looks like dc 3 parked

bank angles seem produce equal turn rates turn rate factor speed bank angle size since two traveling speed banking angle turn rate thanks actually certain true physics education flight experience thought long time put comment answer satisfied mind one depends aircraft lift weight relationship thinking would happenstance anything else answer end would follow f 16 a380 would turn rate long set bank angle speed would know would like hear someone aircraft engineering expertise settle question good thing aerospace engineering student happens would direct reference supports conclusion explain true highly counter intuitive see phak page 5 22 5 23 short version turn caused imbalanced horizontal force horizontal force horizontal component lift imagine moment actually spinning airplane long string constantly turning also staying aloft feel tugging hands turns know let go fly away tugging horizontal component lift must provided turn real airplane also need force rate radius turn rotating object normally impacted mass well however vertical component lift must equal mass times gravity law similar triangles mass cancels logic rate radius turn longer impacted mass leaves two variables velocity bank angle questions feel free ask understand force vector math use extreme example decreased wing surface a380 much would provide barely enough lift get plane airborne case given airspeed lateral force vector produced given bank angle would less would wing produced greater lift lesser lateral force component could modified aircraft turn rate unmodified aircraft assuming weight airspeed understand wing producing barely lift needed get airborne even slight bank would lead stall unless increased airspeed wing generates lift bank since turn airplane keep might help know equations lift turn rate lift 0 5 coefficient lift density air airspeed 2 surface area wing rate turn airspeed 2 11 26 tan bank angle rate turn assumes wing provide lift necessary large coefficient lift depends wing design higher airspeed larger wings waiting someone pull equation intro aero level stuff quite rocket science see establishes two aircraft sufficient wing area maintain lift turn turn equal rate

would seeing like house flies order heavy twins like buy candy tomorrow say big enough could boeing make longer also make 777neo hurry go airbus well ordered quad engine double deckers like candy well due location planet make whale work dxb perfect midpoint us airline interested recall yeah a380 really option us carriers like 5 6 different hubs opposed one two still nuts think half a380s went emirates though 123 emirates a380s 251 made good bot thanks even better bot kept programs head water sure even pushing neo version iirc airbus one time debating version blended winglets gt order heavy twins like buy candy gt gt tomorrow say big enough could boeing make longer also make 777neo hurry go airbus hey ge know engines trouble supplying us yeah want new one hahahahaha noob question a380 largely commercial failure given size failed hub spoke model big boy success magic sweat spot requiering specific changes airports one important difference 777x twinjet consumes much less fuel quadjet a380 based limited understanding correct generalize larger radius jet engine fuel efficient two smaller ones making combined thrust yep bypass air never really able get head around know true intuitively understand jet engine pulls air compresses multiple stages adds fuel ignites creates explosion forcing rotation engine core keeps engine spinning cabin pressurised throws exhaust back propelling nozzle creates thrust without nozzle gas turbine generator oversize outer fan blades put shroud around end sucking air around outside turbine bypassing gets thrown back also providing thrust get hung thrust reactive force throwing mass direction throw ball small reactive force pushes opposite direction throw ton air back jet engine opposing equal force acting engine propel forward thrust coming engine core pressure temperature would think velocity air gone literal fan ignited compressed high bypass engine improve efficiency missing ignore cowling second enormous propeller bigger propeller moves air given rotational rate smaller propeller fuel burn move air ge others looking concept called propfan efficient compressor generates thrust cool get add thrust produced fan blades bigger fan equals greater air movement would true even electrically powered fan want biggest fan get wings already combustion might well move much air since get thrust equivalent fuel burn free thrust get mechanical losses drag penalties far efficient using additional air burn fuel e grammar got thanks begs question original jet engines bypass complexity struggling make basic concept jet engines working consistently reliably early days without throwing additional design considerations bypass turbojet design matured enough engineers began look ways improve efficiency resulted bypass turbofan materials science goes blades within engine bonkers like without innovations would stuck back smokey jet engines early days make whole engine shroud compressor would also drastically increase weight fuel consumption engine would really increase rpm engine determined exhaust gasses driving fan exit engine turn drives shaft engine since shaft given rpm might well try move extra air adding extra fan blades minor drag torque penalty amount fuel burnt move way air efficient engine mass bypass move larger amount air mass conceptual understanding relies thinking pressure speed produce thrust true comparing area bypass much larger area core moves much air mass okay right would make engine bigger send air core advantage using air spin engine core efficient produces lots excess torque using torque drive bypass converts fuel energy thrust without letting excess torque go waste interesting way look thanks less efficient produce thrust ducting air core engine compared bypassing air around many reasons make engine bigger big ones run problems ground clearance difficult expensive produce inherent limit big engine get fan size increases blade tip speed blade tip speed starts approaching supersonic region kinds shit starts happen better exhaust lot air mass slight velocity increase small amount air mass high velocity increase might lead thrust force latter case lot kinetic energy exhaust air complete waste related fact kinetic energy exhaust air proportional mv thrust proportional mv limited way think pure turbojets used ton excess noise heat driving bypass fan way push energy momentum fuel also simple economics engine core much complex multiple compressor stages complicated cooling systems scaling means much expensive engines also need fuel turn much bigger engine core also stable combustion run everything super lean essence large bypass engines almost turboprops cowling around force change momentum f v get v use energy per kinetic energy 1 2 v 2 v goes higher energy required per thrust e f v efficiency 1 v e efficient less acceleration air limited physical constraints extra weight cost larger fans amount air moved high bypass fan astounding thrust gas turbine used drive fan axial configuration non axial configuration like turbo prop plane turbine helicopter use thrust turbine drive another fan connected output shaft drives propeller huh never thought rotor blades helicopter like high bypass engine without cowling see usefulness logically separating fan function engine function even like plane mounted shaft explanations okay focus physics yes bypass ratio important ratio different engine sizes reason larger diameter fans still efficient drag drag pcav 2 2x speed 4x drag larger fan push amount air slower rpm exponential consequences drag surface area engine cooling fan air hot core colder fan air dense means mass means thrust also engine weight difference efficiency use materials lazy get increase engine size less material per horsepower needed certainly lower part count doubling number engines instead basically answers go back basic geometry engine diameter volume surface area fan speed bypass ratio lot people given good answers try understand intuitively think second forget engine works think thermodynamics way actually thinking backwards imagine second engine black box burns fuel exhausts air burn amount fuel exhaust hot high pressure gas back engine throwing overboard lot potentially useful energy converted forward motion fact ideal would exhaust gas ambient temperature pressure would extracted usable energy fuel burned pressure fairly easy deal really function geometry exhaust nozzle high performance turbojets rocket engines exhaust pressure designed around ambient pressure cruising altitude tell observing form run near sea level even powerful engine exhaust actually squeezed atmosphere static pressure less one atmosphere point exit exhaust gas still hotter ambient temperature wasting energy one way think high bypass turbofan actually way decrease average temperature exhaust gas makes efficient jet engine makes plenty power needs keep spinning attach blades push air simultaneously helping keep core cooler make even power remember reading jet engines limited efficiency materials made could make something strong heat resistant enough could make really amazing thrust efficiency bypass air next best thing lot said general bigger engines efficient smaller engines see everything cargo ships power generation think bypass fan portion turbofan big propeller rest turbine hot core part mostly engine turns propeller fan area increases exponentially diameter increases fuel burn required turn bigger fan thus bigger bypass fan efficient smaller one given amount fuel used ahhh okay yes terms fuel per unit thrust efficient drive big fan must limit big fan current designs already supersonic blade tips went even bigger would become limiting perhaps engine manufacturers developing turbofans reduction gears fan core plus half maintenance engines think would cost lot given complexity a380 much larger plane really slightly shorter heavier larger wingspan taller max passengers 414 vs theoretical max 853 a380 means actually relatively airports a380 use code f vs e 777x limits routes therefore flexibility airports gates a380 use also expensive main issue though fuel efficiency 4 engine design a380 dates pre 2000 fuel prices huge issue current climate a380 expensive run needs basically full time turn profit means routes like london dubai worthwhile finding 800 passengers routes guaranteed 777x efficient engines 2 engine design naturally efficient less maintance intensive disadvantages safety a380 niche plan versatile shame though a380 comfortable plane ever flown

get home one way scene craaash robert schimmel tater salad engines turn people swim baby crew actually announce smoke cockpit yes wow would expect announce actual reason maybe landing requirement announce exact reason something likely o2 masks ran qrh waiting fuel get right weight landing also probably good idea explain seeing picture passengers especially extra time thanks explanation fly

idea differently uk haha let even get started correct side road p touch iron tocca ferro italy gotta google touching wood lot connotations us depends never ever technical issue know fuck smoke overweight landing screw dumping fuel think depends captain flown tell passengers exactly going literally make shit sound bad actually happening tend honest unless issue one knows times keep within crew reason worry people like reason worry people attitude ever actually worried like ah engine failure worries another one ladies gentlemen captain speaking small problem four engines stopped damnedest get going trust much distress lol read actually happening one time think singapore airlines silk air engines spark forgive thats wrong term plane descended 12000ft think pilots went procedure get restarted scary edit ok called flameout quote actual quote captain flight thinking british airways flight 9 know thought singapore also happened british airways 747 flew volcanic ash lol worried airline world recently really bad windshear dropped 900 feet 400 feet engines max thrust said really think worried right word really focused flying plane ground afterwards something along lines holy fuck adrenaline anything depends bingo scheme running board know stupid safe dump fuel atmosphere great immediately evaporates long safe altitude usually 6000ft nobody tell difference compared environmental damage caused fossil fuel usage worldwide fine quick explanation planes required dump fuel land shortly takeoff especially long distance flights combined weight passengers freight luggage fuel makes plane heavier maximum landing weight normally much lower maximum takeoff weight normally burn fuel arrive light enough land due technical failure etc land early fuel dumping necessary normally designated areas allowed fuel reach ground immediately gets broken uv light environmental influences rest gets diluted course still bad environment least sure due high cost airlines shits giggles hydrocarbons generally close harmless low concentrations bacteria consume quickly risk human animal consumption high concentrations crude oil fouling everything instance leaky underground storage tanks generally monitored impact water sources risk contamination let break naturally occurrs pretty quickly vocs heavier molecular components hydrocarbons remain need remediation using specialized equipment burn soil create bacteria lab target area aerate soil host remediation techniques leaving ugst situ leaking result leak magically become solved guy epa use air compressor contamination site work one way woods apparently used dumping used use aggressive chemicals aerating could use forced air aerobic oxygen decomposition much faster wich bacteria example aromatic oil dilution solution pollution planes capable dumping need fly around burn fuel instead situation warrants immediate landing like medical emergency sort progressive failure continued flight risks degrading serious condition land safely overweight yeah max landing weight generally based 600 700fpm descent rate touchdown basically stable approach flare provided flare normally aircraft touchdown safely max takeoff weight dump passengers instead would environmentally friendly liability issues passengers evaporate way also hurts return business thrilled seeing plane dumping lot fuel triggered concern environment save everyone else life think okay oh boy concerned environment hearing places like india china exist really going bum know us meh really considering us second largest producer co2 world emissions per capita twice high china ten times india yes really per capita argument great measurement case china india huge populations people produce almost co2 emissions populations also huge since many people gets diluted better comparison would look china middle upper class vs us case even close gt better comparison would look china middle upper class vs us case even close got sources trying call curious wouldent need source stating fact pretty low level common sense assume would better comparison atleast us something besides c02 emissions also among others water pollution china others far worse compared us looking raw c02 output enough afters decades environmental destruction steps feign deliberation enough across history nations usa far clear leader destruction environment long long margin also curious would think gulf mexico injected unholy amount oil spill guilty company bought called usa authorities regulators would happen dump fuel say crusing attitude still evaporates higher altitude would mean lower pressure yes would still evaporate altitude evaporate hitting ground low altitude might cause stink since speed pretty spread minor smell fuel much like would smell around airport safer anyway potential crash runway excursion overweight landing fly replacement plane repair crew potentially writing plane exactly environmentally sound either difference whiff like smell airports everywhere vs getting bucket stuff poured personally mind smell much well visuals may seem extreme fuel would otherwise burned released atmosphere anyway sure would surprised dumping fuel actually less polluting burning releasing emissions atmosphere would imagine would worse ground pollution like rivers lakes vs air pollution atomizes evaporates getting ground plane would need fairly low altitude liquid fuel actually hit anything believe anything 5000 feet fine atomize 3000 feet problem heard jfk relatively new pilot got little antsy flame started dumping immediately

wait broke sound barrier 767 mph guess high altitude pose issues air frame barrier ftfa amp x200b gt might notice something 801 mph reading speed sound 767 mph commercial aircraft ordinarily break sound barrier designed handle sudden increase drag aerodynamic effects associated speeds despite ground speed high plane come close reaching threshold embedded swiftly moving air amp x200b like warp bubble sound light like air moving jet air moving 200mph relative ground plane moving usual 600mph relative air relative ground plane moving 800mph aha understand finally reading comments got thank mentour pilot great video overspeed amp x200b edit video coffin corner air around jet moving faster 801mph speed sound shitty explanation strong tailwind going exactly direction aircraft plane still subsonic riding 200mph ish wind direction speed sound constant depends temperature speed sound air mph 33 5 sqrt 459 fahrenheit temperature sqrt anyone curious speed sound defined sqrt rt gamma air 1 4 r gas constant temperature gas inside jet engines even high speed gas coming combustor low mach number since v high temperature since mach number velocity speed sound going faster speed sound sea level must specify temperature type gas speed sound sea level 760 mph obviously changes altitude velocity always relative velocity 200 mph tailwind would 960 mph break sound barrier would change altitude would able hit 960 mph 787 entered steep dive say 8 000 fpm looked standard atmosphere tables 35 000 ft speed sound 660 mph needed reach 860 mph ground track 200 mph tailwind yes close would dangerous structurally aerodynamic loading care speed mach number reynolds number deals turbulence stuff actually predict air affect surfaces important note would like running 210 mph 200 mph train c ground track really doesnt affect anything except soon pax arrive sorry speak freedom units side iron curtain calculate sqrt gamma r glorious kelvin wasnt explanation question whole airmass moving fast close sound barrier airplane thanks sucks get downvoted question guess dumb common misconception dumb question ground speed vs true airspeed kind hard wrap mind around familiar imagine running forward one moving walkways airport pilot wondering thing well student pilot great question though fascinating concept really basically sound equivalent warp travel edit ok worded carelessly assuage u lysandersporker concerns understand concepts fine wondering maybe 5 seconds worked however still good question people discouraged asking well fair asked question high school physics teacher gave wrong answer afraid conservative christian school cared bible science still read interesting makes perfect sense cool gave original question upvote try help lol respect possible jet abruptly exit airmass would briefly become supersonic literally pushed wind tas mach number change tailwind goes 200kts zero lose groundspeed airplane still flying speed pretty sure incorrect air instantly stopped moving happen groundspeed would remain airspeed would increase conservation momentum would course quickly reduce back original airspeed basically dynamic soaring works correct right answering practical sense losing tailwind instantaneous think answer correct explanation wrong plane could somehow pass invisible wall would stop 250 mph tailwind plane breaks still air groundspeed would remain would suddenly supersonic pretty obvious explanation happen air nearly never changes speeds quickly find kind speed gradient turbulence shear would extremely intense makes sense context jet stream graphic see next weather man fast would going indicated air speed honestly pay much attention indicated airspeed transition mach somewhere range 230 260 indicated mach 77 85 faster guys bearing mind high pressure altitudes low temperatures ias could well hundred knots eas mach numbers used altitude tas exceeding critical mach number becomes lot lower speed sound decreases cold air flew philly michigan last

true airspeed indicated airspeed use mph looks like ground speed math conversion 696 kts gs man 642 kts gs 737 last week blow water 801 indicated airspeed would blow wings plane think rule one 801 true airspeed probably decent chance mach 1 probably want check bad could get 806 700 kts someone tell tail winds actually pushes aircraft like jet going 560mph speed tail winds 200mph wind pushing slower jet granted pilot someone exceeded 2nd level high school math guy enjoys planes engineering power maybe something getting trying imagine running outside slight wind back feeling like getting

spacious mega jealous pax rule usually tends bigger plane sucks a380 best plane ever flew people tend like sucks like way sucks think hate wait till drive would seat ever move fast enough cause sudden change altitude thought never seen power seat move fast counter impact comprehend could result control input abrupt enough create violent maneuver smells fishy seems like boeing needs someone blame crew perhaps activities flight deck caused sudden control input pilot would bet dollar1k happened seat moved forward pilot tried push back bracing stick thus pushing nose want believe hah bird brained pilot sitting cross legged reported perhaps kicked stick accidentally panic terrible betting electric seat need brace anything manual controls allow push feet floor provide enough opposing force guess pilot knee another body part directly yoke would sure cause control input really imagine would lead violent dive 787 rated either airbus apply slight force joystick without disconnecting ap disconnect means gone certain threshold meaning input onto stick already negligible hence initial abrupt movement theory applies boeing sure nose moment caused seat pushing forward leg pilots would try pull would last maybe one second maybe realise cruise phase hungry smelling meal approaching remember time nose input continues realise blocks control column move seat pull huge negative pitch course leg moved control column affected pilot would know right away would start moving seat backwards without investigation time thinking exact thing likely degenerate immoral acts inside cockpit cause seems quite likely maybe fa jumping pilot seen anything yet made much sense flew plane back across pacific ocean plunged previously without waiting investigation much sense mean fishy got fdr cvr plane seems fine got pilots interview reason keep plane new zealand think attempting say sudden nose pitch caused something pilots could control would risk fly plane large body water hours upon hours maybe either airline knew pretty quick due pilot commands b really mind risking sacrificing crew get plane back mean got fdr readouts crew statements must obvious plane fine water better land amirite absolutely fcs failure suspected lmao cycled jet stale data gone safe gotta suicide pilot fa good right heard issue communicated years ago needed keep plane running certain number days errors like could occur fixed software upgrade latam never got airworthiness directive relating talk loss controls sudden commanded control inputs potential problem even plane left powered 51 days straight says certain instruments may show unreliable outputs pilots without indicator invalid google uncommanded descent b787 stale data even make screens freeze yes except shutdown would cause plane go dive would input would let plane glide bit theory chair makes much sense pilot fucked maybe would instead blame instruments seems likely blaming flight attendant managers make living shifting blame software problems answer tbh seriously never want get another boeing plane anyone picture button death 787 drivers ever move seat far go hopefully parked seems unlikely unless captain big ol beer belly video show seat movement switch different directions actually seem move relatively quick fuck flight attendant hit accident pretty safe design non 787 pilot speculation pilot made boneheaded maneuver pushed

clip sped move slow would expect neither show talking need see move seat forward let say pilot uses switch videos move seat back pilot sits move seat forward seated position watch second video 787 driver seat move fast buy story trying imagine scenario anyone else would tight yoke inadvertent activation switch would cause seem likely seat moves faster manual mode via levers side seat use seat slides freely along tracks per previous comment sitting cross legged second seat starts moving would say something would stop requires decent amount force push autopilot control disengage via yoke movement plausible yes likely think even tray caught yoke button got stuck stay flight controls sensitive pushing stick forward speed would violently snap nose stick pushed beyond autopilot resistance would snap like really believe blaming power seat bit jolt associated override forcefully push servos see violently nosing aircraft speculation behalf mind really make lot sense assuming auto pilot

incident like guessing back cabin assess damage injuries good point leaving cockpit potentially broken plane come cabin landing medical crews board pilot came back cabin landing medical crews onboard oh know screens went blank pilots say instead life flashed eyes posted video another comment lightning fast already pretty close might take much start running room slammed forward probably see screens might well blank lol yeah wondering seat also could malfunctioned remember one incident seat lock broke captain fell backwards maybe seat broken found switch pressed still reconcile different testimonies tho look qrh night mentions displays blank first thing ensure autopilot basic modes eg heading alt gets reset ccr wondering sort systems failure leading ccr rebooting caused pitch would lnav vnav mention cover guess either means broken flight attendant made terrible choice cover article remember pilot saying screens shut lost control previous quote doesnt line rumor serving meal yeah

787 mech though speculation know lie know going found follow investigation makes worse also fact pilot would knowingly lie something serious bit unsettling fair know pilot lied even said anything media saying passenger said pilot said good point make worse lying investigators would one thing lying passengers crime whole lot pilots ought worried screens going blank moment bs bs moment said

cover switch lift push switch side make seat move maybe cover broken missing something think personal record downvotes possible special livery applied kept wrapped official unveiling tail section masked rest would typically remove stuff paint shops typically use sort paper based masking product instead plastic fuselage stripped coatings needs spend time outside covered exposed fuselage uv

ordinary scenario also counting flight attendants light people often belts scenario sure people seems dumb click sitting going absolutely nowhere people value comfort safety time especially overestimate safety nothing ever happened previous 100 times belt airplane scenarios like caused always purchase ticket young children bring car seat rather holding infant lap imagine would happened infant someones lap flight straight overhead bins keeping belt simple thing keep safe crazy situations people even even cost comfort effort though similar level though dangerous turning headlights rain people anything safety unless somebody makes seat belts aircraft uncomfortable though already stuck tiny seat like belt really make worse people dumb apes really comes literally cannot even feel seatbelt cranked moronically even loose configuration keep flying seats wear seatbelt seatbelt sign recommended us strongly recommended wear seatbelt times unless seat go restroom stretch get something overhead bin whenever fly personal observance everybody keeps seatbelt everybody read seen stories people flying plane unexpected turbulence sudden plane maneuvers seems dumb wear agreed
