      "you need to be online with it that is one way of them accessing information like face scans to be sent back to china for evaluation i have lack of trust when electronics ask to be on line amp ask for more personal details before you can use it they are locking up these devices to their stores games controllers vr should be open platform so you can buy controllers including specialty gun like for any device you should also be able to play steam vr games regardless of your vr headset if they do not standardize these things vr is not going to be popular at leas nowhere near as popular as regular consoles the middle fingers that is the real test did not apple copy these guys who also checked his steam inbox 7 19 hi this head set have some sort of lag in games in wireless mode i buyed reverb g2 and sell it a few months ago because the lenses become blurry after minutes of use highly reluctant to give facebook my hard earned cash made my mind up pico 4 it is great review mate what about the quest 3 the quest 3 has full colour past through and no fish eye small controllers so you do not clash them together and the headset is so much smaller so it is so much more portable to take around so let me do the math here regarding the controllers after a quick google search you can see that a double a battery has a capacity of 1800 to 2700mah at 1 5v let is be realistic and land on a 2400mah battery for a very decent one an economical 18650 lithium ion battery that has a great capacity is the samsung 35e or something 3500mah at 3 6v so 1 5 2400 3 6wh 3 6 3500 12 6wh so say you are a dedicated gamer you play vr games for more than 10 hours per week every week you will have to pay about 4dollar for batteries at the end of the first year will have paid more than 200dollar maybe even 250dollar for batteries d how much is a samsung 35e 3dollar 6dollar for two controllers so why do not they put 18650s in there weight no 2 aa batteries is 46grams 1 18650 is 48grams xd charging controller and type c port literally 1dollar or less manufacturing cost so why environmental concerns surely after 200 batteries thrown in your trash per year this is not realistic so i rest my case they are just stupid they do not get that 4 aa batteries for the two controllers is a considerable expense if they are used frequently good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life reasons why to not get the pico 4 you can not play gorilla tag on it theres chances of ur vr lenses being a peice of crap pico is more expensive then oculus since you can get a oculus online that is fine for 100dollar while pico costs 430dollar and its made for more slimmer noses then fatter noses so if you have a bigger nose you can not do anything about it hi i am planning to buy this one i would like to ask how harmful it is for the eyes and neck thank you my friend for the detailed explanation but you forgot to talk about screen resolution when watching movies bruh this is like meta stealing picos style does the pico 4 pro have eye and face tracking im unsure on this so the quest 3 but objectivally worse is it compatible with ps5 quest 2 quest 3 quest pro pico 4 i am looking at getting one but need to know what it is like if you wear glasses also is it good for watching films and tv just got one as my first headset really good but the standalone games are actually terrible so i use it with steam if i knew i would only use it with steam i probably would have saved up for a bit longer probably would have gone mad waiting for a headset and gotten a valve index even though it is heavy or a bigscreen when it comes out maybe even a quest 3 since it is lighter but not as balanced whts the pico library now for games and apps does pico vr pc connect require a good pc or it runs on pico i purchased a local chinese copy and want to use it in africa is it possible that i will encounter problems while downloading games and updating the system do not get why people giving such hate on the built in audio it was 10x better then what all the reviews are saying about it standalone games library is still poor tho 12 months after release and no mod support for games like contractors kinda sucks plus still no pavlov shack thanks for saying what the company making this also makes it actually has gorilla tag  love pico but wavy lenses 14 21 publisher is bytedance hence i do not recommend this headset research the actions they have committed then decide if you would give money to company like that cheers quest 2 killer 50 bucks more expensive hahaha would this be a good headset if i just wanted to see dirty movies it was dead on arrival it has now been a year since the release of the pico 4 how does it play now can it vrchat eurosgbp dollar he sound like joshdub basically tik toks attempt to get 1 up on facebook savage puppy attack if gorilla tag can be accessed i am happy apparently the bluetooth lag was fixed awesome the only company worse than facebook about invading your privacy and taking your information is the competitor to facebook oh how lucky we are to be able to give away our right to privacy ive returned my pico 4 because its almost impossible to pirate games on it i just want anything thats not oculus they give me so many issues and can not fix a single one my headset has become a brick nope none of that china garbage facebook bad china worse bytedance can suck it nahhh tic tac what is a good vr headset budget friendly to connect to laptops for adult content thanks sell your data to the zucc or to china pick your poison i just want a standalone vr headset that i can start using without any accounts and that doesnt have yet another proprietary software store that requires developers to support it creating yet another ecosystem but works seamlessly with all vr games out of the box regardless of where they were purchased something like an android for vr no thanks i am not putting my hard earned dollars into chinese owned competition my pico 4 is coming tomorrow i will try it with wire and then try to swap to wifi then perhaps i shall buy a dedicated router anyhow i am happy to join vr playerbase n o genuinly that ipd motor is far better than doing manually it is usefull there is a split audio and charger adapter not compatible with quest games period so if i install virtual desktop i could play all the quest games on the pico 4 headset i just ordered these for myself i am interested using the built in games and steam vr thank you for the review video great review do i need a specialized link cable or any usb c to usb cable will do it seems quest uses the same type of cable also would a quest cable work then thanks really pico 4 is just trash bro how is this not the same os as oculus am i tripping how much does virtual desktop cos aud im pretty sure that you had a yellow dot because when you expose your lenses to the suns it basicly kills the pixels how did you record a dead pixel is this headset able to work as a monitor as in could you plug it into your computer and watch or play something like cyberpunk zkxdokd owned by the chinese communist party that is all i needed to know thanks not gonna lie this headset in my opinion is head on against the quest 2 and if improved will 100percent be better i have owned both headsets before and i prefer the pico 4 a lot more than the quest 2 at this point it is just the better choice it would be nice to see developer port the quest 2 firmware to pico 4 a great alternative of spending all of your money on one thing ps vr 2 thank you man very positive and informative thank you dear were you paid to leave this review pico from fnf so how about a more recent video 6 months in which is the better one terrible headset i much preferred the quest 2 on the pico 4 it looked like the image compression was higher via link cable could see thousands of black dots in game around 3 4 meters away the mic either picked up everything or nothing at all vrc also i could see light on the outside reflecting of both lens edges and the controllers were not as comfy to hold my middle fingers did not line up with the side trigger iv just sent mine back spend the extra for the q2 forget handbreak steam vr what is about performance pusher open xr quest2 2 0 does anyone notice this looks like the ready player one vr headset is it better the then the quest or is it the best vr would really love to see an update video on this headset to see if they fixed most of your problems with it my nick name is pico i am so surprised to see this i am real it is funny to think how much money meta lost raising the price of the quest 2 i need to crack down on my unnecessary spending so i can save up for a vr hedset right now the pico 4 is at the top of my list but by christmas i might spot something different that is still under dollar1 000 question can one buy this but not let tiktok collect your information seeing its owned by bydance ccp spy company can it be used off there grid with there spy collections softer ware and that is what i call a beautiful design thanks for the review ten hag ggmu advanced beat saber players beware considering the pico4 for playing everything expert on beat saber tldr forget it long version if you use the pico streaming assistant either over wifi or over usbc and you crank up the video settings to the max the image quality is still inferior to a valve index because it is blurry lower the settings and it becomes more blurry no matter how it is blurry despite the pancake lenses personally i prefer a crisp image with slight screen door effect as on the index than a blurry image without some say the pico streamer app is compressing the video too much who knows whatever the limitation is it sucks so if you want better image quality than with the default streamer app you will need to use virtual desktop virtual desktop consists of 2 parts an app on the pico and a streamer app on your pc but there is a but virtual desktop is streamer app wants to go over wifi only there used to be workarounds involving tethering over usb but after the last firmware update they do not work anymore the workaround involved installing an android app apk which allowed you to access all of the pico is hidden settings besides it was a gigantic pain in the butt to set up tons of forums to read on reddit hard to get right on the first try and you had to enable the settings on the pico and on your pc every time before playing uggh if with your previous headset you used to just start vr and play this is in and of itself is already a deal breaker but now for the major deal breaker the controllers omg these controllers are so bad for playing beat saber it is worse if you have big hands their shape makes it impossible to find a comfortable and secure grip you end up clicking buttons all the time while playing and you know what that does the plastic is super slippery when playing fast they will slip out of your hands absolutely guaranteed do not even think of playing any camellia map when you see youtubers play beat saber with them they all play very slowly clearly these controllers are meant for very casual gaming the tracking and accuracy was also not great during fast play it works but it will ruin your pp for the rest i found the face mask to be very uncomfortable compared to a valve index but i guess ymmv and you could buy aftermarket pads that maybe feel better and do not let light in from the sides i returned my pico4 after less than a week of daily use the poor image quality due to the streaming limitations and the slippery un ergonomic inaccurate controllers made me do so what games can you not play on the pico that you can on the quest its like meta quest pro pico 4 is gt gt gt gt gt gt gt psvr just for that middle finger so its a quest 2 but worse 14 27 interesting subliminal message should i get quest 2 or pico 4 is the pico 4 able to run adobe medium one of the reasons sony apparently went with fresnel on psvr2 was the amount of light it could passthrough vs pancake lenses wanting hdr is why they went with fresnel they claimed headset like momentum 4 can do around 60 hours of playing music now i know a vr headset would be more power hungry but i bet the battery can be improved to at least 10 15 hours 2 3 is too little in my opinion your dog is so cute i play sim racing games and microsoft flight simulator would the pico 4 be suitable i have quest 2 and watching this shit the pico 4 is a total game changer i bet you do not have to have a fb account to get it to work what is the point of making the ui almost identical to the quest but can we sign in with a meta facebook account bro stop being so annoying you are way too cheery and smiley and moving too much its annoying as hell look i do not know at linus and gamers nexus they can be watched for hours the hyper cheer is annoying as hell and looks fake can we login using a single account on multiple devices simultaneously or do we need to create different accounts for each device the pico 4 microphone sounds so good you got a thumbs up from me just for double flipping the bird during the hand tracking demonstration screw meta can you increase the storage just read the negative reviews people lol these youtube guys are getting paid to say good things about this garbage hi i am new to your channel and i just want to say it is great to have a channel like this you do such a great job on reviews and i just want to ask you a question as far as today is right now which do you think is the best headset right now in 2023 13 20 thats so retarded lol why no headphone jack geekvr has a nice face cover makes the pico 4 look even smaller by competition you mean it smashes it right the quest 3 will basically be this hey i have a littel problem with my pico 4 the pov of my pico dous not look like the one he shows insted mine is pixelated maybe it is quest killer but first it is quest copy why are they not selling this in the us did pico ever give a statement on that my pc is connected to the internet via lan is it possible to use virtual desktop with a router while being connected to the internet via lan creator of tiktok ok i will pass can you use pico 4 with gt7 its a good entry point but as soon as someone says i need to have an account for a physical device its a no go for me why are people not putting headphone jacks on their devices first the reverb g1 and g2 and now the pico 4 i can not wait to be able to use one of these vrs to watch porn videos perhaps with a sucker included to act as a vagina or oral cavity who knows how many males will also try the gay version while we are at it  in my opinion the biggest flaws the pico 4 has are that the handtracking doesnt really work for me at least and the game library isnt great so far there are even some games that entirely just do not work like ruinsmagus also it just feels like sometimes the games get really pixelated and low res but on the other hand i got nothing to compare as this is my first vr headset is hitman vr in epic games launcher compatible with the pico 4 frackin ell mike you have come a long way in a short time your vids are unreal great review mate keep up the good work thank you how does the recline mode works does it allow me to play vr while laying down in bed i am arrives 2morrow i will let u s soon damn tiktok is now making vr headsets really thx man fir this 2 comparison i greatly enjoy it 10 20 when you showcased the displays your lights where straight into the lenses man that software is a 1 1 copy of the meta software lol dollar769 00 awh it is owned by bytedance instant killer for me i hate your videos for having so much long adds screw them disembodied hands so immersion breaking i am really glad to know there is an alternative for quest 2 and better visual experience more than rest thanks for review buddy i wouldnt buy this its another tech giant from communist china to gain all your personal info 10 52 can you do this test between the pro and pico 4 i just want an upgrade for immersed and i would go with the pico 4 since it does not have the audio jack i do have the baseus usb type c to audio jack and type c port adapter it will not work on my samsung phone so it was such a waste but will it work for pico 4 im geting a power link kabel compo from amazon 2 25 already they did something better than quest everyone here because they got one for christmas maybe no if they are the same company that owns tik tok then they are going to have creative ways to steal your info and record you i am aware that facebook does that stuff too but there are easy ways to solve those problems on the quest did we ever hear back from pico about that dead pixel i am interested to see how their customer service dealt with your issue i have a quest 2 and the only thing that would keep me from buying the pico 4 is the lack of a headphone jack thanks for the review is the screen door effect still there one is manufacturing and other is during sale 10 15 or 15 10 or 15 15 bought a pico 4 today it seems ok but kind of baffled that it did not feel that different from the old first version of oculus except that the text in the sweetspot was way sharper could also be that in the headsett it just don t actually use the higher res but the other thing is that it felt like i was looking through a binocular is the screens to far away or is it just the way it is don t remember it being like that in oculus menaing that i notice the corners i do know that pico is round to the sides and not the others that i am aware of though i do like that the sweet spot is overall bigger making it a bit easier with headaches and such i can not even consider an alternative unless there is the ability to work virtually like i can on the quest with horizon workroom and immersedvr might finally upgrade from my oculus rift hope my router can keep up with the streaming bandwidth though def happy that it has better fov than quest 2 while also being easier to read text i always feel like things being blurry from afar and the tunnel vision being the two most discomforting things in vr still wish in the future that they will somehow be able to pack even more fov into these things without sacrificing on sizwe though human eyes do have around 180 fov when looking around so it is a shame that currently we can only get just above half of that but does not virtual desktop destroy some of the 3d sensation i e is not it more like playing on a flat screen i need helo should i buy the quest 2 or pico for i do not know now bc at first i wanted to buy the quest 2 now idk good review thanks i was looking for an alternative to meta quest as i do not want to have a meta facebook account which i will be forced to have from january 2023 when meta will effectively brick my quest does the pico have a browser the build quality looks so much better than quest 2 can you play gorilla tag finally replacing my oculus quest 1 no one talks about how horrible the lenses are on pico 4 is the ghosting on these things is horrible and also the screen door effect is awful the battery life is horrendous totally not an upgrade more like a sidegrade do not buy if you have a quest 2 you will not be satisfied with the upgrade the software looks exactly like quest i am going to wait until summer before deciding on what next headset to buy i am eager to get away from oculus but i would like to keep my existing pcvr game library on there i was planning on the quest3 because i imagine it will be much more affordable than the pro but if the pico 4 is a solid competitor then i might just settle for it we will see what meta has to offer if they have anything to offer by summertime otherwise it is likely going to be the pico4 and for my existing oculus library i will just be running revive i guess any wireless vr can beat the quest 2 especially the pico 4 when tiktok does better than meta themselves pico 4 has extra tracking devices to track all body parts can you play any game 00 18 what is the thing on the glass and where can i get it hi thanks for the review i do not have a pc but a chromebook is there a way to get the pico up to date how about netflix is there an app for netflix is it the same or better than oculus i have to be honest i am not a gamer i only use vr headsets to watch movies on big screen are youtube and prime also available the headset may be great on paper or if you get a unit that is not faulty i received a unit with heavy lens distortion there is more and more threads on discord and reddit showing up on this issue it seems that pico released batches to market with faulty lenses in my case this caused severe nausea had to return i just do not think it is worth it it is basically a copy of the oculus especially the software compare it side by side oculus may even be able to sue it is insane i play a lot of il 2 sturmovik vr and i want to buy a new vr headset as my current set rift s is too low res to spot or id planes from any distance would you recommend the pico for this or is there another headset that would be better that isnt too expensive what a lovely little dog what a star videos are always better with a dog my quest is really messed up so this will be a good buy for me 4 32 rest assured that in the headset it runs at a ismooth 72fps tfw motion sickness 13 44 i can not even tell a difference if i did not buy the index a few days ago i would have gotten this biggest issue for me is the game library and software and also there are not accessories to fix that headset that does not have the top part which would be uncomfortable it is a hard pass for me so with using the pico 4 with the virtual desktop i have got a gtx 1070 8gb which isnt exactly bad but i am wondering whether it then fully depends on your pc hardware or only vr or both because i do not want to lack in the graphical department because of the 1070 any help would be appreciated newbie here d may i know if this works with fallout 4 vr in stereo mode or does it work in stereo with normal fallout 4 asking cos of the controllers vs mouse keyboard thanks have you tried turning the brightness down i know is counter intuitive but apparently it controls the white balance more than actual brightness that would be more a gamma the colours should improve also like this seems like this is not available in the states the fact the tik tok guys made this is such a heart breaking deal breaker fuck genuinely had interest in it dude now we have another portable vr console where games need to be specifically ported to this nonsense is getting out of hand the market is totally split i am ignoring all this and waiting for standalone headsets like valve is deckard that will hopefully be open platform and out of the box compatible with pc vr games closed systems can buzz off with these the vr market is not going to get anywhere half life on epic games store do not you mean full life nope myopia does it run vrchat thank you for letting me know the chinese company bytedance made the pico 4 i was considering buying this until that point gt not including the world is global default currency the us dollar when quoting prices gt 609k subscribers way to do global outreach einstein facebook is bad but idk how i feel about a chinese headset that copies the entire ui of the quest how do you know optimal ipd 14 25 he has no rules no boundary is he does not flinch at torture human trafficking or genocide could anyone help me with how to connect it with a link cable for the pc the thing is i want this i do not have a pc and i do not know if theres gorilla tag are the controllers safe from drifting since i heard alot of people on quest 2 getting drift after a few months its a chinese rip off of the quest 2 and china loves watching in you people and peoples private infomation no bluetooth latency with sennheiser headphones im still waiting for christmas pickle 4 chinese spyware tech what is the price hi do you know if kodi can be accessed somehow or can it do everything through virtual pc desktop please that it works on pc oculus titles with virtual desktop is absolutely amazing i am enjoying the pay for games as tax free games for the pico4 here in the us atm anyone else have the pico4 here in the us i am very tempted with the pico 4 after watching this review i currently use a quest 2 but only for flight sims via pcvr the problem is my ipd is somewhere around 75mm and the quest 2 is only just useable for me there is always some blurring in one or both eyes which gets very tiring over a long period i tried an hp reverb but that was even worse wonder if there is anywhere i can try a pico 4 before parting with my money 2160x2160 is not actually 4k in pixels it is nominally more than 1440p true 4k in a 1 1 square aspect ratio would be 2880x2880 misleading aite ill ask the real question is this better with adult contents than the quest 2 thanks for your hardwork for this review well knowledge and very go deep in all the details which one would you choose quest 2 or pico 4 as a pc vr hooked up through virtual desktop a dead pixel that is not cool i think i will wait for q3 2hrs isnt great but bobo are i wish you were my dad the double tap pass trough has been part of the quest 2 for a long time i am surprised that you were surprised by it on the pico good video i was looking for an alternative to quest as i do not trust facebook with my data i was on board until you said it was made by the creators of tik tok as they do not have great privacy practices either thank you for letting me know before i got one i like your voice this looks like 1x1 clone pico will never be like quest lightleak push some foam between facecover and headstrap or pull a hoodie over head and set improves sound too anyway to get this in canada to be honest this is just gonna run down oculus or no one will get it because people already have quest2 can not be a quest 2 killer not as long as the pico headsets can not be had in the us not on amazon not at bestbuy thing feels like vaporware in north america can not kill quest but i would love a self contained package with class leading display and controllers for wireless play having onboard gaming is a plus but not mandatory in my mind will the pico 4 be available in the us eventualy should really start with not available in usa hi are you aware of the wrong headtracking on the pico 4 does your review unit have it no reviewer i watched has mentioned it so far anyone know if it is possible to use a usb c split for audio jack and charging at the same time how fucked up are humans playing voilent games where they teach their brain to kill its time mother nature gets rid of this species pardon no beat saber no deal 0 36 thats what i had alot of looking forward to hearing your impressions on the quest pro and would also really like to see a meta connect recap vid i may buy a screw or a bucket china but electronics nope smart tech nope tiktok influenced nope i would rather have mark n his wolves watching me than the whole chinese corrupt gov dictatorship it is bad enough already living in trudeaus chinada no offence to the good people of china maybe this is headset i might go with can not stand with fb meta hate that company who else got a pico 4 ad while watching small game library pass i will upgrade with a quest3 will visionkeys and magic keys app work on this headset piano tutorial app i can not work out what is only good for the quest i do not want a quest what is better ayyyyy 8 00 bro no one is gonna buy that it is so expensive i feel the pico would be an alternative if it was released where everyone could get one but since the release leaves out the us which is a big market for vr i have had people tell me that they will import it but pico said if you try to access their pico home and store on the headset it will not work so unfortunately i can not see it as an alternative to any quest products i will wait for the quest 3 announced to be released next year when are you getting the quest pro am i on something or does the pico look like the headset from ready player one what about privacy concerns reviewers seems to not dive as deep into this topic with chinese vr headsets as they do with metas vr headsets any ideas why so for virtual desktop i can use my keyboard and mouse available in uk europe and asia somebody tell this guy that brexit did not cause britain to float away to the middle of the atlantoc xd yes away from facebook hey mike do you think you will get your hands on the quest pro controllers it would be interesting to hear how they work with quest 2 how is that an alternative price is around 300 to 500 wasnt that the price of the quest one do you get paid the q2 lenses are atrocious wish pico had more to offer for a valid jump gonna wait for q3 i guess does it have face tracking and can the controller work behind you is boneworks on there or is it just oculus games man i have a question maybe do you know how to be a tester i want to be a vr and vr game tester to test alpha and beta verions it looks crazy high quality for the pricing mehemmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm heh haha best vr headset on the market fr ong ong do you need a computer for the pico 4 because i have a crap one i wonder how can you screen recording the dead pixel that is physical on the headset hello sir i will be polite may i ask you what accessories do you use on your quest 2 and what your pc parameters are and one last question how do you do that the vr graphics look so wickedly good have a nice day whats the best cheap vr headset for pc gaming i would say this is a great alternative to the quest if you have ethical concerns over meta but swapping zuckerberg for xi jinping is not what i would call an upgrade xd can i order these online if i live in california 14 26 thats an immediate weird decision to not include an headphone jack everything was pretty persuasive until that point waiting on mine got the 256gb model for 363 mainly because the base model went out of stock i mainly play pcvr games on my quest 2 so should i sell off my quest 2 and get pico 4 instead i am looking to buy my first ever vr headset between the quest 2 and pico 4 which one should i get i do not care much for gaming i will be mostly using it for watching movies from my pc and enjoying the vr experience google earth and such i was going to get this but since tiktok made it then f it what is with these companies not having back hand straps like the knuckles like really no one wants the straps that go on your wrist so how much you want to bet the pico 4 is just a ripped off quest 2 can you buy it now or not yet i am so excited for the ccp to consolidate more power over western audiences does it work with echo vr a nice tool for the ccp to keep tracking stupid americans oh shucks i beat saber that is the only title that pulls my psvr out of the drawer and all for the low low price of handing over all your data to the ccp and having a device connected to the internet with cameras and microphones all over it you would have to be a literal moron to think this is ok pico spam is actually fucking annoying wow would really get pico over meta hands down watching this review is touching my vr heart in my opinion the vr industry is dead at the moment i loved vr when i got it and for years after i had a pimax 5k super and valve knuckles with full body and everything then no games were coming out no new tech was being made completely stagnant for years this is a quest 2 made by another company yet another stagnant innovation in a seemingly sleeping industry how is the games prices i was literally seconds away from buying this and then you mentioned it does not have a headphone jack i need a headphone jack because i live in a noise sensitive environment tik tok is worse than meta i will pass just stick to the quest 2 in terms of budget everyone has a facebook account already it is probably a lot easier to set up i personally do not like the controllers and having weight on the headset makes it more stable which shifts less when using it didnt take long to run out of stock on amazon for uk idk why i read the title as food review 4 if you do not have a good pc and a link cable do not get the pico no point chinesse spyware what should i buy a pico or a quest knowing that i own a powerfull pc and i have a very good wifi for a first vr headset drinks coffe and call it tea nice device but a hard pass for me due to ties with a certain asian government such a shame i would get it if it was available in the us made by tik tok instant no buy from me damnit can not we have anything normal hand tracking bit today we are going to take a look at the chinese communist party is headset a headset designed to steal all your data hi can you run oculus exclusive titles via pcvr when i try and run loan echo in the pico 4 i get an error steam title run great on virtual desktop try getting a double adapter that has headphone jack and a usb port looks great i like how the headset is smaller has full color passthrough for the same price as quest 2 but the software looks like they copied the ui of quest 2 to the dot i wish they could send those to the us for us to try it look this vr the pico 4 someone has to fina a way to put custom games like lightsaber and other meta owned games cuz i caant do a vr play session without those games honestly or meta has to make a contract with pico i guess someone please find the way i do not know what oasis does to do it but he makes me feel excited and way more immersed when he does reviews almost as if i was there pico 4 is cool but quest pro is better i have the quest 2 and am not going to get another headset because tbh the games are pretty trash right now and the quest 2 is super uncomfortable but i can see why this new one might be better but just seems like a waste of money to buy this one too specially when there arnt a lot of changes and even the quest 2 pro is a complete waste of money and does not really change at all the only one calling my name is the psvr 2 that is gonna be a change after being round the block selling my soul this remains my go to channel for vr news ctrl c ctrl v this headset is very cool however you can just tell that they took so much from the quest does it support big screen i mean what about movie watching not even considering any standalone headsets if they do not support alvr maybe they will port it over soon i own an oculus rift while quest 2 seemed interesting trying the headset i found it to be way heavy and i am not sure i am all sold on it pico seems like a a good option mostly because i only play pc vr but i am unsure if i should invest in it is it worth upgrading from oculus rift to a pico also i wish more vr makers could make controllers like valve index should you upgrade from quest 2 to pico 4 so it does have capacitive sensors inside the controllers never seen that mentioned in other reviews will it ever come to the states i have a question will this vr headset be good for bone works or any games like that like example half life alex it is october 22 and i am pretty sure like it is already sold out shame they gave up on the displayport that wouldve really set it apart from the quest 2 but i guess the extra production cost versus the amount of people you have access to a powerful enough pc was just not worth it in their eyes i guess current gpus are now powerful enough where the compression isnt that noticeable unlike back in 2016 when it was necessary considering the 1060 being what was available at the time i feel like i wasted my money on the oculus quest 2 i wan t to get a vr headset should i get a quest 2 or the pico 4 if you could please not jam the headphone plug into that usb port that would be wonderful thanks am buying both for the hell of it owned by tiktok i am immediately out facebook is trash tiktok is an actual dumpster fire best saber suck i got really excited thinking the controllers had finger tracking like the index sadge pico 4 for pcvr quest 2 for standalone amp pcvr as someone with neither i do not know how important standalone will be to me so it is really not clear what i should get lol plus i miss out on being able to play re4vr and other quest exclusives good deal if you want china harvesting all ur data fuck the ccp and anything that they use to steal our data just received my pico 4 and it is night and day difference for me from quest 2 however i can totally understand why some people may not feel as big a difference for me the sweet spot area in quest 2 is lenses is so small that it is almost unusable i actually ended up digging out my rift s again pico 4 is sweet spot is vastly bigger it is still not the entire field of view but not nearly as disruptive as in quest 2 therefore if you have also suffered from the tiny center clear area of quest 2 you will find pico 4 being miles better but if you have not had any problem with quest 2 in the first place you might not be as blown away i still do not understand why they thought it was a good idea to region lock them like at least give the option to unlock it when buying one from china giving my info to ccp vs lizardman i would choose ccp i do not want to own either headset from facebook or china both are just spyware peices of junk of course saying all that people will just consider a conspiracy theorists or something i need your opion on this i currently have a quest 1 for pcvr and i am going to get a new headset should i just stick with a quest 2 because i already have some standalone games on it or should i look at getting a pico 4 i need to know by the end of the month so anyone give me some advice please i really like the look of the pico 4 but i just do not want to buy all of my games software again if only there was some kind of cross platform option awesome detailed review as always i was waiting to see details of the pico 4 pro trying to decide if and when to upgrade from quest 2 with it only for enterprise outside china the pico 4 is an appealing option may wait and see what happens with the software updates and pico store great to see more options coming including psvr2 competition is great but it does make it hard to know where to spend my dollardollar also caution with committing too much to one platform excited to see what comes from sidequests backing from google this has the potential to make switching platforms easier and not losing your library could google play become the vr game store of choice im actually thinking of switching my quest 2 for my pcvr use quest 2 forever boiz nice review i ordered my pico 4 set today and it is expected delivered on wednesday i live in norway and seems no delivery problems here at least not what i heard this headset is literal garbage right now though because of its game library there is literally no reason to buy something that doesnt have any good games to play would never support tik tok binance they are part of this county going to shambles so therefore i would rather have the quest 2 when i save up i am buying to upgrade from my quest 1 i just want that shiny box it comes in if these come to the us i would consider one to replace my rift s thank you tea tea coffee 4 life kind of crazy how similar it is to the quest 2 even the system menus looks like the quest i guess that is a good thing though if you are the kind of person that wants a quest 2 just without the facebook nonsense pico 4 pinnochio 4 pico obviously copied the quest 2 they re stooopid to have brought it out it s non innovative i ll only upgrade my quest2 in 2 years from now or if apple comes out with their version of vr ar why would anyone in their right minds upgrade to a pico 4 i meant pinnocchio 4 got my pico 4 yesterday and left eye have 1 dead pixel in center lol sometimes i see it rare but it is what it is hi mike i am a new subscriber i know absolutely nothing about gaming i had no interest in gaming but after just turning 60 i have been discouraged by my physical health which has kept me from travel as i want too so i decided for now to travel in vr you are the 1st video i came upon in looking for a headset so the other day i went and bought a quest 2 and the head and face thingy is you use on yours i have also gotten very interested in games by watching your videos thank you for all the great information on all these amazing products this advanced card maker lol is moving into a new world and it is all your fault your channel is amazing wait wait the pico recording is native 16 9 with a decent fov idk the pico 4 seems better than the quest 2 now but how is it gonna hold up when the quest 3 comes out if this headset could connect with displayport i would have bought it but compressed makes it not worth switching out my reverb so as a replacement for the rift s its good i am looking forward to cutting the wire with the bonus of getting to keep my oculus library via virtual desktop yeet yeet ah yes chinese spyware you lost me at owned by same company as tiktok so it is just a chinese version of the quest 2 got it china 0 chance china is not weaponizing this as a spy tool zero i m coming from quest 1 it will be a generational leap forward can t wait for it to arrive x man i kinda wanna consider getting this over the quest 2 how much does it cost though this guy reminds me of dantdm i have a question can u play roblox on pick 4 1 56 my ocd kicks in i wanna remove that hair i think i just wasted my money child as a young one by buying the quest 2 is this true the really dropped the ball without dp on this one so sad bytedance fuck that this is a ccp spy tool hard pass see they released a headset but now you already bought a bunch of games on the quest 2 so youre not gonna switch anyway look ik that people are saying pico is better but keep in mind quest 2 came out 3 years ago remember pico has flaws that quest does not i thought this was bill burr scalpers will destroy all consumer products for some products to be successful like game consoles and vr headsets you need as much of them possible in the hands of actual consumers example the new pico 4 vr headset to have developers create content for it it has to be in the hands of as many people as possible with every single one scalped the sh t out of there is not a single one on the market eventhough the original price of a 256 gig version is 500 bucks amazon is scalp devision sells them at 900 bucks and are already sold out permanently making the future of it as bleak as the ps5 in one generation of scalping game consoles are dead vr will go the same way in the end we will have nothing left we are witnessing the end of popular consumer products the only way to stop this is sell one per verified person at the normal retail price companies are to shortsighted to see how just selling everything to scalpers will kill their own products in the future it is sickening i really wanted to buy a ps5 but gave up on that years ago i am not paying a scalper anything i hope they get stuck with tons of unsold sh t and die in a fire nobody should pay these a les a single penny i will probably never get my hands on a pico 4 vr either and have to exept my dated quest 2 will be the last standalone vr i will ever own and with no playerbase any software sales depended products are dead on arrival the solution is simple and starts at the companies that manufacture them stop selling in bulk to non consumers ffs having aspherical lenses is a huge plus imo it should greatly improve the sweet spot in addition the fresnel type lenses always seem to give me a headache they cause tons of visible distortion i hope we see more headsets going to smooth glass lenses i do not like because controller using aa battery i want rechargeable battery like the controller of sony and xbox i am looking for a device which has a better resolution and fov than q2 to play dcs without breaking my bank account this may be the one 1 16 lcd displays ist saying display twice the only question i have is why on earth would you use a grenade to open a door and then waste another one on a single zombie are you made of grenades that was a great thorough review mike thank you same company as tiktok gross get this trash our of here from a trash company beat saber isn t on it so hard pass these chinese dudes are so op i am going nowhere near this just for the fact that this company has already been caught access american user data i do not want to give the chinese government access to inside my house facebook is bad enough it is bad the head strap is not removable and it is not a snug enough fit it is unusable laying down it is actually not the display less bright it is the pancake lenses that make the image more dim thanks very good review i got my pico 4 about 48 hours ago and yesterday there were many more games than day before in the store so the content issue might be outdated soon and i love it very comfortable for my head and the pcvr streaming is awesome rtx 3080 with 1000 mbit router so much better than my f ing vive cosmos with a cable just not great for sim racing since those games in vr brings down every system without 4090 to it is knees already without streaming but it was playable and the input lag probably similar or even less than with v sync on a pancake but no problem with hl alyx and finally a great experience in this game its nice to compare quest 2 release 13 10 2020 vs pico 4 release 15 10 2022 and say that its almost the same parameters xd i have the pico myself and just wanted to say i think the tracking isnt great with movement i noticed when i opened the pico menu or library the screen is slightly moving and doesnt feel as stable as on the quest 2 lets hope it wil get fixed in some update but its really weird noone has noticed this i believe that pico is on the right track just ironing out the bumps but with a little help from the community and devs i think that this will be a vr headset that will push the boundaries of vr call me dumb but i see a bright future for them well done to pico amp great video mate just sad that im broke i would loved to used this pico 4 power adapter how mich w freality not the same anymore hope you return in the near future must be nice to be able to afford an oculus anyway love the content keep it up bro i do not trust chinese companiese or companiese related to chinese fund so i will not buy this however competition is good thing for consumers whatsoever nice review as always hey there i mainly would play steam vr games and only had a quest 2 for a month some time would you recommend the pico 4 for me or would you recommend me to wait for a 4 pro if you were to use vr with link cable to pc so you can run wired steam games wou not the audio come out of your pc does this mean you can use wireless 2 4 headphones with dongle example steelseries 7 or higher to have much lower latency basically a pancake quest in more ways than one flater overall headset and flat lenses after all that shady stuff byte dance did also with the upcoming eye tracking do not believe i could trust this maker i am confused the internet connection is that so you can play games directly from the pico 4 website without a pc or is that for down loading soft wear this is a great review for someone trying to decide between a pico 4 and quest 2 for their first vr headset virtual desktop makes the investment worth it as it gets around the lack of pico store apps by letting you use those from the quest store as for there being no audio jack i would recommend the ad adtrip usb c splitter it is slightly long but very affordable and better than the 2 port adapters available the larger sweet spot fov and this resolution is really tempting over the q2 their next headset should be amazing they have earned their place slippery and extremely undermining road for vr in general this approach that this us meta are using by banning the best standalone vr titles from other stand alone devices it will create tensions like we also see on xbox and playstation with certain people using an extremely black amp white perspective depending on which fraction your into bed with why not let as many people as posiible be able to enjoy good content and do not have to purchase another expensive vr headset just to play certain titles that could easily be played on a product they alreayd have with the exact same soc and android based os not to mention the e waste but its us meta facebook common logic and simply having an eye on the biggger picture and the greater good for the masses useally do not take center there i do not have a vr headset but not a fan of that rancid meta approach comfort and light leakage was my biggest issue with it too having a big nose i also found it dug into my nose too i would definitely consider buying again i returned it if there is a decent 3rd party facial interface but i suspect it could be quite a wait as most 3rd party companies are probably going to wait and see how it sells first sounds a bit familiar i see that little atf juggy in there wicked review no 3 5 mm jack is instant nope bought this absolutely awful lets light in from the sides so you can see the room in the lenses downloaded one game war planes which i played on the quest 2 writing was blurry controls way too sensitive tried to watch amazon prime movies just a blank screen with sound most disappointing was the environment very basic even typing on the virtual keyboard was awful if you wanted to use special characters like or dollar compared to the quest 2 it was night and day the quest 2 is like a smart phone the pico 4 is like a nokia 5190 for those of us who are old enough to remember them it was so dreadful i have sold it after a day only problem for me is lack of gamez great review i only heard about pico recently i have looked into index htc etc and have a quest2 but i needed to know something on this one covered all the bases love your work is there a way to buy and play lone echo 2 on pico 4 good review i will stick with the three quest 2 is we use in my house mine and my 2 daughters video definitely deserved a like my pico 4 arrived today setting everything up reminded me of when i did the same routine with the quest 2 in 2020 only this time i was not struggling to find the sweet spot constantly adjusting the headset avoiding scratching the lenses with my glasses suffering the face plate pressed against my face determined to really enjoy this new vr experience i bought the q2 mainly to watch tv and films on a huge screen with total immersion i never got that faceplate after face plate strap after strap counter weight after counter weight little did i know that my stubbornness would last over 18 months until i gave up on it it will soon be on ebay and good riddance to it now having learned with the q2 i was wary of the p4 but right out of the box i felt that same childlike eagerness to use it as i felt with the quest but this time i was not disappointed it is so much better than the q2 so much lighter and the sweet spot is huge yes the faceplate is a little rough but it is not clamped to my face as the quest was and wearing glasses is easy peezy the longest i wore the q2 was 40 minutes and most of that time was spent adjusting the headset i lost track of time with the p4 tonight you know it is there but it is not dominating your time in vr i know i can never have those two years back but with this unit i will certainly try to make up for that lost time my pico 4 arrived yesterday thankfully it took a while to get it comfy but then i did not suffer the same issues as mike i have had a 0g quest and usually rock a reverb g2 but wanted some cable free action not as visually impressive as the g2 but everything else ticks the right boxes and it is not meta woot right now virtual desktop is a must have though the pico option is not up to the task at time of writing yes the is back so in a few words not worth an upgrade argh no audio jack everyone keeps making the same booby but most will use the built in speakers i guess i can not remember the amount of times i regret buying a phone with no headphone jack after losing all those usb c to 3 5 adaptors it does look really good though me wants an actual balanced review of the pico 4 i have seen some other channels discuss it and suggest should i upgrade to the pico 4 from the quest 2 with the implication that its clearly better all around my initial thoughts were it doesnt make sense for me to switch horses for such a modest gain especially with the cost ive sunk into stand alone games and it seems to kind of bare out as true i guess it is nice to have another device out there though even if it isnt the right choice for me currently thanks for the review software looks just like quests damn kind of wish i got a pico instead of the quest 2 my main gripe being the ipd i batter to get that sweet spot as its in between the 3 shitty click settings i own a quest 1 and i was thinking about the quest pro however that was back when we still thought it would be around 800 usd i might pick up the pico 4 pro since it will have all the fancy stuff and the software will be more mature how much is it in money no gbp i would consider this a clear upgrade if the new quest pro controllers did not exist anything that uses led strips just seems primitive by comparison nice honest review pico 4 is a fantastic standalone headset for me i am very much into pcvr and while this seems to give a good experience i already own a g2 and the through the lens footage on the internet is showing the g2 significan notly better if i were to buy a standalone headset i would probably get the quest pro over the pico 4 as the mixed reality experience really fascinates me i am not sure but why could not pico have provided 2 colour passthrough cameras for a 3d stereoscopic display i have never had a vr headset but i can afford either a quest 2 or a poco 4 i want to primarily game so which one do you recommend thanks for the honest review everyone else seems to be over hyping the image quality nice to hear that it is about on par with quest 2 i will stick to my aero would it be a good idea to buy pico 4 when you already have a quest 2 i do not want to support a bytedance ccp headset did not know it was owned by the tik token company can we get an affordable vr that does not have people constantly gathering our info ffs lol is not tik tok in trouble for gathering face data and now they are getting this directly on your face my ipd is not quite symmetrical i wonder how much of a difference it would make to be able to move each lens independently relative to the nose of my bridge the only question i have is does it come black i am only half serious but i really do hate white hardware it gets dirty way too quick and i am not the kind of person that constantly wipes everything down every time i use it 13 23 mrtv show some adapter 3 5mm and type c in one device so there are solution already you take your tea the same as i do hey mike your videos are so nicely done hi to your puppy and family in 10 years time we will realize we have been wearing vr contact lenses for the past 2000 years but we just forgot to take them off super disappointed there is not a headphone jack that is the one thing i needed 8 40 the same problem i had with pico neo 3 link i sold it already and ordered pico 4 but you are the 1st reviewer who said about this problem well it is a quest killer for me as i will sell my quest 2 for only one reason the quest is very uncomfortable to wear so i rarely use it i even play much more with the old psvr 1 the pico is my new pcvr headset and the coming psvr 2 will be my main headset for gaming being comfortable for longer than just a few minutes is very important for me i have quite a huge head maybe the quest is more acceptable if you have a smaller head do not know i just had to send back my quest 2 because the controller drifted and i am planning on buying these so how is the quality the dead pixel scares me and my glasses are big and had problems to use them in quest 2 space inside in pico is better looking to finally get into vr so what is the current generation beyond those from last year i plan to buy late this year or 2023 so i am wondering if i should wait or who is the front runner or best bang for the buck in the us i have just got a rift s still is this headset much of an improvement over that i do not really play games on these only would use for vr simulation and racing flying sims love the competition i am hoping wifi 6e in newer headsets will improve wireless pcvr streaming lightweight wireless vr is the dream for quality 2 37 the exact moment that my dreams of having a great vr headset without the downsides of the quest 2 were shattered you can still order it for amazon here in the states it just will take longer to get here with that headset it seems like it has all the same problems that the quest to have when it first launched so once we start getting third party accessories i am sure it will make that headset much more comfortable well there are some new headphones that you can use that were made for virtual reality and their bluetooth which i am sure you already know about not a great alternative when it is own by yet another social media company quote you do not need a tictoc account to use it yeah not yet that is exactly what oculus promised when they were bought out by facebook i have a reddit response from palmer lucky himself promising that if they added a displyport this would have been the vr headset for literally everyone bytedance privacy is my concern i have bought one today its for xmas quest 2 loader is the killer ty for the video if i have some games on the oculus do i need to buy them again for the pico i would like to hear in the review about tests how much data does it transfer to china what data is stored on chinese servers great product no library of top titles so interim pass for sure typical strongly negatively biased review from a vr youtuber who is paid from meta simply ridiculous so i have a q1 would you say that i should rather go for q2 or pico 4 100percent pc vr is going to be a factor for me thank you for the detailed review i think what is cool about the motorised ipd is that if different people use it they can just use their accounts yeah i have a dead pixel on my quest 2 ugh i am getting pico4 in 4 days i hope nice review finally someone notices the similarity with the pico and ready player one lol my only concern is motion sickness as that is what is been putting me off buying any vr headset dang the editing is a great review and as a long time follower and owner of psvr oculus rift oculus go oculus quest and quest 2 i have enjoyed keeping up with vr information i ordered my pico 4 and recieved it yesterday launch day and very impressed with the visuals i have slowly but surely moved to more games via the pc with steam and cross buy of the oculus meta games means many are now available to my pc only a few star wars games limited to quest 2 so i will be keeping this competition is a good thing to have so i really welcome this release also with the headphone adaptor you can find a longer version usb c to headphone with charging upto 60w on amazon if you want to add that option please someone make a non stand alone headset again i do not want to pay for heavier headset with high tech chips i am never gonna use it is made by bytedance why the f would i sell my soul the chinese spy party it is gonna be so cool if sidequest could work on pico devices cheers for not clickbaiting quest 2 killer looks like a great competitor i look forward to seeing what they do to it in the future that being said i will probably stick with my quest 2 as i already have a good library that i would rather not have to repurchase do not forget the pico pro 15 25 ahahahahahahaha fantastic review covered all the things i wanted to learn about the headset thanks is this available in the us i need to know i am getting a vr headset for standalone games not pcvr which headset should i get please help right now i am looking and pico 4 and meta quest 2 please let me know beatsaber will not be coming any time soon lol wait the wired image quality is worse than wireless what is the point of having the wired option then what is it for just for people who like falling over some wires great video thanks because of this excellent review i am binning my quest 2 and getting a pico 4 is it going to acquire titles like bonelab beatsaber stuff like that in the future i still have the oculus rift cv1 and i am looking for an low price alternative to connect to my pc the rift2 is not anvailable in my country and i need alot of space for my glasses or special lenses for the vr system most intern visionadaptation is not enough for me to get a clear picture the large gabs on the side sounds nice for my big head maybe the pico 4 is the one i was looking for but are there anny protectors for the lenses anvailable as i said my glases are special and on oculus rift i tapt the lenses alot with may glasses until i got a pare of bonus lenses in my vision parameters i am scared of scratshing the lenses they literally copied quest 2 is whole system ui it is from china we are not surprised pico will not be getting advanced chip like meta in the future i hate meta but i also hate bytedance gimme a headset that is not backed by a shadowy cabal plz i get motion sick af it is my first vr headset and i am not convinced at all by vr after that first use yesterday the image is really bad blurry when you need to read text or stuff i tried every setting of the lenses it gets close but still shitty maybe my face is just weird will test with the spacer again later maybe that helps but as for now meh better wait 1 2 more yrs quest 2 is way batter how would it look choppy when the video is only at 30fps i like mike but this is yet another mainstream review laden with caveats to appease meta the take home for me is this as a pcvr headset it is superior to the quest 2 it is cheaper it is more enjoyable watching media content on the pico 4 than it is in the quest 2 the controllers are superior in terms of tracking sure you could argue it is not a quest 2 killer but it is definitely not it is equal it is superior the only point i would concede is the software features need some work too many meta ambassadors on yt with one eye on zuck dead pixel on arrival i hope i will be lucky with my unit i enjoyed dead pixels with my pimax and i do not want to experience it again great review get pico 4 or wait for psvr2 sold my quest 2 and do not want to get another one at this point hey vr oasis excellent review have you tried the usb type c 3 5mm adapters that allow pass through charging there are a quite a few adapters on amazon for example is there a way to have your quest 2 library on your pico 4 the original pico neo 3 non link supported the vr usb c port on the 2000 series nvidia cards does this one support that feature know htc vive are teasing a new headset if it is ther same as the pico 4 but with wigig 2 wifi that would make me happy as good pc wireless headset with low latency wigig2 wouldd be nice just unboxed my pico 4 and my first impression was disappointed the face cushion is so stiff it pressed my face much more than the quest 2 i did not feel it light at all it also left ugly marks on my face just after a few minutes of play terrible there was no tracking at all until i set the boundaries it made me feel dizzy the worst bug if i shake my head quickly the whole scene moves with my head like there was no tracking at all this does not happen with the quest 2 very annoying the color pass through is also very bad objects that are 1 5m tall were displayed as flat on the floor the depth sensor is clearly missing without that it is a mess overall the pico 4 is a huge disappointment i think i will cry and will sell it as soon as i can i love watching movies in vr and for me this would be a compelling buy but no headphone jack is a deal breaker i will pass sadly this is the first time i heard someone mention the controllers having capacitive sensors which not having them was a major con for me at first so if this is true i have nothing to worry about in vrchat i own a quest 2 and do not need this at the moment but even if i considered buying it i would not do it it because of the lack of headphone jack it is a big con for me what i think about pico 4 is they must have a better option in anyway than quest 2 if not this headset will not have a competitive value and its not a quest killer but how to survived from quest 2 not killed after they launch and sell their headset thats what my opinion tbh i would feel kinda scammed buying this seems crazy you can not plug headphones in loving your in depth review buddy been a fan for ages this cements you as an honest non biased reviewer respect lee marvin hitchman ladbible shaun attwood neil samworth is real porridge etc how to connect pico 4 to tv lol it reminds me of the vive focus 3 as you said you could not try the fitness app or parties pre release now it is released can you comment on these features did the pass through get any better moving from os 5 0 to 5 2 0 thanks for the great review was really looking forward to seeing this i hope the headset does well and brings more people to vr definitely a competitor at a reasonable price imagine in 12 months when quest 3 releases probably the pico 5 will too if the latter has eye tracking it might be a game changer at least for pc vr users nice one mike can not wait for your arpara review the lack of an audio jack is a deal breaker for me i can not help but think the reviewer was underwhelmed i have ordered one purely because the quest 2 has a single screen whereas the pico 4 has two dedicated screens which is perfect for those of us with a larger ipd this is a big deal but was glossed over here thanks for the review mike and for covering the pcvr section in such detail cheers it may not have beat saber but it does have smash drums with 3 extra songs there is an issue with the lenses surprised you did not mention it more it is fine when gaming but really noticable in the home environments and when the keyboard and menu systems why does the interface look like the quests lol bought my new quest 2 at 349euros sold it last week at 349euros when i saw the pico 4 but i am not buying it now i will wait sometimes to see the evolution but if i needed a vr headset now i would definitely choose the pico 4 for the people who say the quest is better fuck pico you are just mad you bought a quest for the same price or higher these are both good headset but the pancake lenses and the weight distribution would be enough for me to go for the pico the quest 2 is not enjoyable with the original strap and all that weight on the nose althought i do not have a giant nose without the glass spacer i could not use the quest 2 cause of the pain alleluja looks like someone got our back for when meta will inevitably go bankrupt due to all the stupid s they are doing right now d thanks for the in depth and complete review do not apologise for the long video owned by bytedance that is where i turned off the video hi does it work with quest 2 is pirated apps games comfort is a biggie for me cf q2 thank you for honest review the front foam feels very comfortable to me maybe we have differently shaped heads but there is a bit of light leakage on the sides also you can use both link cable and audio jack using hub damn i bought quest 2 a week ago should i sell it or keep it isnt it horrible youd need to repurchase your entire games library absolute deal breaker 128 or 256 something i am struggling with when it comes to vr like quest or peco these companies are not the most trustworthy having data and privacy issues but make such appealing vr products how can pico shamelessly copy entire quest ui to their headset as if that is a ok thing looks like you beat thrill to it damn nice review and thorough review i got myself the pico 4 after testing it at a roadshow its quite abit cheaper in my region compared to the quest 2 and way more comfortable i do have to say in regards to your point about fit vr is a very personal thing and fits different people differently i have a rounder and bigger head so the pico 4 fits me perfectly with zero light leaks whereas the quest 2 was way too snug and pinching the area around my eyes so my advice is always try to find a test unit first to try out the fit before buying can i play gorilla tag on it thanks for honest review mate for sure vrcover and bobovr had cook something of their sleeve for this bad boy my god the shiny black front was sucking the fingerprints right off me just watching the video my vr upgrade had been long overdue and i have been watching the pico with great interest but i think i will be looking around for a decent second hand quest 2 and wait for the psvr 2 for the main course awesome video as always great for some amogus vr it is not an alternative but a better option quest 2 better than pico 4 it is true the meta exclusive games are not the horizon zero dawn type of games so i will not miss one of them i think in the long run the pico store will be superior if the devs can sell in china too i will get the pico 4 today bye bye dusty quest2 hey mike is there a new podcast for you that i can catch you on cool i will wait for the quest 3 thank you oh boy i have been waiting for this video let me just drop the kid off to school and get comfortable samsung where are you looks like a true bootleg finally a real assessment is it worth reselling your quest 2 to pico 4 not sure you know i bought a belt for the waist 3 months ago made in china it only lasted 2 months to break i have never bought something that comes from china and is of good quality we see it here with the deadpixel cheap products cheap parts pay you for what you have for those who ordered a pico 4 from america good luck with warranty and returns still waiting for the pimax crystal owned by tiktok that is enough information a communist company that collects data on users sail is coming soon to pico vr you know i really think this headset seems good but there is one thing the fact that the quest 2 has a replaceable headstrap is so good because mine is battery is pooped and only lasts an hour but now i have a confortable headstrap with hot swappable battery backs and i havent had to worry about charge since i am sure solutions like that will come to the pico 4 but ima keep my quest 2 with infinite battery edit i finished the video and i see that bobovr has already done it but no interchangeable headstrap i live in china so not needing to use a vpn to use this instead of the quest is tempting solid review but i am still considering replacing my quest2 with the pico4 simply because the visual sweetspot is too small on the quest2 and it is too front heavy if i was not so deep into the quest 2 with the shear amount of games i have purchased i would totally have bought this it seems better in terms of hardware in almost every way compared to the quest 2 good evening mike great review video on the pico 4 i deftly looking into getting a headset that can do both pc vr and standalone vr have a good evening mike how is the comfort in quest 2 out of the box its more expensive headset and i hear you have to buy elite strap because its so uncomfortable i hope they release a narcissistic app that lets me dance like an idiot in my living room definitely more competition is welcome although i am a little concerned about how byte dance owns pico i hope privacy is some what at a respectable level and not turn into tiktok and collect and sell user data and provide it to the chinese government sure meta is just as bad but i trust meta with my data more then a chinese company who collects more data from tiktok then every other social media around one of the biggest arguments for the pico is for me the huge sweet spot this should really improve the experience surprised you you did not say anything about not being able to switch head straps since you have a love affair with your bobo strap that is a nice looking headset i still have the first oculus quest but not sure whether to wait chinese communist party vr headset no thanks not a quest 2 killer easy the games ok did not have to watch the whole video bye oh also probably the software but we all forget quest 2 took 2 years to get where it is now i received mine last week and im loving it for once i can buy games in my currency it was way more comfortable than the meta ones and the face cushion wasnt as bad for me and the weight my god so light my only gripe is the controller buttons do not feel as premium as quest but thats a minor feeling i do also wish it had more productivity and leisure apps on their store why in the world would they not include the headphone jack that is kind of dumb in my opinion hey mike is the ability to just load up apk files and install them on the headset easily still in this one cheers sucks if you have a quest and want this you will have to buy all the games again i currently have a quest 1 99percent of the time i am playing pc vr content wirelessly would you recommend the pico 4 or quest 2 as an upgrade great video loved hearing your insight on this product curious if they will ever come to the states does this run android like the quest 2 if all these devices are going to have their own exclusive game stores then i am not buying any of them pcvr for life 13 24 usb c audio amp charge adapter product id cdp2capdm there in adapter from ugreen 3 5mm and usb c both i have it it works great for about 16 dollars holy i did not realized it looked like the one from ready player one 4 33 72hz is smooth i ordered my pico 4 a week ago on aliexpress from china still havnt got it as it only shipped yesterday but hey i still get it early compared to the october 18th release being in usa im hella stoked for it most exited for the comfort and combination of the best 2 headsets the quest 2 tracking and hp reverb resolution quest 2 better thank you for not making clickbaity junk and just doing a straight to the point review nothing with tiktok associations nope who here is buying the quest pro wait is bill burr doing product reviews 4 37 well pancake lenses make it darker and less vibrant 11 27 not gonna lie i have seen a million reviews for that thing already and you have been the only one to mention that so far 11 31 i like that idea taking screenshots in the quest is a pain in the plot i guess those controllers do not have capacitive sensors though 12 05 seems to be a legit design but then the touch pros do not have tracking rings at all and those are compatible with the q2 12 11 bonelabs street puncher mike imma gonna punch them with lead to the head 12 24 honestly i did not expect that because of the cheapo look and i somehow thought those would have to be transparent for that for some reason probably all the controllers with that feature so far having transparent buttons 13 17 afaik there are adapters that have a passthrough usb c port that can not pass through data though so at least it is possible to have an additional battery pack but not corded link 15 43 cries in germany d had to get it from france having a tokyo drift controller and no support probably just trying to get the pro controllers right away instead of bothering getting that one replaced somehow 16 10 yeah bytedance fricken xicoms for anyone jumping on the train now after not getting a quest 2 because of teh zucc being a lizard selling your precious data this is not an alternative btw just do not expect a wired pcvr option that is all i use my quest 2 for if we where scared about our privacy with facebook buying oculus imagine buying a headset made by fckin tiktok if you were seeing the dead pixel in the recording does not that mean it is a software thing not an issue with the screen i had a quest 2 from launch and recently moved abroad but did not bring the headset with me i fancied another and had to choose between buying another quest and keeping my old game library or trying out the new pico glad i went for the pico where i live it is about gbp70 cheaper than the quest but with the lenses screens and other more modern hardware i had to give it a try it really is a nice upgrade over the quest 2 especially in the comfort and weight but you are definitely right about software hopefully the updates keep coming out i am just happy there is competition now it will push everyone forward thanks let is call it the meta killer instead q2 has noticeable sde with movies i wish we can get the pico in the us if not in the oculus ecosystem it is media looks better movies and pc gaming seems better will bonelab be coming to the pico 4 this definitely has my interest when it comes to the us i like my quest 2 but the addition of competitors finally is awesome and i am considering getting one once more games come to it i have a lot of quest games for that headset only not on pc that i would lose though sadly that is a shame great video mike you can get an adapter that has both usb c charging and audio jack those have been around since apple started the remove the headphone jack trend years ago did you have a beta build of the os5 which was released on the 18th or did you only get to use the os4 that it ships with can you play crescendo on rec room with pico 4 great honest review the best yet i must say the pico 4 is the most best looking vr headset so far it has so much style this is a superior product not just an alternative is it worth buying i have a quest 2 and the battery is almost shot is it possible to change the internal battery i can see that the chinese state government has comprised you unsubcribing soundcore vr p10 wireless gaming earbuds you should check these out for headphones i would ask if you have any estimate for the release of the pico 4 pro maybe i live in south africa and have been stuck with a second hand semi broken rift cv1 i decided to bite the bullet and order one from amazon with import costs i am very excited to basically double my resolution and maybe even go wireless always leave a cheeky little like i am most interested with the performance it is trying to push more pixels does the performance suffer games like b amp s n are taxing for the quest2 but what about for this i cannot believe there is no headphone jack wish it released in the us i see the graphical upgrade in blade and sorcery graphics got my one playing in morning great vid bro doing the rounds currently mike can you play android games and programs on the pico aka plex youtube third party 3d flat screen apps amp is there any chance of reverse wireless display for example taking a samsung or huawei and having their desktop mode beamed into pico or a desktop mode heavens never apologise for a review being longer than usual provided it is timestamped there is no such thing as too long or detailed for a review i may upgrade to this from my rift s when vr lens are available for it 14 25 the software looks like a blatant knockoff of the oculus quest ui can you even trust a company that made tiktok all these oj simpson companies rubbing shekels on your data is there any software or something to test if our internet is good enough for virtual desktop what i see as missteps for pico no headphone jack no link version headset having the same name as the company edit it is the pico pico 4 the pancake lenses are the reason it is less bright that will be something that all pancake style headsets suffer from either less bright or larger battery required i am a simple guy i see no bin in thumbnail i click i like positive video i am very sensitive to latency over wi fi what was the lowest possible latency you could achieve using virtual desktop so much smaller then the quest 2 why do you compare them without the light shield it is not like they can be used without what kind of bias review is this what about watching movies is it better than quest 2 i enjoy using big screen and other videos apps on quest no one has said anything about movie quality so just curious thanks do you need a pc for it and do you need one for the cambria bc i will purchase that when it gets out i wonder how it works on linux and if not now ift it will later i am still rocking a rift s and i have not been very happy with it but i also do not wanna buy a quest 2 this might be my new headset it seems pretty darn good is the pico better than the quest 2 i am considering it but i am poor lol if they fix that link quality and somebody makes a 3rd party face cover then it seems perfect 10 15 why would a dead pixel show up on the recording sounds more like a software issue great review look forward to the pro version not worth it quest 2 still superior the pico would be my very first vr headset sooo did i get it right that i can play beat saber and other games via steam thanks for the review mike can you in your view can you tell us how this unit compares to the psvr2 thank you in advance nobody mentions if you login to social apps do you find friends from oculus there does it login to the same social media servers as oculus hey guys i am just thinking about buying my first vr headset i am thinking about pico 4 more sice i will play pc vr mostly but since i never had any vr headset i do not know how all this sw works i understand that there are some exclusive games for both platforms but let is say i want to play beat saber i can play it via pcvr but what about lone echo somewhere i came across information that quest games can be run normally on pc via their app and then streamed to the headset via vr desktop so is it possible to play quest 2 exclusive games this way on pico 4 or do i have to resign myself to losing these games swag man if pico and pico pro manage to supply the world demand it will crush the quest pro is there any news on this headset releasing to north america got my pico 4 today it is a definite hardware upgrade over the quest 2 biggest things i like are the lens and comfort the face gasket has slight light bleed which is annoying but overall if you do not have any vr headset pico 4 is the way to go now for the foreseeable future i bet the guys at pico were very happy when meta announced the msrp of the quest 2 was raised from euros349 to euros449 i have a rift s i am looking for an upgrade but maybe i will wait for quest 3 or something the resolution and fov on the rift s are pretty bad nowadays i would buy it if it got 120 hz for the pico 4 i found for my head that if i raise the headstrap a little bit higher than what feels intuitive i get a much more even pressure distribution on the facial interface i also had the exact same experience with wired wireless pcvr streaming it seems to be locked to 40mbps streaming and the detail is noticably poor until i keep still for about a second or two virtual desktop is significan notly better to the point where i can play even while using a less than ideal router the battery life should definitely be more like 8000mah out of the box but besides that i am loving it on vrchat ppl keep saying its the best yet it just came out and 99 99percent of them never try it alos mike any news on pico 4 pro this or psvr2 are there free games on the pico store is it normal that i lost 20percent of battery only in 20min with pico 4 a cheeky little like on the video how come your content is so similar to other youtube channels like cas and chary vr it seems like you both put out almost exactly the same videos is there some youtube oculus or company sponsorship going on perhaps you should buy one for a fan of the channel when you get sent these early so you actually have some skin in the game i feel like your review would be more believable and also more true to form on what it will be like for retail people to actually buy it could improve the whole experience not saying you are lying but i feel like reviewers really do not seem to realize that there is an extreme risk for you to have an unconscious bias when this is the set up for review you seem like a really nice guy just some food for thought perhaps p s i am not trying to get your free stuff give it to one of these kids or someone with less money who can not afford one if anything i am flawed too not saying i am not do you recommend any specific site to buy it im located in mexico im going to buy a headset and i was on the fence between quest 2 or pico 4 will be mainly using it for pcvr mike what is the ps5 vr like compared topico4 hp reverb g2 plz no one else has mentioned them keep up the good work m8 me wow mike is such a wholesome youtuber mike motions middle finger up and down me wtf preordered one coming from the original quest wanted something for pc vr as well as getting out of the meta ecosystem before getting sucked in completely let is see how it goes looks promising at least were not there just yet but 2025 will be insane thanks mike great video as ever completion in the vr space can only be a good thing i have a quest 2 and am hoping that the quest 3 can learn from the quest pro i know the quest 3 is not a pro upgrade i mean tech wise for gaming and pico 4 to be a real step up hopefully next year i was about to buy the neo 4 until i saw that vrchat was not on pico store i love my quest but i need the pico for the ipd and i also wanna try the new controllers so sad about not being able to play vrchat on the pico wow pico straight up cloned the quest 2 software 100percent we will see vr goggles the size of sunglasses within 5 years was really hoping that the pico would be comfortable so that i can forget that im wearing it during a movie would virtual desktop work with the link cable or with the dongle adapter pico is going to release stop recommending these products to people it is literally owned by the ccp it is not care about permissions it steals everything it can and very very soon as soon as conflict breaks out they have no obligation to continue supporting it software wise these are the same people that blatantly steal copyrighted materials left and right on a daily basis look at the headset itself for fuck sakes it is a quest to with a black strip in the bottom that was developed without having to innovate anything simply using hardware that is 3 years more advantageous because of when it came out and then comparing them like they are apples and oranges any money you send to them leaves the country and never comes back and fuels the war machine you have an ethical obligation to not push this crap i was very pumped to see a non quest headset until i saw it was made by tiktok pass upgrading from a rift s i feel like i am gonna need some extra stuff like vr desktop and maybe even the bobovr batteries to not have it be a downgrade from direct pcvr yet for wireless tech aswell as how fed up i am with my worsening set i would buy it one way or another shame a 20dollar software is the only good method for pc streaming tho real surprised pico is own app is not as good mike great review as always i primarily use quest 2 for pcvr and you mentioned it is not a generational leap forward however given the better lenses and better resolution will i notice a significan not clarity difference and is beat saber properly playable at something like expert where very fast movement is necessary i keep hearing the video compression is really bad and virtual desktop is the way forward is it good enough for beat saber and similar games in your opinion great review mike love how everyone flips the bird when showing hand tracking lol my wifi is 530mbps download and 30 40mbps upload is that good enough for virtual desktop great vid can not wait for mine to arrive d what personal data do you need to give for a pico account facebook tik tok wow no headphone jack what a trash design sure it is a simple thing that some may not use but being able to charge and hear properly simultaneously keeps the quest 2 ahead in my book i wonder if something like resident evil could just be sideloaded whats the diffrence in a pico neo and just pico being a lighter headset it will be a great addition to my quest2 i am retired so i can use the quest2 in the morning for my holofit and fitrx and in the evening take out the pico and play some bonelab half life alyx mods or minigolf and at the moment half life 2 vr during those games is when i feel the weight of the quest most looking forwards to get the pico4 hi mike do you notice the warp scaling error of the pico 4 which causes your view to slightly warp if you turn your head this has already been an issue on the pico 3 reported serveral times to the developers but has not been resolved yet even with the lastest firmware on the pico 4 the wrong scaling is present on both native and pcvr and should never have been approved by quality control in my opinion some people may not notice this but if you have had other headsets like the rift or quest 2 you immediately should see that there is something off here in some games it is not that apparent but others are just unplayable and feel jittery as hell i like brightness and game access quest 2 it is thanks mike hi vro i was wondering if you would suggest buying a pico 4 if you are going from a quest 1 with link waiting for pico 4 pro a great quest pro alternative the audio bluetooth latency will be an issue i had thought that they would remove the compression needed for pcvr by now was not there supposed to be a optional dedicated dongle to connect directly to the pc would not that help in removing the compression requirement otherwise this is a great product i hope they make those improvements in the next iteration if they can use oled display with higher refresh rate then that would be amazing was that a g shoch watch oh man what a review really well done i still got the oculus rift s i love this device absolutely do but it is getting old now the fov of that thing is just ruining a lot of immersion i might now order the pico 4 soon thanks to this review but i might still wait for the lenovo vr700 not sure yet i really do not like this move for headsets using magnetic padding it probably is fine at this level of strength of magnets but it is a fact that we know that magnets can affect the brain in various ways the most dramatic of which is if you put a strong enough one over a specific area it will affect the fusiform face gyrus which will result in you not being able to see faces while its in place again there is probably nothing to worry about in this vr headset use case but i would just prefer other methods of attachment for such things myself a ccp tech device is never a great alternative if this and the quest 2 are neck and neck not needing a facebook account to use the pico 4 easily gives it the w for me woah i am skipping out on this device tiktok is even worse than facebook i will just stick with windows mixed reality it might not be 4k but you are headset is not owned by these people i have nothing nice to say about tiktok it really is a surveillence system do not buy the pico headset get a samsung hmd odyssey windows mixed reality headset it is good enough more resolution but worse display less weight but less comfortable mmmmh i would defenitily buy a pico but they are not sold in country yet it looks like a very good alternative although it seems to be the same experience you would have with a quest 2 even the interface arrangement layout widget and window colors all look the same as the quest 2 i wonder if pico found that meta s software experience is already great and just trying to copied the same in order catch some of that audience anyway great video mike you are my favorite vr youtuber it is always very exciting to see you upload new videos and thrilling to see them i have received my pico 4 around 2 weeks ago and i have enjoyed it alot i generally play pcvr games and i did not know about virtual desktop thanks for the information virtual reality oasis could you provide an update to let us know if prescription lens inserts are available for new devices like this one because i got snap in lenses for quest 2 and i can never go back to wearing glasses under a vr headset you can use usb c adaptor that has both 3 5mm jack and usb c passthrough pico market is kind of new just compared with the quest store 2 years ago its a much bigger gamestore that quest had and yes everything is better at this headset hardware wise as the quest for me its still a questkiller how perfectly you drew your boundary was eerily satisfying i guess if you have the original quest this would be a great upgrade lol how did you record the dead pixel great review thankyou are you sure it is a dead pixel you would not be able to record it without capturing through the lense footage imo the lack of an audio jack is stupid love watching your videos the most honest review i have seen yet it is not a quest killer great review mike i am glad it ran a little long as it allowed you to give us a thorough sense of what all the aspects of the pico 4 are all about honestly i am looking at the pico neo 3 since i only need a pcvr headset and want something that is a little more robust visually speaking than my rift s so far as i can tell the price is about the same and the g2 may be a bit too much for my pc is specs since i am only running a 3060ti should i make that leap or hold on until the quest 3 finally comes out or should i wait until black friday and go ahead and get the g2 anyway is there any screen door effect was that half life 7 30 meta still has the best software the ui looks more polished and modern good review i will wait for the quest 3 and bought a second hand quest 2 for euros260 as new i would rather invest in a ecosystems which is partly developped by and under supervision of goat john garmack than a company which is steered by the chinese government ccp has a huge stake in bytedance which ownes pico it is a proper rip off if ur thinking of buying a quest 2 for the 1st time buy this as it soo uch better and there is very few negatives where as quest 2 is near the end of its life it looks like they copied so much from oculus i see it as a hardware vs software issue the pico looks like a generally better headset but meta still has a huge leg up due to its exclusives like beat saber etc if someone found a way to port these exclusives to pico i would buy it in a heartbeat it really just depends on what you value more quest 3 in 2023 thanks mike i have one coming from amazon tomorrow for my pcvr library which i built up when i owned an index valves lack of wireless support which they promised years ago made me sell my index and i refused to buy into metas ecosystem so this seems perfect for wireless pcvr which i have waited years for thanks i wish it was in the us pico feels more like copi for pc vr players in germany this is a dream there is till this point still no quest 2 available at official resellers when you are mostly playing pc vr and will change a better feeling face padding anyway this is in every single way a better choice not saying it is better than quest 2 overall but definitely a headset more suited for my need i have no money for this so i will keep using quest 2 for as long as possible hopefully someone can answer this for me if i have virtual desktop on steam will i still need to buy it on the pico store to use with pico 4 i feel like in many ways it is two steps forward one step back good design in the strap with properly balanced weight but you can not replace it decent ish audio but no 3 5mm headphone jack pancake lenses and high res display but sluggish os skin comfortable and decently tracked controllers but bulky and heavy and also hard to make grips for due to their strange shape color passthrough but monoscopic and headache inducing i hope software support will improve the headset wherever possible and i hope first party hardware support with accesories will fix some of the issues because right now it is looking good but not as good as i hoped can u fix a dead pixel hmmm i will have to look into this might be a competitor for the quest great coverage it is a quest 2 competitor and that is what we really need right now to make the market both more accessible and interesting does this include a modded beat saber after side quest come outs getting away from a facebook required account is worth it to me i think it is sad that no one commented on facebook lying about removing the requirement last year at this years facebook connect event so a quest 2 minus the meta facebook part that is a win win in my book 3 23 clean your lens please wow they just ripped the ui right from oculus it looks good we just need some killer games what would be your recommendations for someone who has no vr headset at all and is wondering which one to get between the pico 4 and the quest 2 let is say someone who would use both stand alone and pcvr play some half life alyx workshop maps they are unlimited and as good as the game it is all i play in vr why they do not add a dam micro sd slot is behond me the quest has a blurry look to it when i play it just dosent look super clear and sharp when i watch a video feed of someone playing it live is the pico have this same issue how much light in the room do you need to use this headset can i play in the dark i am not buying this since i ai not trying to support tiktok 1 19 can we just appreciate this editing nice great review thanks does it still look like you looking into a binocular in the pico 4 headset cus thats what annoy me the most with quest 2 is that the black stuff around your vision was not expecting that full rick sanchez while testing the hand tracking but there you were lol a sleek sexy balanced light comfortable beautiful usable design this is the first case where i see a need for an american company to copy from a chinese company haha i was literally binging reviews from channels i was not sure about but then this comes out just in time thanks a bunch the reason i will never buy a quest product is their data harvesting and abhorrent privacy policy how does this compare definitely upgrading from my rift s can not wait to see what wireless pcvr has to offer this seems like a genuinely good option i will give u leopard for it lol pre ordered for more power and better lenses also much better controllers than quest 2 shame its not a halo type headset not sure i trust the company either mike you deserved a like from me for not calling it a quest killer i would love to swap this with my quest 2 for virtual desktop with my vrchat full body setup but i am in the us i am hoping for the vrcover too i agree that is what it really needs where the 4k is it a good standalone vr headset as i do not have a gaming pc was waiting for the psvr2 but not sure i want wired vr its from china and the personal data given is extreme no its not a great alternative its actually only slightly worst unless of course you do not care about the ethical and moral dilemma of not owning your own digital shadow then yeah go for it sell a little bit more of yourself to them thank you for providing such amazing content they just stole oculus i bought the pico neo 3 link like 3 months ago because i did not know the 4 was coming out do you think that is an l amazing vid keep up the great work dude much love got my pico 4 2 days ago but the face cushion is so freaking uncomfortable but you would say that since it was free i love to see that the vr industry is expanding and some more great headsets are entering the market 10th new mike headset review let is go whenever i think of pico i just think of the sauce i am gonna get the pico neo 4 on crismas thanks for the vid loving the content the pico 4 looks so cool i always love it when you come out the new video first hi the pico 4 imo is better than the quest 2 because of the weight balance not being more on your forehead and the way the strap and lenses fit on my face and head feels much better than the quest 2 good evening awesome thank you very much extremly healthy forever young very beautiful the best of luck a lot of money gold diamonds prosperity wealthy abundance harmony happiness and success in your life is among us already available to the pico 4 if so how much it cost if it was not for the only fact that pico 4 library is way more limited i would surely chose it now i am always in a stalemate between quest 2 quest 3 and pico 4 suggestions any suggestions on how to get a new or like new one since i heard they are not available in the us thanks i am new to exploring vr gaming so pardon my ignorant questions if it is connected to a pc for pcvr gaming can i still use my pc speakers for the sound output instead of the speakers on the headset or will i be hearing audio output from both the headset and my speakers and also i have heard about having to sign up for an account or something when using those meta vr headsets does this require an account if it does is an account absolutely necessary for pcvr gaming especially for flight and racing sims love the pico 4 can you use hotspot on iphone 13 to connect too pico 4 looking at getting one but no wifi show do not tell will ya quest 3 was able to connect to my pc through wifi 6 and it had no lag can this headset do that too any devices with removable batteries is a big plus for me i use rechargeable aa and aaa batteries i have a bunch of them fully charged whenever needed you do a quick swap instead of waiting for them to charge and there are no worries of an internal battery that is difficult to replace when it breaks down does it have any apps to watch cinema with your own 3d movie files i just want a vr headset capable of watching vr movies while not having a fucking facebook account is is good for that can i use virtual desktop to play wireless with my pc am i missing something or did you not really mention the visuals or compare to anything for reference rewatch your video and start counting how many times you touch your glasses and do not include the times you touch them when you actually are mentioning your glasses i will bet you did not realize you are doing it that much in the span of 16 minutes just watched a video with norm from tested and he has the same tic i love my pico 4 i have had it since launch sitting on about 70 games would also mention you are still able to connect your bluetooth headphones unfortunately the pico 4 is not available in the us still will the fiber optic link cable keep this charged while playing how do movies and youtube look compared to the q2 so i got a totally noob question that i can not seem to find the answer to anywhere online i recently bought a pico 4 and im trying to figure out how to change the profile pic from the default yellow dog to one of my avatars that i created if anyone can answer that for me id greatly appreciate it tia can you use a headset plugged into your pc if you plug the pico into the pc to use for vr audio waiting for the quest 3 let me see which is better it is just my first week into pico 4 i am a quest user but the pico system has so much freedom i can finally use discord without headashes the extra ram makes a lot of difference besides the weaker library of games and apps i really think that the pico 4 is a way best option if you want a vr headset definelly not a master upgrade if you are coming from quest 2 but for sure a best hardware can it play pavlov and hot dog horseshoes and handgrenades and blade and sorcery do you need a pc to use it i tried my friend quest 2 and pico 4 pico 4 lenses look much better and the out of the box strap the balanced weight give superior experience i liked the headset for its features but in some ways it is simply the better option because it had the advantage of being a new headset vs a 2 year old headset and vr tech moves pretty quickly the pico 4 is 430 euro and the quest 2 is 300 euro which makes the pico 4 a bit more of a tough sell i also prefer the more fine tuned software of the quest 2 but for pure pcvr the pico 4 is the better one but is it worth the 130 euro extra not sure especially with the quest 3 approaching i was not sure about the pico 4 as i already had a meta quest 2 but about a month ago i decided to take the plunge and buy one hey i am so glad i did as it is leaps and bounds better than my quest 2 so much so i ended up selling it the one thing i regret knowing what i know now is that i should of made the switch to pico 4 sooner anyone on the fence and not sure do not be you will not be dissapointed oh your light issue maybe as you say your face shape as i have had no light coming through at all complete darkness you can also get a small adaptor for a headset only cost gbp3 dollar4 ebay can i be a pin please if i was not already planning on investing in psvr2 then this definitely seems like something i would be interested in vr is fantastic one thing i always tell people before they pull the trigger on any vr is to do research on what they want out of their headset and what experiences they want to get out of it i am not sure how the pico marketplace looks but hopefully its comparable to the meta quest store and the application selection is decent thanks for your insight from your time using it great video lono keep up the great work seems like a pretty legit unit for the price if i did not get motion sickness i would probably pull the trigger on it actually did not even think about the space aspect ans how itd benefit being truely wireless but your coverage of this device has been pretty tip top dude what a bad unboxing video vr is great i have been playing since the original rift horror games are my favorite horror just hits different in vr thanks for the full unboxing and showing me everything in the box i am just buying this headset now and wondering what i am going to get you skipped nothing in the entire thing which i like conveniently this was uploaded 2 days ago as well my last headset was the rift s and i still have it but i am going wireless because i just love the idea of its portability and it is just the better headset upgrade also would like to tell you that walking dead saints and sinners is one of the only good horror vr games in my opinion it is got some rough things to get it running perfectly but it is a great game once it works right i am already big into steamvr and pcvr and also recommend you play a modded skyrimvr someday in your life the absolute best vr game i have ever played because well skyrim is my favorite game ever made yoooo lono well well well was not yah one of those turned out on vr motion sickness whatever just kidding lol glad you found fun in the vr ecosystem and is super sweet folks are reaching out to yah to check this stuff out xd for some the barrier to get into vr is kinda huge i get it plus some of the experiences available surely are sketchy but when its good is actually awesome hope you like playing around w it for me space themed games are the most fun headsets usually feel like wearing a helmet or breather mask so it gets immersive organically cheers homie xd great video the all in one aspect is great my daughter was listening to the video as i am making dinner she said you should get that lol as my source for game play and gaming news i was excited to see you get the pico 4 i am looking forward to seeing the performance of an all in one system as that makes a purchase much more straight forward please keep us up to date on the play tests vr is not a niche market anymore it seems like every time you turn around somebody got a vr headset coming out really glad and excited looks like a quest 2 just a bit updated looking forward to seeing how it performs any ideas on what games your going to test out please play the final fantasy 16 demo people are saying it is the best demo they ever played interested to see some gameplay on this vs things like the quest 2 fancy little gadget looks pretty slick been thinking about getting some vr think it is better then the ps5 vr  been looking around options for a vr headset looking forward to seeing the review tighten up lono need that gameplay lol can not wait to see this one now i am member i am going to see what i have missed cool looking headse it is kinda exciting to see vr take off in the way that it has back gg on the review i can not wait to see you play some games looking forward to seeing you use the pico and review it great review reforge this unit looks interesting love the double camera angle more unboxing vids pls oh em gee i can not believe it is an actual pico 4 excited to hear about this\n",

      "this is the first affordable pancake headset and according to reviewers it features bigger fov than the quest 2 too bad it is a bytedance product though i am pretty new to the world of vr what is the issue with bytedance it is basically chinese facebook no no no its much much worse fb at least has us scrutiny now and is being sued up the ass for past mistakes bytedance has no accountability and privacy policy is meaningless not true the device is being distributed in europe and so has to comply with our strict regulations additionally this headset does not require any login edit it does need a login listen to be fair requires no social media account would entail no login to most people right am i crazy for thinking that regardless they were one step ahead of me on this one so it turns out pico accounts technically are not social media accounts sick of this bollucks  here as in gonna be interesting to see how this turns out chinese companies are famous for obeying regulations eu is famous for bullying companies which ignore the law and has the biggest expertise on this subject us dgaf well we are trying to stop tiktok is eu doing that chinese bots be downvoting you says the person who is hopelessly pretending that a software update will never come with such a new requirement he lied it does require login now not really eu does not dictate what goes on with data on servers in other countries just like nobody really dictates that besides the company itself which only happens after you log in germany in particular ceased q2 sales after the mandatory login was created companies absolutely build profiles of you without you needing to log in that is why stuff like tracking cookies exist and with that study that demonstrated you only need 5 seconds minutes of head and hand motion data to be able to uniquely identify a person it is pretty scary tbh that sounds a bit insane 5 secs of head and hand motion to identify person can you please point me to that study my mistake it is not 5 seconds but still pretty insane although the possibility for gait biometrics has been known for decades now and the chinese government has reportedly already been implementing it since 2018 i think a lot of earlier technologies kind of oversold their accuracy but they were almost exclusively based on optical analysis having direct motion tracker data not to mention the machine learning explosion that is occurred in recent years makes the stanford study totally believable to me even though their sample size was only 500 ah so the pico 4 has no login did not know that that is at least somewhat better not sure if that means no online gaming because that would be a problem that little shit is lying he must have no idea what he is talking about i should point out that i learned this may be useless as pcvr seems to require virtual desktop which needs to be downloaded with an account so unless you can download with a computer and usb without an account which you really should this may be meaningless apologies for confusion i am equally confused would appreciate if someone could definitively figure out whether pico 4 allows for external apk downloads the reason for quest 2 not being sold in germany was the facebook login it was changed from oculus to facebook now that its back to meta account it will be sold again soon and of cause you need some sort of account to link purchases and avatar to etc if you do not want to play alone you need to be able to find friends so an account is needed at makes sense only suspicion rises due to the fact that pico is a bytedance company and there maybe a point to it in the end if i buy it i will still surely not be kidnapped robbed hacked or anything else also if i ever visit china they wont greet me by my name and say ahhhh you finaly come over they will be able to see my name birthday address and what games i play for how long and so on should i ever need to go to china likely as i travel a lot for work but so far not china they have everything personal anyways whats a bit nagging though is that any device with a microphone or camera can give a lot more information if programmed to do so i guess thats what most ppl are concerned about but im not too sure one is better than the other if you are against data collection and want to be safe do not buy any smart things smartphone smartwatch smarthome alexa etc but having a quest 2 alexa smart tv s plus using google without vpn and then fearing the pico doesnt make sense i am not that strong when it comes to resisting new tech so im a data bitch its ok they are releasing their product in the most strict privacy law region on this planet a region where meta facebook can not even sell their devices legally because it already breaks three laws in germany pico on the hand can sell and obligate to eu law that makes it a lot more trustworthy than meta facebook products in regards to privacy and other legal questions please do some research on bytedance you are just making an ass of yourself here claiming they are trustworthy then come back and make your argument i will wait dude just spoke to what they knew about the situation and you were plainly rude as a response get over yourself they are already more trustworthy than facebook meta do not worry eu will fuck them up should they try something it is not the us where you can do what you want and just get away with it as a company woah woah woah chinese paid bot here the chinese government told me to tell you that privacy is number 1 priority that is why we need your personal information it is to keep you safe safe from our enemies like orange man and randy marsh bytedance is simply just a big security network working to keep you safe now have a good day ah ok well that sucks yea it is either meta sells your data or china sells really any other country i would not care about but china fuck that they own tiktok you could have just said tik tok lol it is the parent company of tiktok and a chinese tech giant company and like most tech giants has been involved with questionable practices plus it has close ties with the chinese gov afaik maybe one day we will get a decent budget headset from a not awful company probably not though since to release a headset at that price point you kind of have to be a tech giant and as you said most tech giants are at least a bit dodgy you do not have to be a tech giant to release at a low price point you just have to make collecting and selling user data a priority to cover loses on hardware or you have to sell enough software to offset the loss on hardware just like nearly every console in history it is not that complicated nah at the price point the quest 2 was selling software sales still would not be enough make up for it it was estimated the quest 2 was selling basically at the price of its components so not accounting for labor and logistics costs or the massive amount of r amp d meta has been conducting does not seem to be much different with the pico the vr space has way more potential to creep into everyday parts of your life aside from just gaming and we should all be more weary of letting companies like meta and bytedance take control yeah they are likely releasing this headset with a subsidized price and planning to gain back profits through their sales on their store lets not be foolish they may also sell data or at least use it to advertise something to you question is if this bothers you or not chances that 3 chineese guys come to your house to build a humancentipad are close to 0 but never say never if you agreed to tos the lynx looks promising the communist party of china uses bytedance products such as tik tok for surveillance and espionage the ccp also freely censors content on bytedance products and uses it to push propaganda gt the communist party of china uses bytedance products such as tik tok for surveillance and espionage as the united states does with us based social media products as per the eu did not offer adequate protection for eu data when it was shipped overseas because u s surveillance law were too intrusive so does america with amazon and do does google they will have to obey europes gdpr if they want to sell their product here just out of curiosity who and how is actually checking if they do so are they required to submit source code for evaluation and what about updates of that code yea i got excited about the price then realized bytedance was behind it yea fuck that xi can keep his shit the quest 2 is fov really sucks indeed yeah i cannot express my disappointment when i found that out if you do not have to log in to any account what is the issue you do you have to have a pico account also no login does not mean no data collection like at all any marketer will tell you there is a thousand ways to build a profile on you without an account my personal bias friend of mine is a programmer and was doing a job repurposing drones they had decided on a certain manufacturer and got a bunch of parts i was at his place and he was showing me all this junk code that was taking gps pic data and sending it somewhere he was going through and just deleting all of it also the fact that tiktok is known to take image data and compile it as well as north american not just us ban on chinese internet infrastructure and ongoing removal process of any of this existing hardware i am sure at the end of the day there is not much i can do google facebook or prc somebody gonna get that data so it is bias logging in is not a prerequisite for having your data taken yeah between facebook and tiktok headsets i choose neither i am just over here waiting for index 2 and then we can wait 3 extra years for it to be released in australia yeah it really sucks that it is made by them it is a good thing the quest 2 is not made by a social media monopoly in progress who will collect every piece of information about you for profit that would be crazy pick your poison too bad quest is a facebook product though what is the difference between bytedance having your info or facebook having it ones a murderous regime who engages in genocide and oppression of its own people and seeks to dominate as much of the world as it can the other is run by a sociopath lizard man who is helping sow the seeds of the destruction of democracy all in the name of profit and to jam more advertising down your throat choose your posion based on your descriptions i do not know which one is which but i live in the us and not china so what can china do to me nothing what can the us do to me everything but afaik unlike scummy facebook did in past this company does not require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset bytedance has no accountability and private information has already been shown to be accessed from china this violates most countries privacy laws but unlike fb being evil in the past bd is evil in past and now look it up fb being evil in the past dude what you say that like it is over with well now they are paying the piper both in brand loyalty see stock decline and massive lawsuit losses so being better now is basically about money and survival in this level of scrutiny so if you are suggesting meta is doing any worse than bd now i would like to know what that is honest curiosity bytedance willingly gives full access to user data to the communist party of china gt but afaik unlike scummy facebook did in past this company does not require that you create a social media account in order to use this headset to use meta headsets you still need to create a social media account for horizon with followers following etc it is just not the facebook social media but another new one made by the same company for vr you can not have a meta account without a horizon social profile meta are even opening up the horizon app soon to allow smartphone users to join this new social networking app and use it without needing a vr device neither did oculus facebook just waited til they got their numbers up then pulled the trigger on data collection it is very likely bytedance will do the same thing considering how much data they get from tiktok it would make sense for them to pull the same thing oculus did do we know if this has the same power xr2 as quest as far as i know it is somewhat heavily underclocked in quest so i am wondering if pico 4 should have the same performance the pico 4 should be the same or even better because it has more ram than the quest 2 8gb compare to 6gb better the quest 2 is underclocked because of insufficient cooling the pico 4 runs the xr2 at full clock rate wow really that should mean good 20 30percent perfesnce improvement at same resolution right and combined with more ram this could be nice performance upgrade over quest2 by the sounds of it better performance but it is being consumed by the higher resolution displays which is exactly where i would like it to be used not pre ordering anything i will just wait till people got actual time on it i do not trust the wireless vr you ever tried a quest 2 with a proper router set up for it wireless vr works just as well as wired for me but is 100percent better imo so freeing not having a wire in the way or pulling on the headset as i move crouch when ceiling mounted plus if i am just going on beat sabre or something that does not need a load of room i can play in my kitchen without having to move all my settee from living room where i play when i need room i went back to the index the delay hurts in multiplayer competitive games i have played on it yes decent router in the same room still felt a bit of delay in faster songs but it is livable yea but i am mostly just not sure about pico is implementation i found using virtual desktop helped me and you need to make sure if you did not already that the quest 2 is the only device on the 5ghz band make sure there is no traffic management on the router as well and you should be good i would not say it is 100percent perfect all the time but then cable never was either at least with my rift i have never really played quest 2 wired other than quick testing because wireless has always worked so well for me i would be cautious of the pico 4 too though may turn out to be great and i really hope it does as we need more quest 2 competitors especially around the same price range gt i am mostly just not sure about pico is implementation for dollar10 you do not have to worry about pico is crap software virtual desktop is in the pico store and is bulletproof  gt i would not be surprised if they had some custom low level software to send data to their servers even without an account the eu has far stricter privacy laws than the us and they are launching there first i would not worry about that when you say wired do you mean quest wired or a native wired hmd just for clarification as quest wired is far from ideal as well i had a rift originally quest 2 wireless works as well as my rift did wired i have also tried quest 2 wired for a short time when i got a new router from isp and wireless started lagging ok i would have to say in that case that due to the rifts very aged hardware that your comparison of wireless vr working just as well as wired is not completely true i can definitely believe it works just as well as wired quest i experience the same to the point my link cable is unused for a year however compared to an index or any other native wired hmd of comparable quality there is a significan not visual difference not sure which rift you mean but i have both and tested q2 for a couple of weeks over airlink q2 looks a lot worse than rift s and maybe a little better than cv1 the res of course is massively bigger than cv1 but compression is brutal over usb it looks a little bit better than rift s but still was not worth upgrading now people are saying it is massively better with virtual desktop using hevc compression but unfortunately i have not tried that i had not played pcvr for a while when bonelab came out and i was really impressed at how good airlink has gotten i upgraded to a wifi 6 router last year and it was already good when the network was not busy but now i can play while my partner is streaming tv in the same room and it works great yeah that is mainly because of the optimization and coding work done by meta just because it works with airlink and your quest like that does not mean it will on pico it supports cables for link i find it amusing that people are buying a headset from a chinese company because they are concerned about privacy with the facebook meta headsets quite instead of buying a headset where your data is held and sold by a private company that has at least a semblance of a responsibility with it it will be sent to a communist government thats known to spy on its citizens lmao semblance of responsibility jesus christ everyone already forgot cambridge analytica well i assume he means that they are one of the most highly scrutinized companies in us now they are being sued up the ass for those mistakes i think bytedance simply cannot have the same checks and balances us gov pretty much flat out said stop using their apps due to access violations exactly this when stuff goes wrong both people and the government typically come into play in china the court systems are not fair so you do not need to worry about people and your basically a direct arm of the government when they want you to be if your doing something its in their interest especially if it is something you should not be doing the breach of data caused by a third party app not associated with facebook that harvested data participants willingly gave despite it being illegally sold to political campaigns under false pretenses facebook was fined by the ftc for not doing enough to vet the app in the first place however they purportedly shut them down when the breach was discovered there is a lot we can blame facebook for but this one was not primarily on them cambridge analytica did not abuse some obscure security bug what they did is what they were technically but not legally allowed to do they violated the terms of service when information was transferred from kogan is thisisyourlife app to ca kogan is app was however allowed to gather all of this data just not transfer it to others according to facebook is chief security officer at the time alex stamos kogan did not break into any systems bypass any technical controls our use a flaw in our software to gather more data than allowed he did however misuse that data after he gathered it but that does not retroactively make it a breach also not everyone or indeed most of the people willing gave their data to thisisyourlife much less ca their friends gave their data to thisisyourlife and it is unlikely their friends understood the extent of the data being given to thisisyourlife facebook was exceptionally sloppy with user data and actually advertised that sloppiness to other companies it is not like thisisyourlife was the only one hovering up user data like this it was an advertised feature of the platform for crying out loud we can completely blame facebook for companies using features of facebook is platform that facebook openly advertised cambridge analytica was not a meta company did ca actually break any laws i thought part of what made that whole thing horrifying was that it was all legal that is the semblance of responsibility only illegal thing i recall is providing services for free so as to avoid going over campaign spending limits and even that is a grey area immoral for sure but not illegal i could be totally wrong and would happily be corrected on this it is been a while since i thought about this stuff nobody said anything about legality it is irresponsible to leak all that data that is the thing it was not really leaked it was legally given semblance of responsibility that is a good one the us government has access to the data of us companies so your comparison is wrong either compare company to company or government to government do not mix apples with oranges do not be naive bytedance is selling your data to advertisers too i guess i could see the logic in saying that it is less likely to be a problem for you personally to have your data controlled by a foreign government than the one of the country you live in because that foreign government does not have any jurisdiction over you not sure i follow your logic you do not think they will sell your data to anyone who wants it like us companies do not to be a contrarian but what does this realistically mean for the average joe my life is not that interesting absolutely nothing except you might get a scary negative number next to your reddit comment nothing at all i do not really bother about this stuff either for some people it is just a matter of privacy though it would not ruin your life if someone took a video of you taking a shit and put it on the internet for all to see that does not mean you would be happy for people to film you in the bathroom though i would buy it if it was in the us i have a quest 2 and a valve index i am just going to use it with virtual desktop on steam anyway the hardware is better than anything meta has out right now at the price point absolutely understandable to be weary of fb and or bytedance however i do not like the gatekeeping that goes on in this sub if people do not share your concern about it then that is totally fine and you should not be looking down upon them let people enjoy what they want it is quite the thing to behold really as if a login changes the data collected or prevents them from knowing everything about you and everything you do as someone else pointed out though and i have to agree on this point eu privacy regulations are quite strict and the pico has to comply with them to be sold so you are actually safer with any headset in europe as opposed to any headset in the us they do it right over there  username checks out you dropped the r the only thing that stops me from ordering it is the lack of dp connection double penetration hope you have your dp cable at hand for the session it when you need to connect both displayport and usb cables not all in one cable youre into some freaky stuff bro cool instead of letting meta spy on me i will let the ccp spy on me eh i already have tiktok gathering all that info on me anyway that sucks when i said i wanted more affordable vr competition from other companies i did not mean bytedance lol i mean who else could do it the deckard is 100percent gonna be over dollar500 and the psvr2 requires a ps5 until the community makes it work with pc we are looking at you apple ms google wtf microsoft is focusing on enterprise military with the hololens and windows mixed reality is pretty much abandoned google barely put any effort into it and failed apple is still working on it and the first generation will probably be expensive and who knows if they will even have traditional controllers or let virtual desktop into the app store i know right p but this headset would cost around gbp800 gbp1200 without data collection it is bad enough letting fuckbook into my home no way will i let the ccp in is it possible to play games from the oculus store on this headset only oculus pcvr games and only through 3rd party software revive or virtual desktop why is it so cheap whats the catch bytedance you do not pay with money generous subsidies by the ccp honestly a unique advantage to their products yeah i know data harvesting bytedance this and that but most people do not give a shit including me if people truly cared then tiktok would not be a global sensation the good thing is they target the eu market first eu has the ability to actually handle such things and enforces privacy protection if it would have first released in the us than we certanly would be fucked you are the product only if it had dp connection clear pancake lenses all so i can see compression clearly im glad i havent owned a dp headset now i do not know what im missing xd my progression psvr gt quest 1 link cable gt pico 4 vd over wifi will not be available for us market tho not yet though someone mentioned that amazonuk will ship to the us now so you might wanna check it bear in mind that there may be unforeseen issues trying to use it in an unsupported country is it worth getting this over a quest 2 if i want to try some pcvr too i am taking a chance on it but you may want to wait for release to see what people think gt you may want to wait for release to see what people think this is the correct answer on all gen 1 hardware all the time i wish we could just discuss the hardware everything i have read watched points to this being an awesome headset the only thing stopping me is i want more mr features which this does not appear to have due to the lack of 3d pass through and depth sensor otherwise the weight and balance of it is so enticing i am sick of cumbersome bricks on my face and the rumours of the next quests still having the battery in the front with the soft strap is so annoying this is exactly why i am giving it a try d and i am coming from quest 1 which is particularly brick like xd ah sweet another device that is cheap only because of data that will pay for it all on its own even if you do not need to make an account if it requires internet access then it can begin to start profiling you instantly that is pretty crazy when it comes to a device that can track your movement amp got multiple cameras that detect the local area nearly all around it also it is apparently by a chinese company so sheesh facebook ai not no saint but the us govt is pretty upset with them meanwhile china would praise this company for taking data from its consumers and not give a shit what happens to said data afterwards and for anyone who says but they can not do that they do not care they will also attempt to hide its activities by detecting when it is being monitored and shut off the collection processes this behavior has been observed in a chinese app before so i would not be surprised if you only intend on using this for pcvr you do not need internet access other than upon first use when installing updates after that you can completely disconnect it from the internet and only connect to a router hooked up to your pc for vd or air link streaming this does not give the headset any internet access afaik or with some routers you can use parental control and whitelist a random website entirely unrelated with bytedance or outright block the internet at least tp link routers still allow you to connect locally even with both of those being used why are half the posts here taking about data collection xd people were mad at meta because they combined their vr device accounts with their social media accounts which is stupid for many reasons not because of data collection almost every electronic device you own is collecting your data and most of them are made assembled in china xd most of them are made and assembled there but not owned by a company there that reports its data back to the chinese government and if you think the data coming from a tied social media account was not the concern then well i have a chinese government to sell you the tied social media account was the concern data collection is a privacy problem the point i am making is you can not get away from it unless you do not buy most modern technology not just any chinese company bytedance the company behind tiktok  i swear society is getting paranoid for good reason the data they collect is what feeds the ai learning algorithms which will ultimately decide the fate of nations in the coming century sounds crazy but that is the era we are living in oh no they are going to make advertisements that work better all of you have reddit accounts you think this is not scrutinized you think every single google search you do is not scrutinized none of you have ever in your lives read the terms of service go ahead and give china more ammo against us chinese oppression is a bit different than the useful products google uses our data for quest 2 to undo recent price increase bro people here are way too paranoid lmao y all gotta chill out with ya tinfoil hats i do not get what is the big deal with them taking my data unless it comes back to me in the form of ads i do not really care if they use my data to feed any sort of ai like wtf are they even gonna do with it yall making it seem like i am contributing to the construction of a doomsday machine for real like i may be wrong but what the hell is a chinese company gonna do with a us citizens data that isnt ad marketing purposes nice price but i can not spend another 370 euros after 2 years with so little quality vr content around the trick is to buy a better headset then replay every game you ever liked to see all the texture detail you missed out on the first time xd i did exactly this with half life 2 for a decade between 2004 and 2014 now let is do the same with alyx i will keep an eye out then i am hoping for a standalone valve headset at some point so i have an easier time with steam fucking hell that is cheap the competition has arrived  i will be exclusively using this for pcvr over wifi with virtual desktop d  yeah man that is literally it once you load into virtual desktop there is even a button in the system that says launch steam vr and it does it for you p honestly i do not know either but im hearing good things from news and reviews the headset is cheap enough for me to take a chance on it fairly seamless open vd on pc open vd on headset hit launch steamvr yep it is that easy virtual desktop has a streaming app you launch on your pc and it gives your headset full access to your desktop i have the quest 1 how is this an upgrade and is it a lot better also does it connect to my pc ah another quest 1 connoisseur xd xr2 chip same as quest 2 should feel a lot more snappy pancake lenses significan notly smaller size and weight bigger sweet spot fewer god rays greater than 2160x2160 lcd displays so much more than quest 1 will see a lot of detail you could not see before wifi 6 support should be better for pc connectivity i understand that wired pcvr will be an option but wireless through virtual desktop will be preferable especially because it will allow you to play oculus pcvr games without revive one negative is that the headset is lcd not oled so black levels are a bit of an unknown for me but i am willing to take a gamble on it for the other benefits d edit i forgot the 90hz xd quest 1 can only do 72hz games should feel more fluid and real if you own a quest one it will be a night and day difference 2160x2160 resolution is noticably better connection to pc only via virtual desktop or a dongle that will be released next year there will be no cable connection think i heard somewhere usb c may follow bbut not sure first reviews say streaming with virtual desktop works very well however if you are into racing sims or flight sim you should wait for further reviews on latency for games like alyx i think there will be no issues except if you cannot accept some compression for the signal if you need cable this hmd is not for you unfortunately better tech that quest 1 better visuals you just gotta hand over your data to the chinese communist party anyone wanna tell me what is the reason people are afraid of it are people scared of it like they are scared of facebook and tik tok or am i missing something cause i ligit wanna get it because it lighter than the quest two wich means i do not have to buy a head strap on top of buying the headsetxd funny how oblivious these comments are most seem to think europe does not have the data protection act and also they think any useful data is extracted when you do not even have to login funny how ignorant people are when it comes to how data collection works it is even funnier if you think the ccp follows or cares about eu rules dude location data app data playtime times of use everything you click on and how long you stay there not having a log in means jack shit to having a user profile full of data about you exactly the device could have an unique hardware id like a mac address and that is more than enough for data collection and grouping people really out here thinking you can not build a user profile without a login sweet summer children research wouldevice fingerprinting to get an idea the day after i pre order via systemactive doh i also pre ordered through bestware amazon seems nicer due to 30 days return and maybe better handling of shipping however i believe it will arrive same day 1 so no reason to cancle and reorder over amazon i will not be canceling given the choice i would have ordered amazon tho to make use of my prime sub their logistics and avoid the risk of delay due to postal strikes or evri is incompetence and i have more confidence of amazon is return and replace being quick should i need it i am sure systemactive will be fine i have just no personal experience of their service amazon were not listed as resellers on pico is website yesterday same here im sure bestware is cool but would also have liked to stick with what i know i thought amazon orders would only be up after release ill have a sleep about it and maybe cancle at bestware lol nothing in the vr gaming world right now that could make me buy this i am wait for the next gen i have my rift cv1 quest1 and 2 quest 2s still good enough for a bit is this the one with no headphone jack headphones can be connected to the usb port via adapter not great but better than nothing xd yeah it is pico 4 what happened to pico 1 i have been really out of the loop sucked sucked ok and now the big jump thank you ordered and now to cancel it on bestware cheers everyone complaining in the comments about owning byte dance products as if they do not use tik tok i do not use tiktok reddit is enough on tiktok i saw only a constant flow of stupidity as someone who recently got one i can tell you why it is the cheapest headset for third world countries i had to import one from china and i live in brazil for the price of one single quest 2 you can get two pico 4 and you will still be left with some money to buy some games to give you some idea the quest 2 costs around 4 months of minimal salary the valve index costs more than a year honestly this is pretty interesting was pretty much the same in south africa quest use to be about 3 times msrp no support for quest in south africa so had to do via 3rd party bit the bullet and have had my quest for almost 2 years that is really sad the whole metaverse thing meta is trying to do will never happen if people can not put their hands on a headset i see a bright future for virtual reality but for that to happen it has to become more accessible i live in brazil and this kind of technology is reserved only for the riches at least for now i was lucky enough to buy the pico 4 from china without taxes which can be 60percent or more of the declared value i bought it so i can expand the kind of experiences i can develop at work and it is also much better hardware as someone who recently got one i can tell you why it is the best i troduction to vr hmds coming from the index it is just so much less work to make the setup run to position the hmd correctly to show other people to get no nausea to set the ipd to get into the sweet spot and you do not have a cable and access to 4 stores the pico the sidequest steam and android apps in general not sure if cardboard games run it just delivers the store needs some polish only a couple native games that use the resolution but when they do it looks great  i live in a third world country as well but pico 4 is roughly the same price as quest 2 if not slightly cheaper the price difference i can find is just as much as usdollar30 cheaper with limited availability and to import something like that is not an option here in germany the quest 2 is actually 25euros cheaper then the pico for real bruhhh i wasted 3 mil reales in my quest 2 through amazon brazil wow dude your country sucks prolly cause nothing else of note released based on the reviews i have seen of the product its not because its outstanding or anything its because its new pcvr is starved for a new headset if sony made psvr2 steamvr compatible i think we would see pretty high adoption rates on pc sony is probably selling the psvr2 at a loss standard for consoles they nearly always sell at a loss and make profit off games amp x200b that being said i am not sure how much there selling it at a loss for i would be fine paying dollar850 for a headset similar to the psvr2 on pc yea i would pay that for an oled 4k headset with eye tracking without even second guessing it gt sony is probably selling the psvr2 at a loss standard for consoles they nearly always sell at a loss and make profit off games sony does not do that they do not have to sony has been selling every ps4 at a profit for years they sell ever ps5 for a profit now the ps5 sold for a loss at the start but once the sales production chain smooths out they do not they have been selling the ps5 for a profit for over a year now they always sell for a loss at the start psvr2 is not out yet it will probably be selling for a loss in february so of course sony does that they do not aim to always sell it for a loss if you are selling for a loss it is hard to make it up in volume even facebook seems to have given up selling the quest 2 for a loss i am sure it is much cheaper to make and they jacked up the price by dollar100 gt they always sell for a loss at the start read my post you replied to and i went through all that also if you bothered to read the post i responded to that poster was just parroting the standard line that console makers sell consoles at a loss period not just at the start and make profit by selling games for example microsoft has to do that sony does not need to do that sony makes money on the consoles the games and the accessories yeah i noticed you completely contradicted yourself you said sony does not do that full stop the truth is they totally start every generation like that yeah i noticed that you do not know how to read full stop it is inevitable that we will get a new valve headset i mean they only run the only damn pcvr service besides what oculus for germany specifically it is the only low cost vr headset on the market wmrs rifts and quest1 went away some years ago g2 never got cheap and quest2 was never released in terms of price performance it is also the best headset on the market right now being both cheaper and better than the quest2 at least in terms of hardware software still needs a bit to catch up but that is not an issue when used for steamvr so people are basically using the pico 4 as an airlink type headset using it exclusively for pcvr where the software problems do not exist gotta say that doesnt seem like a terrible idea if the headset is good and light yes i use it like that would you say it is a noticeable improvement in experience over other headsets like the quest 2 or rifts or whatever i was an early adopter in vr with dk2 rift and quest 1 but the pico is by far the most comfortable one in terms of balance weight and it has a great visual clarity the facial cover was a little stiff at the beginning and the blacks could be way darker but all in all it was a big step up for me and for the price a no brainer that is how i use the q2 and vrdesktop is on pico as well wait what the quest 2 was never released in germany wow that explains why it is cheaper in brick and mortar stores than on amazon here austria do you know the reason and the reason 3rd party sellers did not take the opportunity to fill the lack in supply its because it is an upgrade in resolution and most importantly lens clarity at the edges form factor ergonomics at a cheap price pcvr owners looking for the next cheap upgrade are buying it it is below average in other areas compared to meta headsets like screen brightness software features store library that and there is nothing else lol you could call anything new the fastest growing that is a really loose wording that could mean so many different things my new headset sales are up 300percent since last week when i only sold 1 it could just be numbers of new purchases which just really means it is the only new cheaper thing selling now like you were saying pico 4 is an amazing pcvr headset easy to talk down something you have prolly never tried it has better visuals than reverb g2 and costs 450euros so it is a quite nice headset i only use my rift s for sim racing anymore for everything else pico 4 over vd and the freedom of movement is a big plus there gt it has better visuals than reverb g2 lol no i just picked up the the quest 2 resident evil bundle elite strap for gbp330 new if the pico 4 was cheaper i would have got that for sure only bought one as all the reviews kept telling me there was very little difference between the two headsets there are exclusives on the meta platform i wanted a pcvr headset that could be used totally free and with steam so i could play alyx and i kept being told the next big leap in steam compatible separate headset is over a year away at least and will cost more and with scalpers be stupidly hard to get also i have never tried vr before so if it is going to make me nauseous i want to find out before i pay a lot of cash i just wanted the cheapest way to play half life alyx and some stuff on steam i got from a humble bundle when valve bring out the next headset i will get one for sure but i want it to be pc and non pc the reviews are mixed because its hardware is brilliant 4k while still fast but it is hardware also brings it down games are unlikely to be optimised for the pico 4 because it is a lot of work this makes a lot of textures stretched and off all the way up to 0 67percent yeah but it is not counting anyone using virtual desktop yet now sure what the analysis is here the quest 2 achieved 41percent market share in 12 months it is fair to assume that it has reached a plateau and that any new headset that is not a complete flop should grow faster but there is fast and fast and those numbers actually look quite bad for the pico the pico took 0 5percent of the steam userbase in november the quest 2 lost 0 4percent at that rate it will take more than 40 months before the pico overtakes the quest 2 that is more than 3 years and meta has time to launch 1 or 2 new entry level headsets in that time on the other hand november is not usually a very fast month for purchasing toys and the us market is missing the figures for december and january will be more interesting the bit about virtual desktop is also interesting but it means that the numbers are basically useless so i am choosing to ignore it again future data will be more usable also wanted to note that the way i understand it guy godin developer of virtual desktop said that virtual desktop shows up under quest2 so people running the pico 4 with vd will show up under quest 2 in steam vr essentially giving it wrong statistics i might be wrong here i read something along that line yes that is what i understood too so until that is fixed the statistics are virtually useless i think it is really hard to make a clear analysis when the hmd is not even available in the us market but it is nice to see competitors are trying and got some success even in a limited range the pico 4 is a great product for it is price better value than quest 2 for sure in terms of hardware hardware good but i head everything but display port is dog shit connection wise i have had no problems once i got past apk region locks in fact using the virtual desktop app not native yet rofl the connection is more stable than oculus link the controllers recently got better tracking from a firmware update also now matching meta in reliability the headset is half the weight with a better fan and the lenses have 5mm intervals for pid adjustment further than even their published range meaning i no longer get motion sickness absolute game changer for me i am just talking visual quality as well as less nits not quite sure what you are referring to with visual quality unless comparing air link vs displayport same compression as the other air link and with nits man even 20percent brightness is plenty for me personally the quest i have lower than even that usually lol the nits have to do with how much light teachers the eyes and it is even lower than quest 2 and quest 2 can be low overall it is an ok product for what it is leaves a lot to be desired though good competition for meta is why i hope it does well he means that the pico 4 is not as bright as the quest 2 sounds like a paper spec low number bad my experience has been dramatically better in every way regarding the display and brightness has never been a thought maybe i need to compare side to side again side by side it is pretty clear that the quest is brighter the pico image kind of looks desaturated i think it is just a marketing campaign by pico do not forget who owns it lol accurate ipd adjustment by 5mm no fresnel distortion better fan half the weight less chromatic aberration cured my motion sickness and more than tripled my vr legs overnight vr gaming is now actually possible for me which legitimately could not happen on quest 2 limitations for longer than 30min well deserved currently the best value for pcvr it seems and so good to see some real alternatives in the market to prevent us all from getting locked into walled gardens i do not really see how pico is less of a walled garden than meta when connecting to a pc they both have no walls and when standalone they both have their store and they both support side loading yeah i never got this concept the quest and every oculus meta headset has always allowed you to connect to pc and use steamvr if you do not want to use oculus is store you do not have too that is why i have always thought the apple comparison was silly because meta actually allows you to download third party apps and use third party stores apple does not people want to complain about meta is data handling and privacy practices that is fine but also it is not like pico is not owned by a large chinese corporation that owns tik tok which has been known to share data to the chinese gov that is what is wild to me pico and meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults but people have embraced pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same i agree that it is stupid to go with the pico 4 if the reason you choose not to go quest is because of data and privacy issues they both equally suck ass in that department i think what got people going pico was that it is the closest quest competitor and does not require an account just to use pcvr now i still would not allow that device on my wifi network without seriously locking it down lol gt i think what got people going pico was that it is the closest quest competitor and does not require an account just to use pcvr that is the part that nearly got me to buy one yeh never gotten this issue i use native quest cable link and air link to play pc vr steam games via the official link program amazingly well with no issues on my quest pro additionally i can use virtual desktop if i wish to the oculus store is 100percent optional for tethered use where as every other pure tethered headset you require a pc the meta quest and pico are just better giving flexibility for solo and standalone options along with giving the same or better actual performance vive tracking is wank valve index res is bad every setup has downsides and upsides it all just seems like a big patch of sour grapes from people not wanting to pony up money for new headsets nevermind that the board of that company has many chinese govt officials on it so they can do whatever they want with our data if they chose to gt but also it is not like pico is not owned by a large chinese corporation that owns tik tok which has been known to share data to the chinese gov and us companies share data with the us government which is why europe ruled against meta on data privacy which is why the quest 2 is not sold in germany the pico is though gt that is what is wild to me pico and meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults but people have embraced pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same gt that is what is wild to me pico and meta are literally almost exactly the same when it comes to their faults but people have embraced pico whole still shitting on meta even though they are the same yes they are the same both us and chinese companies share data with their respective governments until meta accounts though pico had an advantage in that in does not know who you are they do not even ask for your name anonymity is generally good for privacy but with meta accounts you can now give them a fake name since positive id is not a requirement for a meta account well unless something goes wrong with your meta account and you need to recover then it will be tricky if you gave them a fake name with pico they never had your name to begin with gt yeah i never got this concept the quest and every oculus meta headset has always allowed you to connect to pc and use steamvr that is because you are not remembering it correctly oculus never made their headsets work with steam vr valve instead made steamvr work with oculus headsets just like virtual desktop made it possible for the quest headsets to stream pcvr and due to demand oculus meta eventually released airlink oculus has been attempting a closed ecosystem since day 1 of the oculus store but the community has been 1 step ahead of them every time i am remembering correctly because i have owned every oculus headset since the dk1 except the pro and worked in my colleges vrlab around the time that the vive was released for 2 years valve made the steamvr api compatible with oculus before the vive was even released literally like the week before the reason oculus had not done that yet at the time was because they were one of the only consumer vr options up until the vive outside of a couple open source headsets that were basically just copies of the dk2 that is not even taking into account the fact that up until the vive and then the oculus touch controllers no headset really offered motion controls outside of either modding pseye wands to work which i did in my colleges vrlab and it was not pretty or using the razer motion controllers i forget the specific name so yes valve made the highest selling consumer grade headset at the time compatible with their newer ecosystem it is not like that was not beneficial to valve at all also airlink had already been in development for awhile and it is not like oculus sent them a cease and desist and made them take down their application you can still use it oculus just made their own protocol after seeing people clamoring for it the only time that oculus really went the closed ecosystem route was by shutting down vive port which allowed steamvr headsets to use the oculus store gt so yes valve made the highest selling consumer grade headset at the time compatible with their newer ecosystem it is not like that was not beneficial to valve at all the highest selling consumer headset at that time was the htc vive rift launched with an xbox controller and as forward facing only experience it was essentially a joke until they introduced touch added support for more cameras and cut the price in half the whole rift launch was a complete rushed mess trying to play catch up with valve is new headset gt the only time that oculus really went the closed ecosystem route the issue is that oculus never had an official way to get third party headset into their ecosystem not back then not now you have to use hacks worse yet they can not even manage to support their very own headsets properly rift has always been locked out of venues quest1 got locked out of horizon go was abandoned and forgotten horizon is also still region locked to hell i recommend reading oculus facebook meta being a bit more locked down than the competition is no accident it is the whole point of them being into ar vr zuckerberg sees ar vr as the next big computing platform and he wants to control it which is something he failed to do in the smartphone space where google and apple control everything the only way he can fix that is by controlling whatever technology comes after smartphones i was referencing pre vive before the vive even launched they made the cv1 and previous oculus headsets compatible with steamvr at the time the cv1 was the highest selling consumer grade headset and yes they do not allow other headsets onto their platform they are taking the apple approach of closing off their own ecosystem which has it is benefits and detriments by turning people off to the platform the difference between them and apple is they do allow third party apps and allow their system to work in other ecosystems they are basically the same in that respect i actually think that facebook is doing a very good job for us all atm what i mean though is that attractive alternatives will prevent a platform to get too dominant and e g be able to limit usability of steam sidequest or other 3rd party platforms i agree i think accessible prices will allow for a better insertion into the market and exponentially motivate a larger amount of developers willing to contribute to the growth it seems to be a controversial opinion at the moment but personally i think meta is correct in regards of vr ar being the next step for gaming enterprises and social gathering it is a technology that has several different branches and that usually helps sedimentation 30 years ago no medium small company had a website and saw no need for it nowadays even my florist has a website i think metaverses are ought to go somewhere in some shape or form you said it right everyone likes to look back on the internet in the early 90s with rose colored glasses of course there were some good things about it but the majority thought it was useless and a waste of time why should i use email when we have a perfectly good postal service not a direct quote but you get the idea wall street also downplayed its significance before and after the dot com bubble denial hype cynicism we can see parallels between the present and back then there was the initial denial period of the tech even being possible we just went through the ar vr metaverse hype and bust and we are now in the cynical phase people always expect instant results on technological advancement it feels like the metaverse is what the internet was in 95 these things take time before we know it this tech will be everywhere and people will wonder what life was like before xr as a similar analogy to yours just 20 25 years ago when the first consoles were coming out you had to be either rich or lucky to have one the choice of hardware and software was very limited and having someone to play online was a pipe dream only a few years later consoles evolved into playstations xboxes nintendos etc the market was flooded with choice the prices were stable enough for mass adoption and of course it was fun nowadays everyone has some sort of a console in their homes the ball is rolling and like it or not meta is a billion dollar company who seems to be going all in into it so i am expecting at least a small impact on the medium long run i would not say they are jumping too early into it i think they are just paving and enlarging the path using their own corpses in hopes of reaping some dividends down the line but overall i think meta does know that this future is going to be shared with many other giants they are trying to sediment their layer as early as possible good point i think it is more about variety and not being at a mercy of a single company gt mercy of a single company valve is a single company just because you like the company does not change the fact that monopoly is still bad of course its not a binary case it depends on what we are talking about and in case of something like steam it may be quite different and yes i know that there are multiple companies making vr but in terms of cheap decent standalone vr until pico it was pretty much only oculus meta edit grammar gt i do not really see how pico is less of a walled garden than meta you can install apks straight from the main menu along with access to windows network shares basically they open the door for you to do your own stuff without their store you can do the same on quest but it is all well hidden they will not even allow you to use your headset without installing some spyware on your phone and until not too long ago facebook accounts used to be mandatory on pico you can just logout and forget about their online stuff remote management of pico devices also is better than quest which matters in business settings it is not like pico is some beacon of freedom but as far as android stuff goes it is reasonably open for now with meta you always have to worry about how they will fuck you over the next time as complete control of the platform is their main motivation for doing vr i cannot use my fucking oculus if i do not have a meta account how is that not less of a walled garden they are forcing me to make one or else my device that i paid for will be bricked you cannot use the pico 4 without creating a pico account bricked does not mean i did not log into the headset it means literally the headset is unusable i bought the headset there was none of that bullshit if i buy a bmw now and in 2 years they force me to make a bmw account to use my car will my car be bricked yes no it is not because you can create an account and it functions that is within the normal functioning of the device if something stopped all usage of the device i e phones that get bricked cannot start or go into a boot loop and this is not intended then it is bricked once again if the device or equipment stops functioning as intended it is bricked if you have to log into a free account it is not bricked you are just refusing to use the device which is your prerogative but saying it is bricked because you do not want to create an account is idiotic you need an account for steam for windows for your email hell you do need an account for new car features are these services bricked if i do not use them lmao or am i just refusing to use them and agree to their terms of service you have to make an account for practically every headset i do not see how that matters amp x200b want to use the index need a steam account want to use a pico have to make a pico account just making an account is not that big of a deal anyway amp x200b most things require you to make an account to use them now including phones even windows heavily pushes you to make one it is a good value compared to the quest pro since it also has pancake lenses and higher ppd for significan notly less dollar regardless the pico 4 like the quest pro is not true a pcvr headset quest and pico are currently the best ways into wireless pcvr i have done tons of tests comparing quest do not have a pico yet to a vive wigig wireless adapter the vive beats out the quest ten fold when it comes to latency compression and gaming performance it is a cheap way to use wireless pcvr for sure but it is not the best that is not saying i recommend most people get a vive there is a lot of negatives with it but the wigig adapter is significan notly better than wifi for short range data transfer seconded plus it is native steamvr i get to use any lighthouse tracked device i want tbh i think its time for valve to ditch lighthouse tracking because tracking without external accessories is already a thing that even psvr2 has adopted it saves hardware manufacturing cost and performance has met the standard for average consumers inside out tracking does not meet that standards need to build future vr games in every situation though touch pads are also good enough for average consumers but pc gamers use gaming mice pc games are built on top of a foundation of solid high performance hardware and pc vr games of the future need the same foundation of high performance hardware even if you personally chose to use inside out tracking you should be happy that steam vr lighthouse tracking exists and sets the bar high you really are not helping anyone other than companies who want to make low end hardware by arguing against lighthouse tracking what is wrong with having options yeah i meant the whole package i am not sure quest or pico even excel in a single individual performance subcategory it is how they bring it all together in a usable way at an attractive price what is your router setup because that is what makes a world is of difference a proper high bandwidth wifi 6 ax router will work almost identically to a vive adapter a lot of people who have issues with latency and compression on airlink have an outdated router not having the host pc hardwired into the router or the router is not in the same room as the hmd it is not i have a high end wifi6 router i have done numerous performance tests with recorded footage i hate to break it to you but quest pico over wifi including the d link airbridge which i tested as well and own is not anywhere close to the wigig adapter wigig can seamlessly transfer 7gbs of uplink this virtually means 0 latency 0 compression and performance is the exact same as a wired connection e g index level of visuals and performance but wireless wifi had a max uplink speed of 100mbs but even that is not stable and majority is 20 50 even on a high end wifi setup what this means is compression latency and performance issues you can see in practical use by playing apps with tons of moving parts or stuff on the screen test it out in a game like tales of glory on steamvr and crank the units on screen to 200 400 your quest will be a blurry mess a vive running wireless over wigig with have a clear picture and be identical to a wired setup i mean no hate towards the quest for the price it it is pretty decent but a vive wireless costs 3x more and you will get a 10x better pcvr wireless experience it is not just an opinion it is in indisputable fact and i can provide the video footage with the performance and latency benchmarks to back this up there are downsides though which is why this is really only good for people who are into high end vr or streamers you need to be ok with some technical hiccups the vive is lower rez although i used the pro eye with oled which had better colors imho and sometimes the wigig runs into some glitches and it will black out and get a grey screen adapter also needs to be able to see the receiver which means you are semi limited in a room you can use it in and it is also really expensive you could probably buy an entire pc quest just for the price of the headset and adapter when it does work it is fantastic though virtual desktop streaming is not true pcvr that is some elitist bs so when i am playing alyx on vd with my quest2 it is not vr got it laughs in my 4090 vd pico setup it is the best pcvr experience i have had thanks to wireless comfort how hard to run steam pc on the pico do i need to buy anything else a good router that supports wifi 6 and ofc a decent gpu pretty silly gatekeeping it is a balance of pros and cons honestly does a pico 4 or quest 2 over vd have the same fidelity as an index or g2 no of course not but the tradeoff is you get a full untethered experience and can getup and go playing something with far less preparation and delay i can go from putting my quest 2 on to playing something within a minute or so as long as your wireless router or hotspot is in the same room the latency should be good enough to never be distracting i would define pcvr as running pc vr apps and not limit that to a particular way of translating information into an image that does not have a future anyways given the popularity of wireless vr what other headset do you own other than your quest none it is not native pcvr but still pcvr nonetheless just because it does not have a displayport connection does not mean that it is not a true pcvr headset amp x200b despite them not having displayport they are still better than a lot of true pcvr headsets out there for pcvr gt despite them not having displayport they are still better than a lot of true pcvr headsets out there for pcvr the o with an oled display is better than the q2 for some dark games i literally can not see a thing through the muddy grey mess of the q2 i can with a o also there is latency which should be self explanatory the lag doing wireless pcvr is noticeable it is not sold here in turkey owning a pico 4 for some time now it really is a great product great price best value sure it is bitedance but u do not have to have an account to run it i am not into standalone features for me pcvr is the holy grail and the pico 4 is on the job like a maxo 5 easily the best overall pcvr headset today a moderator in skyrim vr sub reddit author of the popular wabbajack who had an index and pro 2 called it the best image quality for modded skyrim he ever seen and it is wireless i hope quest 3 will at least match it oculus market share dominance still means far better support from developers no really a new headset that did not exist before has its steam number grow quickly amazing s and it grew all the way to 0 46percent double amazing s can not wait until they update the data to propely show the quest pro i assume it is part of the 1 38percent other category that is great the more vr users the better never heard of it until now but i am glad more alternatives are becoming available as i have already had my quest 2 for a year and i doubt this thing is going to last more than more than 2 years or so before i need something new would this be a good upgrade from the vive 1st gen absolutely can it play everything my vive can i know the quest can not handle like half of my games the quest can handle all your games you just need to connect it to pcvr same with the pico amp x200b if you use it in stand alone mode then it can not because your games are on steam and standalone can not run steam but if you connect it to your pc either through wifi or usb then you can play the pc games you own although the title is correct the market is dominated by oculus by a wide wide margin 2160x2160 pancake lenses color passthrought standalone and pcvr also wireless cheaper than others cool controllers with a powerbank i can get 12 15h of battery life while playing so more than enough this is still just steam vr and not standalone curious how they are doing overall did not they say a few weeks ago that they are having disappointing sales because they expected to sell 1m units in a stupid timespan they sold less than they expected in china as far as i can remember the customers are probably out protesting instead of buying vr headsets there is also a ton of choice in china this is what most people in this sub do not get in china there are a lot more options than in the us if they are referring to western sales then it is no surprise since there was fuck all stock available and very few retailers stocking them oh and also a late release date because of that a large portion of the vr community probably lives in the us and you can not actually buy a pico officially in north america which probably has a pretty big negative impact on sales maybe this is the first headset ever to properly register on steam apart from their own the survey always comes up for me it is never even once detected my rift s or hp reverb it is because the hardware survey that runs for normal hardware collection is not what is used to gather data on vr headsets due to it being very unreliable they use a metric added in steamvr that shows the headsets used in the last 30 days if you use an index and a vive pro both will show up in the survey if you do not use any headset for 30 days it will drop off of the survey even if you leave it plugged in they have been doing it that way for a few years now that is very interesting tbh i have always wondered how it works with wireless headsets like the quest and pico since those are not always connected and afaik it just picks a single random time to do the sample can not be surprised i sold my quest 2 a day after i bought the pico 4 great headset does the pico 4 fix the weight comfort issues with the quest 2 that is the biggest issue for me so bad that it affects immersion yes i bought an aftermarket strap for my quest 2 i have like 4 of them the comfort of p4 is a lot better even when my q2 had the elite strap too bad it kind of sucks and we are just so eager to replace meta we would rather go with the ccp crazy to me meta sucks i know but it is a great product and i would rather have it than pico there is swim issues the cpu gpu are constantly running at max level their streaming performance is atrocious compared to airlink etc  people just really hate facebook meta for some reason amp x200b i agree that collecting data is a bad thing overall and it can be a reason to buy one headset over the other amp x200b but if you are someone who uses amazon google or other social medias on a regular basis then it is cherry picking to complain about meta is data considering that same data is already being collected and sold quite literally any website that warns you about the type of cookies they collect is collecting more data than they need and that is why the meta hate is overblown if you hate meta for that reason you hate most other tech companies out there btw most of is collected for big data analysis rather than having specific info on a person gt meta is data considering that same data is already being collected and sold it is not the same when has amazon gathered people is tax return financial data meta has  you would rather the chinese government have that information to further target and sow dissent in groups  meta has yes had some pretty serious scandals in the past but by and large seem to be taking privacy and security pretty seriously on the vr side of things i mean they even removed a depth sensor over concerns in the pro can you name a privacy violation or security leak that is occurred from meta is vr products any evidence they are selling or handing over data because you can be damn sure pico bytedance as a ccp owned company is doing exactly that i do not live in china what can they do to me nothing i live in the us what can the us government do to me everything also pico does not know who you are they do not even ask for your name it is hard to target anonymous people that is why vpns work most western companies do not kill people that disagree with them and make whole families disapear lol are you sure about that besides china has a lot of stuff that can be fairly criticized but there is also a lot of anti china propaganda being spewed around in our beloved western countries and assassinating political dissidents is one of those i know what is bad and that is both of them i do not want either on my system unless they can run independently as hardware qq though with sidequest does that mean that you no longer need anything meta drivers oculus login etc to use the hardware to play games or pcvr people are not stupid they are just easily swayed into stupid combative groups just like politics people buy chinese handheld devices all the time now it is jumping in bed with the ccp or is that just the official meta company line you are quoting or maybe that we are pointing out the ignorant hypocrisy there is no hypocrisy people like tik tok and they do not like facebook it is really that simple yeah i am just going to pick up a quest 3 whenever it comes out interested in what valve comes up with but if it is priced like the index not sure i will be able to financially justify it yah spending dollar1k on a vr headset is just a lot for most people especially considering when a headset half the price is nearly as good amp x200b a lot of people do not seem to understand value whenever someone asks if they should get a quest 2 there is always someone jumping in telling them to buy a vive pro or wait for the pimax crystal instead you are being downvoted and you should not be tbh with lack of us availability i am betting resell value will remain relatively stable where i am til we know a release for the quest 3 i will flip it to an enthusiast and swap out your info is out of date there is been updates to optimise cpu gpu power usage see the release notes from pico 4 is updates it is worth noting that going for the third party streaming virtual desktop on pico 4 version offers better streaming quality than on quest 2 still does not deal with swim and image wobble issues i have had zero swim or wobble perhaps check if your router is truly optimal for the purpose with zero other devices on the 5g frequency band same issue with quest link i do not mean streaming just the image in general in standalone it has weird issues sounds like your headset has defects which is the main reason i believe people should not buy it if they live in the us since it makes it a pain to return and there quality control kind of sucks i agree but to be fair this issue was mentioned in the uploadvr articles too pico has pretty bad quality control and a lot of people ended up getting lenses with defects pcvr using virtual desktop is amazing no vendor lock in and stream whatever your desktop laptop can render yea no vendor lock in except you know for valve what system has a vendor lock in playstation vr we are talking about pcvr systems here not console vr since you bring up playstation vr you should know that pc drivers exist for it to be used in steam vr as well to be fair every app store tries to lock contain you within their ecosystem including steam but i prefer steam store vs pico or oculus stores you can use steam on any of the currently available headsets including those from pico and meta i love mine well deserved in my book good to see having used the pico 3 eye an really disappointing by pico seems like a really prototype product the software is a bit prototype feeling issues and the face cover was not designed for western face shapes it seems those are the two obvious issues imo oh and no dp over usb c but i hear that was done deliberately to make pcvr less interesting for customers since they do not make money selling steam games i wish we would get a vr hmd co that does not think in such anti consumer ways gt make pcvr less interesting for customers since they do not make money selling steam games they failed atleast partially would probably be more popular if it did have dp over usb c i do not think they care about how popular their headset is if they can not make more money off of it and i am confident most of the people who bought the pico 4 are not interested in standalone games gt i am confident most of the people who bought the pico 4 are not interested in standalone games i can only speak for myself but i would be interested in them if they all had a unified store so i do not have to lock myself in a one echo system i would assume sidequest allows for this but there are not much games for pico there yet if they supported dp they would probably need to sell the headset at a higher price from what i have read they are losing 140dollar per headset in the hope of making that money back from games sales however i am sure there is a good number of people who would be willing to shell out a little bit more for a pico 4 link with displayport look up the pimax crystal it will offer wireless vr but also has displayport connection and that s a good thing oculus with it s walled garden is waaay to dangerous this is steamvr what walls are you talking about indeed with virtual desktop and the pico assistant we can jump it s limitations and you can not do that with a quest gt and the pico assistant good luck with that lol and bytedance is not o o seriously so many ignorant posts here pico ecosystem is barely different from quest yet you get people acting like the product coming from bytedance is the most open one lol compared to oculus no how what does a walled garden mean anymore it is not just a word you use to describe a company you are conditioned to hate bytedance owns tik tok and has been known to share data with the chinese government how is that any better than meta yeah the ccp is way better this link has been shared 1 time first seen on 2022 12 06 scope reddit check title false max age none searched links 0 search time 0 0s price aside is the valve index the best vr pc gaming experience or does it have some real negative things about it aside from beeing non wireless compared to all the other pc vr is out there oh so everyone has money now jk i am sticking to valve index until it expires on my living room floor i did just get a katwalk c tho need to build it not in the us amazon uk quest will be at the top again in nearly 3 weeks christmas noobs not hard when starting from zero it is bc everyone who bought it has to use pcvr since there is such a small game catalog lmak they are not even at half a percent though it does say they have not released it to na so that is good for just being europe japan and south korea wonder how many of those oculus losses are to this i would love a chart showing what people switch to from when you click one of them if they had displayport i would have considered buying one people even trust china facebook more than suckerberg says a lot lol facebook is and pico is vr hardware base os all come from china the company is goertek they invented the android based wireless vr devices and all vr brands with the same setup are based on goertek is reference design and manufacturing here in korea not a third world country the pico 4 is only about dollar100 cheaper than the quest 2 definitely not double wait until microoleds hit market lol how easy is it to play steamvr games wirelessly been thinking between quest 2 and this also one option is wait for new headsets coming in 2023 i am currently on lenovo explorer and i play sim racing games immersion is fine but would like decent upgrade for clarity and possibility to go wireless using virtual desktop the setup is identical quest 2 and easy it is not dollar3000 after all it is dollar3499 i would thought there was a fair chance they would let rumours of dollar3 000 spread so they could surprise everyone with a price that was dollar500 different looks like i was right but in the wrong direction same thing with the release date let everyone think december and then surprise them with october november nope surprise them with january february only for the us lmao same here man i feel like they did not need to be so expensive they went a bit overboard with the processing power looks like apple wanted to fix absolutely everything from comfort to motion sickness etc etc they do not care if it initially sells poorly they wanted the experience to be immaculate and on brand yup this is a halo product that will push the innovation in the market and hopefully in a few years they will release a lower end set with mostly the same features for a relatively cheap dollar1000    a cell phone is often people is most used possession if you are gonna splurge on anything might as well be a cell phone they wanted to fix comfort so they made an elastic head strap with no top strap that will result in all of the pressure being on your face i have seen at least one press photo with a top strap shown so looks like it is an option removable headstrap too apple is 3rd party accessory providers are about to go wild makes sense why meta announced theirs at dollar499 right before honestly i think zuck is probably kicking himself for doing the meta showcase and quest 3 reveal before apple is event in the wake of all the shock and social media hysteria about apple is high priced ar headset it would have been the perfect time to unveil a 500 dollar vr headset for gaming starting at more memory more cost do not forget the battery and prescription lenses for a lot of people probably dollar300 on top reloptix are dollar90 for meta quest pro so the zeiss optical inserts could be dollar200 100 i assume you could go third party for the prescription lenses pretty easily since there is no software for that rip my always more expensive high index lense requirements spits out coffee dollar3500 for a snorkeling mask i for one am glad we finally got to the ski goggles form factor from the og rift kickstarter i am kind of surprised it is not more expensive considering it is basically an ar enabled macbook presuming you can upgrade things like ram storage i would not be at all surprised if dollar3500 is just the starting price for the headset i wonder if they themselves laughed at this price they must be aware how ridiculous this price is the pro tag is usually used for their high end devices so theyre expecting to be able to produce a model thats more consumer targeted in the future is my guess the guy had to name the things you have to buy to even match what that headset could do like buying high res tv surround system and a computer and can not deliver what the headset could deliver it is a lame comparison tbh because if i have tv surround and computer multiple people could use these devices same time but tell me how much i need to buy everyone in my family a headset so we can enjoy watching a movie together in the spatial world lol lol i thought that was a pretty lame sales tactic and was a little surprised they would go there it was almost like they were helping me craft an argument for my spouse that this was not in fact a ridiculous purchase i also use my tv to play ps5 and switch that is not even possible with the headset sell the family and then you do not need a tv yea i am definitely not going to be able to get it lol dollar3k was the limit for me sadly even if you could afford it why what can this thing do that is worth 3k at this point it is a developer device they need to build up their ecosystem first to compete with meta wait for a year or two and they should have a cheaper mass consumer version out i agree i think they want to iron out the gesture controls and see how early adopters feel in general and what needs tuning it is like the first ipad devs and apple enthusiasts get to run the public beta two years after they launch vision pro 2 and vision se hopefully having a handful of actual game titles to sell as a developer let me explain why this is not that bad of a deal but yes it is not a product for vr gamers 1 they mentioned using xcode and 3d creation drafting rendering but they did not mention it needing to be tethered to a macbook 2 it has 3d cameras and lidar basically it has not just a high quality camera built in but one that can scan 3d objects xcode is the ide for developing ios and mac apps as of now it can not be used on an ipad not even the pro it is a very heavy application it also has the ability to run an ios simulator for testing applications this headset has the computational and rendering power of an entire m2 macbook built into it the m2 macbook is already a dollar1500 device and that device does not come with 3d scanning cameras so the ar headset aspect of this is really about dollar2000 xcode could easily run on the ipad pro this is just a design decision by apple gt it has 3d cameras and lidar basically it has not just a high quality camera built in but one that can scan 3d objects will that scanning work better than what lidar does on ipad pro because frankly the one on ipad does a terrible job and people get better results with just series of photos alone that i get with lidar it is a spatial computer as they say it is not a side thing it is the main thing and it can also serve as a pseudo pro screen for your devices starts at dollar3499 starts at want another 8gb of ram and another 256gb of storage that price will be closer to 5k turns out 4k per eye was the price this is too good lol they clearly believe in it but 3499dollar is a lot yeah given how well 1 5k questpro did it is a tough price tag to swallow granted apple has a different level of consumers but still they paint it as an everyday device for students and normal folks so they must count on at least some units being moved if they sell this they will sell it to rich people who were not interested in vr until this moment it will be for the wow factor at the beginning and it has a really strong wow factor at least for this first wave of these devices i do not think it will be bought with the utility in mind because let is be honest it does not do anything that you cannot do in a less cool much more affordable way at the moment however if they can get it in enough influencers hands and establish a feeling of exclusivity for the experiences that you can only have with it e g 3d facetime or what do they call it and lower the price for the second wave maybe they can break into the larger market we will see i suppose personally i do not have that kind of money laying around but i want it to succeed because i want more less expensive devices like this that cater also to my gamer is needs gt and lower the price for the second wave that is what i was thinking given that they opened with pro version probbly because like you said they wanted to max out on wowness of it there maybe will be a regular version later not as fancy but also not as pricey there have been rumors for the last few years that they will come out with a lower cost more casual set of ar glasses more akin to google glass they could easily be setting up for an apple vision pro apple vision and apple lt glass gt lineup for their new spatial computing platform i think you are right that they are starting here for wow factor so that they have people is attention as the lineup moves down market spatial computing is such an apple term agreed this is not a consumer product this is like when honda builds a racecar so they can attract innovative engineers and use lessons learned in the year is civic gt if they sell this they will sell it to rich people who were not interested in vr until this moment it will be for the wow factor at the beginning and it has a really strong wow factor which is essentially what apple did with the original mac it too was expensive dollar2500 but that was in 1984 dollars which is about dollar7000 in 2022 dollars they really said we ai not losing a dime on this when i was thinking they would sell it at least dollar2 5k omg that external screen is 3d like how autostereoscopic devices work with a lenticular lens someone looking at you sees the correct perspective depending on what angle they are looking at you from i feel like a lot of the engineering must have gone into this thing alone and i am not so sure people will actually use it this feels like the first feature to get dropped once generation 2 comes out it looks impressive but it will be dead weight 99percent of the time i do not expect people to walk around with this thing in public  it is also super distinctive like the iphone notch now dynamic island the shape of airpods in your ear and the shape of an apple watch it gives it its distinctive look and i would be utterly shocked if it does not stay around for a very long time have been using and owning vr headsets since the oculus dk1 and i reckon this makes a lot of sense you might as well be on another planet with most headsets and it is just not practical for a lot of people a lot of the time nerds like me might be happy with pass through but hey using your own eyes is much much better edit i am an idiot people it does not work like that it is not your own eyes it is passthrough cameras and it projects a 3d image of your face on the other side it will not get dropped from the flagship but it will for vision se which will be dollar1500 and seem like a deal i do not think it will even get dropped from the se this is the secret sauce at this point i fully agree with charlie nosuf above this is the only way people will stop looking at vr as an anti social experience this is truly great for the future of vr mr xr it is essential to making it an augmented reality device in the sense that people may actually want to be around you while you are wearing it gt people may actually want to be around you let is not ask the impossible here for just 3500dollar people might actually want to be around you if i had dollar3500 to blow itd be on making people want to be around me in other ways like therapy or cocaine i am kinda curious how this will actually look lenticular lenses are cool because they allow passive glasses less 3d but there is a massive tradeoff with resolution since you need to provide a separate set of pixels for each perspective if they took an normal iphone display and used a lens with 10 different perspectives the effective resolution would only be somewhere around 360p i also found it a bit weird how dim it looked in all their shots probably just to preserve battery life but still would not have expected that in marketing material low resolution might be exactly why the lenticular display looks dim my other thought was maybe the effect was a little creepy and looked off enough that making it dimmer hid some of the uncanny valley ness to it yep definitely this plus makes it more like sunglasses which people used to too clear would be pretty obvious display but this gives subtle ques to outside viewer where your looking plus low resolution not issue because your going to be looking at it from a distance yeah this was rumored to be how it would work and i actually love it a lot my hot take is that this feature is worth the wasted power weight in order to make this headset the kind of product apple wants to position it as given how antisocial vr feels and how careful apple is with design i would not be surprised if it actually really helps right for vr i am not positive of how useful it will be but for ar this will make it way less weird because you will actually be able to know if someone can see you or not i thought it was pretty clever that and that it can mix in a person that comes into the room verge writer gasped when he started to talk to someone while wearing it and they appeared in the space he was watching a movie in agreed i have seen a lot of criticism of it but i thought it was awesome a very apple touch to put so much work into something that is kind of useless but they know will make the product a lot more palatable it will make me feel a lot more comfortable wearing it with people around if they can see my eyes it is a ready player one inspired headset my bad girl i was not actually looking at your tits i was just simply looking for a way to get rid of this candy crush notification touches tits sorry ma am i thought you were virtual awkwardly itll show your eyes when people are present so if she sees your eyes she is gonna know just wear sunglasses under the headset from the comments here i do not know why people expected apple to make a vr gaming headset apple product are lifestyle and productivity and this thing a least tech wise looks like the next generation for that categories the price tho is pretty immense 3499dollar is alot costs way more that macbooks does the vision pro have justifications over just buying a macbook and work with a external second monitor guess its up for the developers if this thing finds its way to main stream from the demo it appears that it will work as a 2nd monitor for your mac or at least a projection of your mac is screen from my pov this is not a huge selling point given the battery limitations and the true resolution would fall beneath what you get irl from a 5k display i have been using the varjo aero to watch movies and surf youtube websites for awhile now and after experiencing a 200 ft virtual screen for my desktop i willingly trade the bulky hmd over traditional 5k monitors not to mention apple is claiming they are able to project virtual desktops all around you that is the one feature i am most excited about and if they are able to integrate hand tracking gestures seamlessly with voice commands i am more than ready to reenact minority report from the comfort of my couch wearing nothing but my birthday suit 23 mio pixels is a square resolution of 3400x3400 per eye which is much higher than the very next best headset at 2880x2880 that custom lenses also look hq i am sure this will be finally enough to read text sharp and clearly sure its not like a retina lcd but close micro oled edge to edge clarity lenses wonder what the fov is though   i am just happy they actually used real terminology for the displays instead of calling them something stupid like micro retina displays i was waiting for the slideshow to reveal the more field of view than other things  there is nothing for apple to compare their device to anyway as if you saw the reveal they invented everything bro they had to explain what ar is in the video so normies understand what the device even does they are not going to talk about fov  apple has dropped plenty of techie specs in the past remember the introduction of retina  live update on specs here starting at dollar3499 yikes really great demo though i want one sigh sells car funny name for a kidney d good that they mentioned that apple stores will allow demos i wont ever buy one but i certainly want to try one same well other companies are bound to make their own versions soon enough so i can not wait to get something like it in the next 5 10 years it has a macbook built into it basically the cheapest xcode capable device you can buy is dollar1000 dollar1400 but since it is an m2 you would have to start from m2 capable macbooks add in the ar capabilities 3d camera capabilities the price is not bad but you get a lot of stuff you might not need if all you wanted was vr experiences i am surprised no one has mentioned the tether it looks like it goes into a puck in a pocket it is an external battery pack that goes in your pocket lasts up to 2 hours ah nice now apple can burn a hole in my pocket twice they gave it an external battery that can not even power it long enough to watch a movie on the apps they presented for this price yikes i mean you could buy a swap batter for the low low price of dollar999 or dollar1999 should you want that battery on fancy wheels d xd good point i remember reading something confirming that their battery has a proprietary connector you can also plug it in when you are not walking around like the wall it is clearly a compromise they needed to do but are not happy about also notice how tim cook announced it as ar headset he is not a fan of vr he does not even want to mention it not even mixed reality yeah the entire thing has been very ar focused the only mention of vr is environments and even then they did not want to really emphasize it can be all encompassing and yet they continuously do with environments it is all pretty clearly trying to get people not to ask about quest store or steam vr they have also never used the word game they did at the end you can play games on your augmented flat screen with your ps5 controller they also name dropped unity games and software they are avoiding talking about any competition in the vr space very intentionally they want their developers to make games but they do not want laypeople to start looking at what they can get with a quest or pcvr for far less money if they do not already know they absolutely but they never said virtual reality or 3d games it was play existing apple arcade games and they even showed the person using a game controller i think it was a ps5 controller but i am not 100percent sure later in the presentation they did specifically for games but they never said vr gaming i mean even just attempting to reinvent ar as spacial computing is absolutely ridiculous but it is apple so maybe that explains why they did not demonstrate anything that was really vr they showed gaming on a giant virtual screen but no vr games at all which for an incredible looking bit of hardware was really odd pinch to zoom but without a controller so cool this headset seems so good at making you feel like you are not wearing a headset but does not seem to do much to make you feel like you are in virtual reality and that saddens me greatly video for anyone that missed the keynote that pixel count reveal was very interesting if it truly looks crystal clear in the headset then this will be the future that said at that price i suspect it will be v2 or v3 before true mainstream support i suspect apple knows this as well they named it pro for that reason imo very impressive tech but i wonder who the customer segment actually is i have some thoughts that i have not seen others talk about good a technical marvel that from a technical perspective will blow its mainstream competition away more powerful than any other standalone headset very high resolution and display quality excellent build quality excellent hand amp eye tracking knowing apple the audio will be good iris scanning etc user interface looks very polished access to apple is ios and mac ecosystem from day one is a huge advantage over the quest pro add onto that apple is experience in the prosumer space external battery pack i expect many will disagree with me here but i think having the battery be external allows you to not front load the devices weighting switch out batteries when one dies and connect to power directly without still carrying that battery weight works with bt keyboard and mice absolute win for productivity will depend on how good the passthrough quality is but given how much of a focus apple has had on this being for mr it should be great right the focus on 2d amp traditional applications gives me hope that they will be the first one to get the productivity side of vr mr right mixed hand tracking do not get me wrong if any company can nail the hand tracking ux it is apple but that fact that this is not out till next year and we did not get any live demo of the hand tracking is concerning the strap a simple front loaded mount with a strap that compresses it to your face given this is a productivity device surely a more ergonomic halo strap would have been better for long session comfortability i hope this is not a case of apple choosing form over function moving the battery external should help but its competitors use plastic not glass and metal so we will see battery life seems short but given external battery probably not that big of a deal voice control reliance on voice control especially for typing text has me worried how this device will perform for non english speakers or those with a thick accent but keyboard connectivity and hand tracking exist so probably fine either way the price the price is absurd i can see an argument for its replacing your computer tablet tv monitor etc all in one device so it is actually cheaper or its a dev kit for developers and early adopters a cheaper device is coming in a year or two though it is apple and they are marketing masters so they can probably still ship it concerns no optional controllers seems like a lost opportunity in the vr mr industry gaming is the biggest sector by far right now now hardcore gaming is not apple is expertise but still most of the successful vr games right now are arcade y style games that would gel with apple is vibe very well had a quick peek at the limited information on the sdk and the unity support and it looks to me that the tools to build great games will exist if optional controllers existed then you could also let valve pcvr developers do the heavy lifting porting more hardcore vr games to macos no mention of fitness applications probably the second biggest vr software market right now and one that is right up apple is alley apple watch mindfulness vr app etc i was a bit surprised i really expected apple to double down after the mindfulness reveal sell the apple vision pro as a lifestyle some of the current vr workout apps are great so it is kind of a weird exclusion although i expect third party developers will cook something up got me a worried that the strap is not that tight and will not stay on during activity some additional thoughts i would not be surprised if apple has a limit on how close to your eyes objects are allowed to get vergence accommodation conflict is very immersion breaking and i could see apple hyper focusing the ux could explain their focus on 2d applications i wonder if each of the mainstream players will stake out a different section of the vr market sony in the medium high end gaming market quest at the low end mass market approach apple in the high end productivity space etc all with a different approach till either vr mr dies out or it becomes more mainstream if this can replace my laptop two additional monitors mic speakers webcam quest 2 mouse and keyboard while also giving me more displays ar integration and let me continue to work from home it could be worth that price tag but it would require all my current tech to no longer work just justify the replacement and it would have to be as powerful as my laptop i will watch vision pro is career with great interest that scene of the dude watching his kids play with the headset on was so dystopian looking straight out of black mirror like play with your kid take off the headset literally exactly the same as that scene in minority report where tom cruise watches a 3d video of his dead son life imitates art i mean that is the point no he can still see and interact with people with the headset on no different than him watching them with the tv on or with a phone in hand or both i think it would be great to relive memories from many years ago only euros3499 99 yep the device is amazing but the price is meh although they say the quality and experience blows out of the water any high end tv and sound system let is see no way the tiny speakers even come close to a proper av system especially in the low end of the frequency range yes if you live alone what about your so or family members they can look at your awesome representation of a face on the headset dad where is all of our money and what is on your head dials the crown all the way for immersion i can not see you honey not right now d speaking of family lol that scene where they presented taking 3d video and pictures was funny as hell they did not show it but there was a dad in a f ing gogles at his doughters birthday imagine his wife being like not this shit again steven you were supposed to return them xd xd xd so if this is spatial computing why is everything on 2d surfaces feel they could have built a lot more genuine volumetric 3d apps with avatars etc finally someone is noticing all these headsets still have 2d interfaces x and y maybe it will take a while to evolve design with depth in mind because that would require developing new apps and considering the size of the usebase at that pricepoint nobody is going to be developing new apps specifically for this device it has the same issues as current vr gamedev low install base low profits lack of development but even worse i think apple have realised that and wisely and very honestly focussed on projecting existing apps on 2d surfaces i am honestly really surprised by the negative reaction on this subreddit the attention to detail and hardware innovations that were shown in the presentation are astonishing we should be trying to support the adoption of vr here even if it does not deliver on the hype this headset has achieved huge milestones that i have been waiting to hear about for years regardless of cost at least apple used all of its resources at its disposal to make the strongest push in the history of this industry to make a headset that alone is commendable the price is my only negative reaction the lack of good vr gaming was expected the displays sensors audio and overall hardware design are very impressive to me agreed i am a pretty apple y person and am turned off by the vision pro after mulling it over for a bit it is clear they are positioning it as a springboard for visionos and a world where the tight control they exert over the app store remains intact that is fine for a mobile device but for a dollar3500 pro device is unacceptable and really eliminates all the attractive edge cases that make expensive vr setups worth the effort my gut tells me apple will not win this generation of devices in the near term anyways because they can not see beyond their own business case to create something that advocates for the platform itself or put it another way ios and the app store unlocked the potential of smartphones and made things easier for most consumers the same does not appear to be true of visionos apple is essentially entering the vr headset market where it will eventually be outpriced by hungrier competitors who are not shackled by the need to service a app store model i am not an apple user so i am curious for your opinion do you think apple may be seeing this as complementary a straight up portable replacement to the mac ecosystem i am not sure how much of a tight control apple has over the mac ecosystem especially vs ios but with recent trends being to merge the two correct me if i am wrong it seems like visionos may eventually go the same way if they can snag developers into the visionos ecosystem and get industry favoured apps for specific workflows a final cut esque thing then i can see apple gaining a lot of ground in the xr space just by being the thing companies need to buy into again this is a gigantic what if scenario because strapping goggles to your head for extended periods of time remains a huge physical barrier that goes way beyond wearing something on your wrist i think apple sees this as another way to interact with what is becoming a platform agnostic blob of applications that are able to function across different surfaces this surface happens to be the experimental bleeding edge with the potential to be a dud or take over the world i could see an outcome where apple does this right and we are all editing videos in a minority report like environment but for this type of workflow to be truly productive it requires apple to allow visionos software to do things that it is not wholly comfortable with ios accomplishing the jury is way way out i think apple would love it if we ignored most of the complex heady stuff completely and were content with simply consuming media simple visionos exclusive apps and simple things like imessage hangouts etc i think apple definitely sees this as the future of consumer desktop computing the mac laptops will basically just be terminals for the ar ecosystem and i personally think this is the killer use case when microsoft announced hololens despite all its flaws i thought this was the direction they were going apple showed basically what i have always envisioned for vr early reviews by people demoing them including apple skeptics like mkbhd are pretty stellar imagine two moores law cycles when the devices are 1 4 as small or 1 4 the price and apple has a winner imo as a small time filmmaker i am interested in the camera technology involved apple makes great cameras as seen in how easy it is to have great photo and video with the thing in your pocket i like the idea of a first person perspective to be used for documentaries or for specialized shots in short films this is a gaming sub that does not want to spend 3500 on a device that does not really game this is not r vrgaming though it is a sub for all things virtual reality it does a better job presenting itself as a multi faceted device for professionals than the quest pro did the differences between the presentation and marketing of those devices are just so stark quest pro had a lot of potential labeled with it apple is taking a grounded approach and telling you straight up that hey all these feature sets are available day one at the dollar3499 price point i imagine that for professionals this is the audience they will be appealing to with this for your average consumer this is way outside their price range mind you what they showed off was neat but dollar3499 neat nah i will wait for that vision se i will not get one because i do not think i am part of the audience they are targeting and dollar3499 is too much just happy to see another big company enter the mixed reality space  how people can not see this astounds me vision pro vision se vision yeah the naming system is pretty good it has lidar for hand tracking not camera based the cable is to a battery pack not tethered to a phone or computer i feel like a lot of you need to wait until the keynote is over before throwing out criticism because most of the negative things you are pointing out get addressed literally 5 minutes after you write those comments gt it has lidar for hand tracking not camera based rip elon fanboys tesla is own engineers told him not to completely remove radar they said we were not there yet for camera technology there are a lot of kids and gamers here who are just looking for any opportunity to shit on it from a technical standpoint this looks amazing if it works the way it says it does my criticism is more on its use case and intended audience i am pretty sure that even the most hardcore of apple fans are not used to dishing out dollar3500 for even a personal device they played hard toward the non business crowd so it has me confused as i could never seen any regular person buying this for such a price like it looks really great from a technical standpoint and maybe even worth that money but it is like the varjo aero so good but totally out of the hands of any average person even enthusiasts maybe for such a price i think vr enthusiasts would at least like to you know play vr games or use steam and for anyone not convinced that ar should even be a thing this is going to look cool but totally unattainable i only hope it just gives people at least a somewhat better idea of what ar is actually capable of as it is a real device now not to mention also stuck to apple is ecosystem gt i am pretty sure that even the most hardcore of apple fans are not used to dishing out dollar3500 for even a personal device there is a reason all the people they showed demoing the device lived in mansions and wore designer clothes lol i think they made the right choice go all out on tech regardless of cost it is not going to sell a lot but it is a start they positioned it as a replacement for a computer screen speakers which is smart like a macbook could easily set you back dollar2 3k now will people be replacing their laptops with this gen 1 probably not but a few years from now who knows i agree it seems super odd they put so much tech into this for what they are advertising as a desktop movie viewer that is not a use case that people enjoy using ar vr for i mean it is a use case and is definitely nice to have sitting around with some friends i made in big screen to watch a movie and throw popcorn around is good times too it is just not what i would expect to be the main use case for a headset that is 2 to 3 times more expensive than even the quest pro a headset many people did not buy and that had similar features like color passthrough eye and face tracking good lenses but with standalone vr and pcvr content it is not a bad headset by any means from what i see in fact it is a technical marvel possibly with its own built from the ground up os i just have to ask who in the world is going to buy such an expensive device to bring on aboard a plane to watch movies that is definitely the main stickler it will do what it does very well better than any of the competition but a quest pro does it almost as well for less than a 1 3rd of the cost while being capable of far more honestly even that seems optimistic because a 2 hour battery life is not even enough for most movies the vision pro is an incredibly niche device that is trying to create a market that does not yet exist at a price point far too high for even vr enthusiasts it shows the potential for the next decade far more than it offers anything today gt that is not a use case that people enjoy using ar vr for well not yet because we did not have any device that even function for that use case apple seems pretty confident that this thing can be used for movies and reading text without feeling like a downgrade over a regular monitor or tv it is what it is it is expensive but they did not hold back on technology or innovation i would rather it be that way as years progress it will get cheaper if you want cheap there is quest that was my thought if they are gonna price this at mac level prices they better throw everything they got at it in terms of technology it is pretty ideal positioning it is essentially doing the things it needs to be usable as a primary compute device that let is you do the things that you would normally do on your normal computing devices but spatially that is very different from a vr headset that can show you a preview of the experience of spatial computing but for the low resolution spotty accuracy questionable controls lack of comfort and jank ar people are complaining about the price because they have been anchored by subsidized vr consoles they will get annoyed when they realize apple has just skipped making toys and dove straight into the eventual end game of computing interfaces and thus the price relates to high end computing devices like mac books pros and not gaming first devices like consoles yeah this is the thing i do not think people are appreciating this is by far the most complete device we are getting in the vr ar space it is not supposed to complement anything it is supposed to be its own all encompassing device for now you will still need a mac though unless you want to limit yourself to ipad apps while no technical specs were mentioned they did say 12 ms per frame which translates to 90 hz also the displays will have more pixels than a 4k tv per eye the 12ms was referring to the passthrough latency though oh was it i did not catch that thanks longtime since 2015 vr user here this is absolutely phenomenal and needs more praise instead of putting apple down and chewing on the pricesticker this is not a quest competitor you can have your vr gamingconsole made by several parties this is a first of its kind spatial computing device with focus on working first me time and entertainment second understandably it is just the beginning what is important is that apple took the plunge they introduced a completely new experience the tech will only evolve bye bye screens a completely new experience for what for working harder and watching tv except it is not new at all  exactly but some people are just too shortsighted to see what this means as for the price tag the first iphone also cost way more than how much people were used to paying for a phone back then look back to the ipod the iphone was conceptualized as an ipod that could make phone calls before ipod there was just cassette tape walkman and cd rw disc players maybe a few primitive mp3 players around the same time but nothing with a customer facing design or os built in it looks cool i would pay dollar1000 for it looks lovely but my immediate thought is that that big concave single piece of glass on the front is going to get scratched to hell the first time you put it face down on the counter by accident do not think that is going to be cheap to replace some clip on plastic cover is going to be an essential 3rd party purchase and that will kinda hurt the fancy look it has going very first thoughts reactions it is gigantic i thought it would be much more sleek and more natural looking i am cautious because i also thought apple watch and airpods looked ridiculous initially but the general public got over it but this might as well be a quest pro on your face even worse with the puck dangling off it quite surprised how little emphasis on ar very little overlays on real world no real mention of shared space interactions really long time focusing on pretty well established almost boring uses of vr ar watching movies viewing photos etc codec avatars really cool and probably super annoying for meta to see apple introducing this to the world literally saying they invented so many things that had nothing to do with them micro oled screens invented by apple really way more consumer emphasis than i expected priced as it is i feel like it really needs a strong professional use case to sell but literally no discussion of professional apps where are the architecture engineering biology etc apps that even the quest pro has very surprised not to see some mention of this type of use case all up it definitely sets the bar but i think it gives plenty of room for others to pitch cheaper but only slightly worse devices into the midrange dollar1k 2k where quest pro sits i need to see someone wearing it in real life to understand how gawky it really looks it looks very weird in the pictures and photos i have seen and i think it totally undoes all the work they have done to overcome the isolation etc with the eyesight etc was a fov mentioned at work and missing small bits of the presentation 3499 99 wow i am curious now they mentioned using it to watch 3d movies but no mention of how you get the content will disney start streaming certain movies in 3d afaik the only way to get 3d content right now are the handful of 3d blu ray releases and new 3d tvs are not even a thing anymore obviously talking about porn all of a sudden the q3 is looking pretty damn good this vision thing better be cheap for what i am seeing i expect these limitations from ar glasses not a vr headset with a tethered puck the price of 7 quest 3 is dollar3500 lol apple and cheap do not usually go together the eyes are hilarious honestly seems like cool tech but not really gonna change anything for vr gaming unless you can connect other vr controllers and integrate it with steam this thing isnt made for gaming tho its like every apple product primariy a lifestyle and productivity tool and i think it looks pretty promising tech wise to evaluate this onto the next level the price tho is the thing that will hinder the mainstream spread 3499dollar is alot even for apple hardcore fans it is clearly not even made for vr it very quickly established itself as ar and i do not see this competing with any vr headsets for vr space in the same way that vr headsetes do not compete in ar even if they are trying to this thing is a cousin to vr headsets but not a sibling i honestly did not expect apple to make such a large hmd this is the aspect that disappoints me the most i believe this will turn a lot of people off from buying it and adopting this platform despite the specs being really amazing seems like a mistake to make the form factor so large this thing looks amazing and it is too bad that pcvr is almost definitely off the table at least at first starting at 3499dollar d that is without taxes and battery lol oh the positive side if it proves to be good enough we will see proper implementation of vr desktops that are not hacked up dollar10 solutions that barely work on the realistic side lmao price battery life and everything else you are not gonna sit with your loved one wearing this meme thing on your head to watch a romcom you are not gonna wear it if you have a small kid that needs your attention you are not gonna wear it in any situation that is not i live alone or i am in my home office working work gt oh the positive side if it proves to be good enough we will see proper implementation of vr desktops that are not hacked up dollar10 solutions that barely work time for microsoft to reanimate the decaying corpse of wmr portal since that was doing exactly the same thing that apple is doing now microsoft just kind of gave up on it for no reason and never even bothered to port it to openxr so it can be accessed from other headsets also microsoft building a mixed reality brand of headsets but kind of forgetting to enable any actual mixed reality functions not a great idea still if they hurry up they still have a chance to not be another zune or windows phone but they just fired almost everybody from the wmr teams so probably not even though i will never own one because of the price i hope it is successful if it is then it will mean more companies jumping on the bandwagon and could lead to an ar vr arms race to do things better and cheaper if anyone remembers the first iphone it was basically a really slick ipod that made phone calls it was nothing radically new until it got the app store and 3g internet capability this may underwhelm a bit right now but i expect version 2 to knock it the rest of the way out of the park the price tag is ridiculously steep but some of these features look great a seemingly very well developed product with some impressive specs and tech i imagine in a few years and with a few generations of refinement this could be something special first gen iphone kind of sucked first gen apple watch sucked but they proved a concept and a few years later they had improved drastically in every aspect from software and features to processing and battery power and changed their respective industries first gen products always stink a bit and are never worth it for your average consumer that is just common knowledge in the tech world i hope this kickstarts consumer interest in vr from outside the enthusiast space it currently occupies i think that is kind of their goal this specific model will not be the device to bring ar vr to the mainstream but after a couple of generations of tweaking and the inevitable price drop it just could be i am not overly excited about this headset as it stands but i am very excited about what they are doing and what it will be like 3 4 years down the line still holy fuck too expensive most people are butthurt by the price which is understandable but the technology and functionality is unprecedented should be amazing to use as a recap 4k per eye multiple virtual monitors for working in ar eye tracking pancake lens video calls 3d video recording and viewing full integration with apple ecosystem so you can use answer calls text messages or use any 3rd party iphone app in ar there is not any other system that can do all this i did that in the paris subway in 2015 with the first samsung gear vr people called the cops on me imagine becoming the biggest threat in a paris subway by wearing a vr headset especially in 2015 what were you doing with a headset in the subway maybe humping something in the air relax let the guy buy a sandwich well what was he doing in 2015 with a headset lmao that is an early adopter for sure gear vr released in 2015 i know a lot of people who had it you should have told them it was performance art why did they call the cops on you the furious masturbation was a wee bit too much for the poor poor french  are sunglasses also banned does not seem like a vr headset covers much more than that it also blocks the nose and sung glasses are somewhat see through aswell as you can look around the fact that you wore that in public in paris without having it stolen is astonishing why the hell would anyone call the cops on you for that weird ass people a way to get mugged for sure who is dumb enough to rob someone that everyone has their eyes trained on a meth addict a crackhead nobody in london would give a fuck they watch or film people getting mugged every day same in brazil once i was clearly getting robbed going back from school people ignored thank god my phone was so shit the guy gave it back lmao muggers hate this one weird trick you underestimate the general public is desire to not get involved everyone having their eyes trained on you would suggest it has not been normalized once they hit the subway it is just a matter of time they snatch it and run right before the train doors close if they knew its price and knew they could sell it then they would snatch it for sure you have not been to the bay area recently i see i have been out with my vision pro a few times a couple people came up to ask me questions i also got a ton of stares i was not mugged lol if you think the public would do anything you have never been to london  after the mugging for sale on ebay later that week they could not sell it because it is locked sorry to hear u live in such a shitty place i have been to nyc countless times and i have never be robbed there is a certain group of americans that like to pretend big cities are crime ridden hellscapes they need to be able to sell this to people that live in shitty places in order to make a profit believe it or not you live in the minority of a safe area not that i want to but if i would wear one in public here it would get ripped off my face it would be worthless to whoever stole it unless they just want to look at it nope they will sell it someone will buy it even if they know they need to attempt to break the activation lock gt normalize wearing a vr headset in public i would not go that far what they are trying to normalize is spending dollar4000 on what amounts to a really heavy phone that you strap to your face can not use it like a vr headset while you are walking around anyway it is just a big awkward and insanely priced smart phone i am hella surprised they released the headset without their maps app being turned into ar because they neither want nor expect people to be walking around outside wearing them maybe at a stretch in a park or public area in which you stand still has any of their marketing at all been outside i have the vision pro and that is honestly ridiculous to me ar maps integrated into the headset would be amazing they are literally wearing them in public as a very pathetic way to show people that they own it yeah a few people wearing them in public is not the same thing as this being normalized remember glassholes here is a little secret those people were not assholes they were just people wearing tech glasses in public and it freaked some morons the fuck out and spawned an undeserved nickname for anyone wearing one just because some people are paranoid about being recorded in public can not live with the fact that some dorks are willing to wear something that they themselves would never wear in public i know for sure avp will cause some people to get into fights soon moron why do you keep staring at me asshole avp wearer oh no i am not staring at you i am watching a video moron no asshole you have been mad dogging me for the past 5 minutes knock if off or i am going to shove those ski goggles up your ass avp wearer no you do not understand i am watching a video on a floating screen i did not even see you there at all moron punches avp wearer life in 90 fov that is the main reason everyone should skip this gen you can not actually use it while walking i guess you could use it on a treadmill but why just listen to music and do not sweat on a 3k headset treadmill is one time it does make sense simulate walking through a nice environment throw in a fan and an air freshener and you might forget you are in a basement or spare room for a few minutes same for exercycles and rowing machines thing is way too big and heavy you would have sweat all over the thing i do not believe for a second that it is comfortable to actually workout with it this is coming from a beatsaber fanatic i would never take it to the gym i can not even wear over ear headphones without sweating up a storm all over them no way i am risking my expensive vr set at the gym i guess if you are so rich you do not care but then you would not be working out at a public gym it would be a flex of wealth using these while sweating in them i would be okay doing so on a 500 dollar device but for a 3 5k device i work out with a quest 1 2 and its not bad as long as you fit it properly and have good airflow in the room it is fine with a rowing machine with quest 3 my issue is the sweat pressing against your face which could cause bad acne i am sure there are solutions for this though i do this with my exercise bike and the gta v vr mod it is pretty incredible i tried my quest 2 on a treadmill and it really does not work the lenses immediately become foggy from the excess body heat and your sweat makes it feel way too gross plus at all times you feel a certain discomfort from not directly seeing where you are walking even if i was using that safety thing you clip to your clothes and holding the handle of the treadmill using a tablet is infinitely more convenient and i would even prefer using a laptop to watch videos over using a vr headset on a treadmill again i hear the bikes that connect to the software work well the equipment tells the software how fast to move the scene so it feels immersive i do not know have not tried it myself liked using my q3 that way no foggibg but i used a kiwi pro strap with battery and want to get a bobo with a fan but for me it worked good no fogging use my silicone strap from the q2 and might have to wipe it off a little after but idk if i am lucky with my face shape lol the kiwi pro strap is better for working out i read so i got it because of that tho if you do not want to be in a basement just go have a walk outdoors unless there is severe weather i guess i could see the headset being used to watch a show or something while on the treadmill but i could just use a phone seems better than to wear that thing during exercise a lot of people live in cities with no nice walking places around a lot of people live in suburban sprawl with no sidewalks that is a crime against humanity welcome to texas pardner i use vzfit on quest 2 quite a bit apart from the weather issue it enables you to walk run cycle anywhere in the world by converting streetview data in to 3d more interesting than walking past the same place for the 100th time and you can just pick up and play without worrying about making yourself presentable this is my dream walk through a canyon or stuff like a famous riverwalk or even just city streets or a beach could familiarize yourself with the area around your hotel for an upcoming vacation or just pretend like you have money to go on vacation or walk run the route of an upcoming or famous race course it is pretty great but it is not without it is flaws it is a subscription app the 3d is not always perfect though it seems to have improved a lot and you have to select your route in advance you can not just randomly decide to change direction apart from that it is great google earth vr is also incredible if you have not tried that yet and it is free i know you can connect a bike trainer to gta 5 and ride around liberty city that would be fun probably can you imagine the smell sweating on the headband yuck or just people flexing that they bought a dollar3 500 toy yep this social status is the 1 selling point apple in a nutshell this shows the opposite of high social status it is lame af how will people know i own it if i do not wear it fucking losers this this needs to be higher this is exactly what i came here to say nailed it on the first try it is all part of a viral marketing campaign and you are helping spread it i live in nyc i doubt it i have actually seen about a dozen people wearing this thing who have not been being recorded the goal in a campaign like this is to get the public recording and reposting videos an ebike company sent me a free ebike of i promised to ride it around in public a bunch and leave some reddit comments i am not saying all of them are plants but it is very likely at least some of them were if not most just seems weird to pay for that when there is people like me doing that for free why would they need to be recorded for it to be marketing the marketing is go out and normalize this product the pictures and videos from random people are the icing in the cake we should all want apple to succeed here maybe we will get samsung sony lg microsoft google panasonic philips etc in on the spatial computing action if this thing takes off i am all for it and do you have any proof of this is that bad no 3 different photos of people using the headset should not be considered normalizing behavior especially since the 3rd image is a snapshot from a video that gone viral and the 1st image is some fan taking a picture of a youtuber named canoopsy making one of those i lt verb gt lt product gt for 24 hours videos but for the apv seriously how does anybody know if the people in these images are genuine end users or are paid actors all the people commenting on that youtube short that the 3rd image came from was either ridiculing the stupidity of bringing such an expensive device onto the nyc subway of all places or mentioning that they will never risk bringing it outside if they ever owned one i scrolled past half a dozen of these on the reddit front page with people mostly mocking them not sure if its a viral campaign but there is an idiot driving a tesla with one on and that can not be good for marketing i am sure that he at least had the headset on driving mode there is no driving mode that is a leftover from the focus feature on their other devices which sync to the headset it is meant for your phone to silence notifications and such they are engagement farmers but i do not think this will stop right people go out with their quest headsets on and get called questholes and ridiculed online people do the same thing with avp and it is suddenly visionary and great and should be normalised the cult of apple really is a powerful thing people using it in real life are being ridiculed online just not here nobody thinks anything about the people in those photos is cool or visionary yeah exactly its fucking weird it looks dumb but i want an ar world so i am glad that apple is reputation lets them blaze this trail everywhere i have seen images of these people have ridiculed them online too i do not even like apple but apple haters are something else this is just marketing not really he shows how he is using it while walking through nyc it is fucking interesting tbh i cringed out half way through that sure but imagine having this in 5 10 years mobile phones were cringe too in the 90s now everyone and their goldfish do have at least one mobile phone this thing could be interesting in so many fields esp when other companies follow and the prices dropp to 300 500dollar gt mobile phones were cringe too in the 90s now everyone and their goldfish do have at least one mobile phone i do not remember that ever being the case i do remember people me included not seeing the point of them but thats something completely different of course define normalize please there is nothing normal about this from dollarus3499 or dollarus291 58 per month for 12 months buy apple vision pro yeh i think if i had one i would probably forgo using it while eating at a restaurant or travelling on train and leave it at home normalize did you even read the comments under these outside of vr subreddits or on the yt vids unless its a vid that a tech youtuber posted the comments are mostly negative commenting about utopia and this being super weird amp x200b the best bet is on normal looking ar glasses like virtue or xreal i can wear the latter in the gym and no one even notices if i hide the cable under the shirt if there would be a set that would be clear and still be able to cast image i would imagine it would need to be a really bright one as with xreals etc you need to have a cover or be in a dark room for it to really work well then you can call it normalizing on top of some way of using it without weirdly tapping your hands in the air google in 2013 i guess you guys are not ready for that yet but your kids are gonna love it this and every other post on other subs is definitely an ad plant remembering life before the headsets is going to define the zoomer generation haha we used to watch videos on 5in screen lmfao ikr im be so old fr no cap honestly i am really excited to see what the future holds for us i would put money on all these just being marketing you would be surprised how many low key campaigns consist of paying someone to walk into a busy part of town and consume product let is see how many people are wearing them three months to three years out it is definitely a flex to casually do this at a restaurant practically though depending on the material those pristine white cloth head straps will absorb and feature dirt sweat oil and whatever succulent cuisine environment smells you spend a lot of time around just like all cloth head straps i hope the bands are washable with any mr solution this does excite me that one day you will be able to gather with friends and enjoy shared environment aware mr experiences it opens a lot of doors it is a very sad pathetic flex you have a very low bar for something becoming normalized yeah except dorks have been doing this since quest so no apple did not normalize wearing a vr headset spatial computer is fucking stupid on your face in public until thieves realise people are out in public with dollar3500 worth of headset on their head it is not normalized if it was normalized people would not bother taking candid photos of people wearing these headsets your post proves the opposite i had so much fun using my gearvr on trains planes amp buses in 2014 2015 in the casey neistat video he tried to use it on the subway and it did not work i was skeptical about this being a marketing campaign but im pretty positive it is one now it did not work for him on subway because he did not turn on travel mode which would have allowed him to continue using the vp while on the move if that video was a paid marketing campaign would not apple have told him about the travel mode instead of letting him create the expectation that there is no way to use the vp in moving vehicles with that said these are not the result of a marketing campaign but rather just random people who want to go viral on the internet i used it on the nyc subway with travel mode and can confirm it works pretty well but how much is apple paying you to do that s very cool just a hype train apple is a cool brand to teenagers no wearing a headset has not been normalized these are douchbags normalize is quite a stretch nothing about this is normal this is not normalized lmao great way to get jumped surprised people are not getting jacked considering the price it is not normalized they look like idiots no this is the 2024 version of neon skiing outfits and bula hats it is not just because of the brand coolness the apple vision pro passthrough is kind of the only one good enough for wearing it in daily life it is awesome to see i am loving all the hype and interest in the space i wore my quest 3 at a toyota dealership waiting on my car place was packed with people no one was even paying attention to me lol can the triple a studios make a fucking serviceable mmo now please zenith just died and i am bored now it is not normalized a few people are trying out their new toy that is all just like goole glasses hehe fondly remember the glassholes posts do you really think anyone who wears makeup will ruin their face for that for example until they are a simple pair of glasses they will never be normalised people get mugged in london for a canada goose coat going to be a field day when there is gbp3k on your face and watching vr porn on the tube lol how do we tell op that these pics are staged for marketing purposes try actually wearing one in public and you will get robbed in under a second where do you live lol  could be trauma from growing up living in bad locations my entire life but i will never wear something that expensive while out lol i would like this to continue to become more normal honestly there are many situations where i would like to use my vr headsets where i do not because it still seems weird or unusual i want it to become normalized why are people in the comments so mad that someone is using a vr headset in public what is so bad about it cringe i thought it was cringe when people started using their mobile phones back in the early 90s because who can be that important that they need to be available 24 7 i thought it was cringe to pay at the cashier with a card for a bottle e g pepsi i thought it was cringe when people started using blutooth headphones in public is the vision pro cringe now yeah kinda will it be cringe in 5 years when more companies will have devices like that not really people have been using quest 2 is in public for 3 years this is viral marketing and everyone is falling for it it definitely makes sense on a treadmill idk about a dinner table with another person but who knows they might both be doing something cool like eating on the top of a 100 story building if thats possible does not make sense on a treadmill because sweat will fog it up while eating is fucking regarded that one actually made the least sense how can anyone stand sweating into their headset you have not played creed or thrill of the fight or any of the other hundreds of physical vr games obviously people exercise in vr all the time i dunno about everyone else but i take several precautions to not get my dollar400 quest 2 very sweaty new face plate that does not absorb sweat i also wear a headband to absorb forehead sweat as much as possible so it does not drip down inside no way i would wear something as expensive as the vision pro while i exercise especially with no third party non absorbent facial interfaces yet although i would guess that most who already own a vision pro have more money than sense so what do they care if they ruin it it makes sense in that there is a use case for it who goes out to lunch with someone and sits in a headset it was not too long ago that everyone wore masks for an entire year or more so someone wearing a device that covers their eyes does not really bother me it looks kinda cool when it is doing the aurora effect would have been nice if they had different headband and light seal colors jesus this comment section i am not an apple fan but the irrational level of hate for the avp on this sub is kinda cringy agreed they are clearly over priced but if people want to pay a wad of cash and help make vr ar popular at the same time we should be cheering them on but attacking them if i saw someone wearing this in public i would actively avoid them real life wall e i am just waiting to see someone walking the grocery store with one people are too caught up in their apple bad mentality to realize this pushes vr as a whole forward lmao much rather own a quest 3 i am broke just wait until all the returns because they were not careful and the sunlight ruined the lens not many seem to get the viral marketing apple is pushing this is to put vp into the fomo category and i am all for it because this will push vr more into everyone is mind and when they know they can not get the dollar3500 overpriced metal they will go for the cheaper one is and that helps drive sale overall this is same as how android became so popular and samsung pushed the envelope through that so this is good for future vr normalize after a few days and a few photos of the same few people that is not normal while i am not mad about the publication i love it i think it may be good for the vr community if dicks do not ruin it let is be honest this is not going to end well to be fair the vision pro has the highest quality sensors on the market with one of the best mixed reality until this past year most headsets did not have good mixed reality and standalone capabilities first pic is a reviewer in toronto some say it is a paid promotion which i doubt i think apple just sent them a copy much like any other big names google glasses were better i am a little surprised there has not been a news piece on a snatch and run theft yet imagine if apple made permanent dick enlargement pills  shipping a product that has a purpose outside of gaming and doing it well probably has more to do with it meta has been shipping game consoles this is a computer they are similar in a lot of ways but in 2 days i have probably used my vision pro more than my total time with quest 2 and quest pro combined this is what quest pro should have been could still be but meta wants you to buy from them rather than expose the play store apps i guess if it costs 500dollar is a peasants thing if it costs 3500dollar its cool and worth to show off d this is one week of influencers wearing the thing in stupid situations for the clicks and then it will stop at least these two are not doing something actively dangerous like driving see no problem whatsoever but yeah keep poking apple q3 was able to do it before avp btw absolutely the same kind of images came out when quest 3 launched there is nothing new here you can look up the meta glassholes type of articles that came out at launch i would say there were way more quest 3 examples out in the wild than the apple one so kinda weak there was even a viral video of something crazy happening and in the background there was just some guy chilling in his quest 3 not phased by it not normal i would not call that normalized lol this is not normal when you are out you should be present in the moment there is enough to look at in the real world without adding all sorts of virtual layers on top of it this is not the future the future is gaming and social networking while using vr devices at home not in public meta is far closer to this vision than whatever apple is playing at apple is new marketing campaign no way these are not staged apple this is not going to catch on lol these people look absolutely ridiculous i remember people saying the same thing about mobile phones 30 years ago also air pods i do not think it will catch on this generation but given time i remember when samsung released the galaxy note 1 with a massive 5 3 display and people said that it looks ridiculous look at us now people used to universally hate anyone who used a cell phone to take a call in public when the blackberry crackberry was the big thing everyone mocked how people were glued to the screen all the time all of this is normal now i am an old nerd so this looks more like i imagined the future as a kid there need to be more jumpsuits though maybe food in pill form too meh i hear u but honestly disagree top hats look ridiculous to us now but they were of the highest fashion for a long time yeah i am betting things like this are high fashion in next ten years this is what people were saying when it was announced apple is a trend setter not on some fanboy shit just straight up the power they have to make the craziest shit completely normal is truly wild airpods we are ugly when they were announced now it is weird if you do not have them and wireless headphones are pretty standard nowadays people were skeptical of the iphone when it was first revealed now it is one of the biggest items in the world and people will tease you about not having one apple watch same thing apple making a vr headset was is the best thing for vr because now it will become normal and more mainstream and normal people will actually know what vr is or at least have a better understanding of it vr oh yeah like that apple thing i think it is all marketing placement if anyone was going to get their customers to engage in this kind of cringe behaviour over technology it was going to be apple wo meta quest 3 did it first by a few months and you ridicule it apple does it few months later and it is amazing are you guys stupid i would rather a 500 dollar headset that does the same as a 3500 dollar one which is besides the point point is just coz it is apple does not make it cooler only thing that stopped me from buying it was display port i thought they would have a link variant like the 3rd had missing dp was such a huge letdown the future is now old man same thoughts here too too unsure how it would be compared to my reverb g2 over wifi be nice if i could at least try it first wait you can use a g2 over wifi no i meant the pico 4 like quality of pico with wifi oh gotcha its damn good actually it replaced my hp reverb g2 it is not an unpopular opinion just a really lazy opinion with zero supporting details why unpopular as long as you have found what works best for you that is great imho vr headset comparisons are always subjective so what you find is best might not be the case with others in about a month is time someone is bound to say that their nice new quest 3 is the best vr headset ever i hope that person is me lol true i sincerely hope so i have never tried another so i can not compare but i am very happy quest pro is superior in almost every way also like thrice the price originally from what i have read about the p4 you are 100percent correct the only place p4 wins is price and am happy to pay for real touch controllers not in resolution not in color passthrough not in weight quest pro is passthrough is a joke not sure why you are being down voted quest pro is heavy and has worse comfort overall and pico 4 is higher resolution its a pretty significan not bump in resolution too neither pass through is particularly good i expect quest 3 to be better than both from what pico 4 owners have said i would much rather have quest pro is grainy but prospective correct passthrough than pico 4 is nausea inducing mess and another gt now to the bad part it is absolutely and utterly disorienting walking around with passthrough on feels like being on a psychedelic trip edit looks like they have improved it greatly over the last 9 months this guy loves it quest pro is passthrough is actual 3d stereo cameras with a color camera overlay it may not look as good to you but comparing them as if they are the same and one is just more pretty is crazy one has actual depth to it and is mapping out the room and does do some neat stuff even while people give it shit for not having the depth sensor then depth map it does built is much better than no map at all like the pico it is being dropped by meta so long term support is dubious at best tbf long term support for pico has not been proven either true but the product has not been canceled pico as a company has been making headsets at least as long as meta and the pico 4 is a 4th generation product they are a vr headset company that is their main business we are still waiting on the quest 3 not as long as oculus no the pico 4 store is completely new and is the first hmd under bytedance pico was always a vr headset company before being acquired by bytedance their focus on earlier products was on the corporate space as opposed to the consumer retail space it was only after the bytedance acquisition that they started to have a more consumer focus pico interactive was started in 2015 in the san francisco bay area so they have been around for 8 years now so while not as old as oculus they are not exactly the new kid on the block either for a feature packed headset yes for a used quest pro usually 600 700 you get a pimax crystal with worse resolution and connection but you get superior lenses controllers and standalone you can not really beat that not in cheapness and in many aspects it is a tie while i agree that the pro is better in many ways this post is about 1 month away from the quest3 launch where it is looking to be a way better deal than the pico 4 in everyway possible obviously we should all wait and see but we are 1 month from a new quest release and when is the pico 5 coming out it was pretty obvious to many paying attention that the pico seemed to be rushed out to beat the quest3 to market and once they did i do not thing meta was rushed to get the quest3 out right away the quest3 is going to be very hard to beat for the money for awhile it is the most you are going to get for dollar500 for some time to come just look at the specs on it problem with q3 being single panel low fov like q2 slightly boosted res is not going to put it over the edge 100percent superior i purchased a pico 4 about 2 weeks ago over wireless the video quality was awful and there was terrible lag and i have gigabit internet i experienced much of the same with a wired connection for pcvr it was awful as a standalone headset it works as it should and is very good i found it extremely uncomfortable though until i replaced the standard face gasket ended up buying a dpvre4 for pcvr and it is a brilliant headset i found a discount code and purchased it from their us website which after all calculations brought the price down to gbp360 which is a bargain the controllers and tracking are great the headset is light and easy to set up the resolution even though advertised the same as quest 2 is fantastic as it has display port connection image is nice and sharp and even the smallest of text is very easy to read crystal clear image and i have noticed zero screen door affect honestly if anyone is stumped for what headset to buy for pcvr and is not bothered by a wired connection this headset for its price point is unbeatable imo your internet speed doesnt matter for wireless pcvr your local network matters perhaps you could elaborate for me i do not really understand all of it all i wanted was a headset i can play pcvr with my son recommended the pico so i got it but had nothing but unpleasant experiences whilst trying to play on pc first of all you should have a good wi fi 6 router reserved for the exclusive use of the pico 4 you connect to the router wirelessly with the headset and your pc should be connected to the router via ethernet cable finally you need to use virtualdesktop client on your pico 4 and virtualdesktop server software on your pc that is the the best way to get a high quality wireless pcvr experience so i have a wifi 6 router in my house but my vr room is not in the house it is about 25 feet away down the bottom of the garden i have a wifi extender in there and run an ethernet cable from that to the pc i have literally zero knowledge and understanding of wireless routers it is not possible for me to run an ethernet cable from my house to my garden room i was considering ethernet plugs that transfer the connection through my home electrical wiring but i am not sure if that is going to work help if not what else could i do as mentioned before i have the dpvre4 now and i am quite happy with it for my room scale stuff but if i could get pico 4 working perfectly i would use it on my sim rig so your connection to the internet does not matter much here it is streaming between your pc that is playing the game and the headset so it is that connection that matters to maximize that connection you do not want your pc and your headset to both be on the wireless to me it sound like your internet is up at your house and you garden house in down somewhere that is all fine i do not know what hardware you are using but asus makes what i would tell most people to get cause i have had good luck with them asus has a feature that make one router connect to the other like a extender so what i would do is buy 2 asus wifi6 routers of same type and make sure they support air mesh put one at your house and then connect it to the other down the hill with air mesh they will both be controlled buy the single router up the hill all layer3 ip address type settings on on the main router up the hill where your internet connection is the import ant part is that down the hill you plug your pc that i also assume here is down the hill close to your headset but either way plug your pc in to either router vis a ethernet cable then make sure you headset is connected to that local wifi6 router it should see that as the strongest wifi6 ssid i always make my wifi6 ssid different than my older 2 4 gig and really only put devices on that wifi6 freq if they need it try to not use that same connection while using headset etc it is ok to share the connection if you manage what is on it smart and you are aware of what is going on on your network the asus admin page tells you what is connected to each freq and by cable off what of the 2 routers if you do not understand all this that is fine but honestly your not going to get a good streaming experience if you think your just going t plug in to wifi in just any setup and it will work your going to have to understand some things i do not want to use my pico 4 wirelessly i want to use it with a wired connection whilst in my sim rig i have another dedicated hard wired headset i use for room scale stuff even whilst having pico 4 tethered to pc via usb c the compression looks like a shitty youtube video if i could get it to work via a cable perfectly i would use it as my dedicated sim rig headset so you started your complaint with how the headset does not work well over wifi and because your internet was slow so people were trying to help it seems you do not understand a lot about the networking so asked to have some explain now you do not want it at all not sure what to say but i do not have a pico4 i use a auest pro but do not really trust your option given you do not seem to know what you want or anything about what your talking about honestly well to be honest with you you obviously have not read the entire thread i started saying how i have had a terrible experience with the pico 4 over wireless and wired then i went on to say how i already have a hard wired pcvr headset that i am using other people jumped on board and started trying to teach me about wireless vr and how to set it up and such i never asked anyone to do that i simply asked people to explain what they were saying because i did not understand i never once said i wanted my pico 4 as a wireless pcvr headset but as people were replying to me in a lingo i do not understand i simply asked them to elaborate to help further my knowledge on the subject so back in your box mate well you do not have wireless set up optimally for vr so you are bound to have problems with wireless yeah a dedicated wired device like dpvr or reverb g2 are better at wired you do not seem to have done your own homework with regards to the product you purchased versus your use case if your goal was to have a wired headset the pico 4 probably should not have been your first choice the pico 3 neo has a dedicated display port connection and that probably would have suited you better however since you do have a pico 4 the people on this thread including myself have been trying to help you get the best wireless experience because with the proper setup you can use the pico 4 wirelessly and get results as good as a wired connection given the choice i prefer wireless because i do not have to be limited by dangling cables ymmv if you are still stuck on using a wired setup with your pico 4 you can google plenty of youtube videos or search reddit for how to do that through pico is streaming assistant app if you are willing to listen to people on this thread with experience using the pico 4 we can probably get you sorted you can take it or leave it up to you first your internet connection speed to your pc is not relevant to the pico 4 wireless use case if your pc requires an internet connection powerline ethernet equipment is readily available and is relatively cheap otherwise using a wi fi 6 router to connect to your main router is also doable in any case you should have a dedicated wi fi 6 router for the pico 4 to use second your pc should be physically connected via ethernet cable to the wi fi 6 router your pico 4 will connect to third you need to purchase vd virtual desktop from the pico store and install it on your pico 4 headset then download the vd desktop pc software and install on your pc do not buy vd from steam or anywhere else it will not work there are already dozens of videos about how to configure vd for use on pico 4 you can find those guides on youtube if you get everything set up correctly you will have a great wireless experience herein lies your problem a wi fi extender probably does not offer the wireless bandwidth required to have a good wireless experience in the pico 4 there is a reason people are telling you to get a wi fi 6 router you need a high bandwidth 5ghz connection to your pico 4 to get good wireless results you do not need to go overboard on the wi fi 6 router a 1200 1800 mbps unit is more than enough since it is basically only being used by your headset wireless pcvr streams between your pc laptop and your headset the data travels from pc to router to headset it does not leave your local network so your internet subscription speed doesnt matter what matters is the speed of the elements in your local network a wired ethernet connection between pc and router is best but verify that both pc and router support at least 1gbps which is common on all modern routers also your router should support wifi 6 for best quality as it supports higher data throughput unfortunately some fiddling could be required to get a good experience for pcvr using the pico first the software pico uses to stream from the pc to the pico is not that great that is why people always recommend virtual desktop which offers better image quality besides since a constant transfer of lots of mbps is required you need a router that is at least wifi 5 capable that does not have other devices connected to it although some may be connected they should not be consuming much bandwidth how is the display quality compared to the quest 2 pico has much wider fov i did use q2 at setting 3 and hardly get 85deg measured the pico with amvr interface is around 100 for me edge to edge clarity is much better because of the use of pancake lenses and the fact you have a real ipd adjustment that goes all the way to 72mm i still use my quest2 a lot as the pico4 is pretty much only used as for pcvr the pico store is still barren compared to quest and i have already invested into the oculus meta ecosystem i am the opposite i use my q2 to watch movies 90percent of the time and for pcvr the rest of the time that is almost never nowadays i think pico may be a good option for me   i was going to buy it but after seeing that product i had a feeling like here is advanced brick there is few games so do not complain i am not saying that is a trash headset its for now the best budget pcvr but on standalone side meta is winning also pico did not show anything new or innovating meta had hands tracking and then pico it is going to be the same with ar meta has it so next pico will have it you might say it is like the homework meme it might be better then original but different approach but for me the deal breaker was that meta is investing in vr ar pico just follow question 2 what hmd do you own great device indeed i own it but i still prefer the quest pro better image quality eye tracking and specially software but yes pico 4 would be my second option right now it is a fine opinion i disagree but it is all subjective i agree with this it is a great product that does not get the recognition i would use it more if it had some kind of displayport support it is very good i would say it might be the best value for money but not the best headset ever is it a really good hmd for the price yeah sure sounds about right the best hmd out there absolutely not pico 4 ai not ever gonna be able to compete with the likes of the pimax 12k bigscreen is beyond varjo is aero etc there is a range of ridiculous headsets out there that leave any current mass market headset in the dust pimax crystal is too bulky and heavy bigscreen beyond has too small horizontal fov and varjo aero has too small vertical fov can not do wireless with the latter two pico 4 strikes the best balance between good fov and small comfortable form factor while also having above average resolution and wireless pcvr and standalone capabilities it is the best all rounder and yes very affordable edit oh you said pimax 12k does that exist 1 oh my bad the pimax reality 12k is the proper name basically the wired counterpart to the pimax crystal in late development has not been released to the general public yet 2 that is one way of looking at it i will agree with you there it definitely is one of if not the best hmd when it comes to being a jack of all trades i do still side with the fact that different users will have different preferences that will most of the time result in another headset being a much better match but i suppose that is just a different way of looking at how we should use technology 3 to me at least standalone vr will not be an actual selling point until they start putting laptop parts in the headsets as long as snapdragon based headsets running android stay the norm i will just see it as an extra feature that brings the rest of the headset down with it i say this knowing that i have a quest 2 and pico 4 just sat on my desk right now what can you play on it mmm i think a lot of people are enjoying the pico 4 tbh it is too bad both of my orders had faulty warped lenses so i gave up on it this is 2023 everything is spying on you your phone your laptop your browser yes even in incognito mode unless you are living in china and actively saying how bad it is and planning a coup right now you have nothing to be afraid of at least no more than from your phone or browser gt unless you are living in china and actively saying how bad it is and planning a coup right now you have nothing to be afraid of i think the bigger threat is digital information warfare think of the possible ramifications of titok pico users having every aspect of their private lives leaked publicly suddenly everyone is against each other and we implode from the inside remember when southpark did an episode following a similar premise why would bytedance or the chinese government leak pico users private lives publicly they would lose all their gains and they would get literally nothing in return i really do not mean to sound rude so sorry if what i am about to say comes off that way but you understand that pretty much every other week the u s and china are measuring each others dicks calling every small thing that the other does an act of war right obviously myself and pretty much everyone should not want these countries to go to war but if they did china could start off by pitting u s citizens against each other using this tactic weakening the country and causing turmoil edit i would also like to add that tiktok would probably be the bigger weapon considering it has considerably more u s users than the pico but you get the idea no way maybe they would leak out some info about political leaders but they would not get that info from their pico headsets they would get that info from their phones which is already made in china 99percent of the time well i am more of concerned about the link software going through my pc data and sending them away photos files etc or doing same with my keystrokes like passwords etc your browser already sent away your keystrokes twice if you have an adblocker and your phone could have already sent away your photos but it probably did not storage is still not that cheap neither the us nor china transfers all the data of their whole population to themselves there are not enough people in the world to look through all of it and if they use machine learning it will only stop on you if you are planning something against the government again you should only be afraid if you are a terrorist or if you live in china and spread infos about them they do not want you to spread valid points do you think pico is different from let is say lenovo ltt just got hack from something similar lol using section keys maybe its a threat if you work for the czech government i do not see how china skimming your data will affect your life outside of china you have to worry more about your own government accessing your data imo it allows china to conduct corporate espionage blackmail and many other things designed to bolster the influence and power of the ccp in that case we should all be luddites what espionage will they be conducting from my vr headset tethered to my gaming pc i am just unconvinced that they are more a threat to you barring gov employment than say your own government spying on your messages searches etc yup absolutely it possesses the exact same threat tiktok does i have been trying to tell the vr community about this for ages i know that meta should not be allowed to achieve a monopoly on standalone but chinese tech companies are forced to carry out the will of the ccp a government commiting genocide against uigher muslims as i write this comment and is also planning to invade the independent nation of taiwan that means they are forced to limit freedom of speech and criticism of the ccp on their platforms the last thing the tech industry needs is a dictatorship getting it is foot into it valid points what is your view on western companies using china as a manufacturing place and laying in bed with them sadly with how the companies do these days you can not eliminate china though would be nice if yes but companies are a bit hypocritical in this well here is the thing many countries like the usa are trying to move their businesses out of china and into india instead because of the threat china poses to global peace and democracy india on the other hand is significan notly more democratic than china and is a perfect candidate to replace them and uphold the world is demands for manufactured goods hope it will work out although even india could be problem give to boiling pakistan india tensions is not half of pakistan underwater or at least it was a few months ago time flies either way i really do not think pakistan is prepared for a major conflict against india and i heavily doubt china is prepared to support pakistan in it there is valid nuclear threat in that region eh most of it is desert i am sure we will be fine the above is a joke i would not hold up india as a paragon of virtue you complain about china is genocide what do you think has been happening to muslims in india for decades do you know why there is a pakistan also india is one of the big reasons that russia has not been that effected by the sanctions because india does not honor the sanctions their purchase of russian oil has hit all time highs since the ukraine war started not just by 10percent not just by 50percent but by more than 100percent over what it was before the war they get around international sanctions by paying for that oil in rupee instead of in dollars like everyone else india has always aligned itself with russia it is not just a one way street trade between india and russia is booming right now many rusisan products find a ready market in india russia is their arms supplier a perfect candidate i consider many other countries more perfect why not mexico eh mexico too that would save a lot on shipping as well also it is us british who are responsible for the existence of the conflict between india and pakistan oops although i will admit you have a point about india is purchases of oil it is just a race to the bottom with shifting goal posts is not it oh china and india are too inhumane let is go to mexico and fuck them up for a bit until we choose new goal posts your observation is correct it is just fucked up is not it yay let is run from the communist dictator into the open arms of the world is largest scammer population trust me i know the usa is full of lying greedy bastards that would skin their mother alive on a live stream for an extra dollar10 im not saying we are any better only that we may not need to bother moving out of china gt chinese tech companies are forced to carry out the will of the ccp in the us all companies are forced to carry out the will of the us government we call that regulations some of which require them to turn over their data to the us government on demand no warrant required gt a government commiting genocide against uigher muslims as i write this comment and yet we have more people in prison than china both in relative and absolute terms considering the us is a quarter the size of china and yet has more people in prison says something do not you think also we have a 400 year on going genocide against native americans as you wrote that you are probably occupying land that was forcibly taken and the previous residents killed we are still taking their land by force gt and is also planning to invade the independent nation of taiwan answer these questions how many countries has china invaded in the last 50 years how many countries has the us invaded in the same time well compared but it does not alter the security threats no it does not but the same security and privacy concerns are involved when dealing with any company there is little difference in terms of that between tiktok and facebook so if someone is concerned about tiktok they should be just concerned about facebook personally being pro privacy i do not use either tiktok or facebook pro privacy and you defend the ccp china has stronger privacy protections than the us that is another thing you are ignorant of you are on a roll if i were to criticize the us government in public whilst standing in washington i doubt anything at all would happen to me if i were to criticize the ccp in china whilst standing in beijing then i would absolutely be arrested china has hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras four times that of the usa is and has tight regulations over digital communication do you have any proof that china cares more about privacy than the us gt do you have any proof that china cares more about privacy than the us look at their privacy law it is very similar to the eu gdpr law ask anyone that is had to comply with chinese privacy laws and you will get an earful of how effective it is the eu has ruled against facebook due to privacy concerns they have not done so against china because facebook is a company that the eu can pretty easily regulate while china is one of the largest governments and is the largest supplier of exports no europe trades more with the us than china china is not even 2nd it is because facebook is a us company and the us has very little privacy protection very little particularly against the government since any data in a us based company is available to the us government which was the point of the eu ruling that us companies have little to no protection of their data from the us government which is why people seriously concerned about privacy avoid any us based company same here and totally agree with you firstly if tiktok did abide by these regulations then why was bytedance being forced to sell tiktok to an american company in 2020 secondly it is very bold of you to assume that the land in the middle of the british countryside that i am living in was taken forcefully from natives us crime rates are higher than china is but that is because of how strict and repressive it is in china fyi you do not really get freedom of speech expression in china since the regime has bent it is population into submission since the ccp came to power and honestly i would rather have high crime rates than live under the ccp i do not see what crime rates have to do with cultural genocide either yes native americans are still experiencing cultural genocide to this day but does that really excuse what the prc is doing finally this is a stupid question to ask china in the last 50 years has tried to invade vietnam twice on the other hand the usa has invaded panama haiti grenada and kuwait technically iraq however china and the usa had very different goals in mind when carrying out these invasions whilst the usa invaded these nations to restore democracy disrupted by military coups in haiti plus this was sanctioned by a un security council resolution communist insurgents grenada invading foreign powers kuwait iraq invaded kuwait illegally or to detain and bring to justice known criminals panama manuel noriega was wanted for and charged with crimes against humanity and drug trafficking china is invasions only served to boost the influence and power of the nation through land grabs last time i checked china has 17 border disputes with other nations thankfully they cannot act on them due to organisations like the un which would annihilate their economy with sanctions if they ever tried to do that but if we did not have such an establishment i would bet china would be declaring war against every country it shares a border with in conclusion you can fuck right off to china if you want to defend the ccp gt firstly if tiktok did abide by these regulations then why was bytedance being forced to sell tiktok to an american company in 2020 first off tiktok has not been sold to an american company or anyone else if it had then why would the us government still be talking about banning it for being a chinese company tiktok and its chinese counterpart douyin chinese pinyin d uy n is a short form video hosting service owned by the chinese company bytedance gt secondly it is very bold of you to assume that the land in the middle of the british countryside that i am living in was taken forcefully from natives second i guess you do not know the history of britain britain was conquered multiple times the first peoples there were subjugated they were forced to live in new ways their culture was destroyed it was a cultural genocide what is now called english is not native to britain it is the language of the conquerors it was brought by the anglo saxons it is ancestry is germanic not the native languages that have been pretty much wiped out in what is now called britain gt on the other hand the usa has invaded panama haiti grenada and kuwait technically iraq ah you left out afghanistan also we have had some police actions in plenty of other countries have you heard of vietnam and korea in conclusion you are the result of you ignorance garbage in garbage out garbage aptly describes you firstly i never said it had been sold but it was pressured into being sold the only reason it was not was because the us got distracted by the funny orange man impeachment allowing tiktok to resume business as usual in the usa until now thankfully secondly it has been almost a thousand years since 1066 if we are counting that as cultural genocide then i think a good 90percent of nations on the planet have had genocide committed in them a tad bit dramatic and finally you are one sick mother fucker if you are defending the taliban just as a heads up even china is in the war against terror also you asked me about invasions in the last 50 years not beyond that however the point of the invasion remained the same a communist revolution disrupts a peaceful capitalist democracy and the usa is asked by the legitimate government being threatened to help fight against it if defending the usa makes me garbage so be it however i cannot imagine what kind of cess pool of a person you are that you are outright defending the actions of the taliban and chinese communist party first off then why did you bring it up other than you like to bring up pointless things second you implied that you are from britain are you not if so then how can you not know of the people that still feel oppressed by the conquerors and are trying to break free i only lived in the uk for a while and that was obvious are not many of the scottish the welsh and of course the n irish wanting to be free and finally when did i defend the taliban point that out do you ever get tired of making up shit yes what china is doing is done in the name of the war on terror wow i am honestly shocked you know that so how come we are angels when we do it but they are the devil when they do it no defending the us does not make you garbage doing so based on your made up garbage facts is what makes you garbage that is what people like the taliban do you know the people you bring up all the time you sound like someone is who smitten i think the taliban are just like you garbage i brought it up to demonstrate that tiktok was not abiding by the regulations set out by the us government also other nations in the uk are able to leave whenever they want after holding a referendum that says their general population wants to leave however that has not happened there is no one being oppressed by conquerers as far as we are concerned for the most part i thought we were the ones doing the oppresing ah you forgot afghanistan here i assumed that you hold a very negative view of the us interference of the taliban regime and therefore assumed you staunchly supported the taliban because for what other reason would you oppose an invasion that gave women and education in afghanistan for a very considerable amount of time china is genocide of uighur muslims is not a part of their war on terror do keep in mind this is the largest scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since world war ii i heavily doubt that the ccp would need to conduct something like this to prevent terrorism and i would love to know which statements i make are made up garbage gt i brought it up to demonstrate that tiktok was not abiding by the regulations set out by the us government when has the us ever accused tiktok of not abiding by us regulations link please the fear is that they are abiding by chinese regulations too that is the problem so you demonstrated something you made up gt also other nations in the uk are able to leave whenever they want after holding a referendum that says their general population wants to leave lol that requires them to get permission from the uk to hold a referendum it is like asking your captor for the key to your cell gt ah you forgot afghanistan yeah because that is a country you forgot to say we invaded did the us not invade them gt here i assumed that you hold a very negative view of the us interference of the taliban regime and therefore assumed you staunchly supported the taliban which sums you up you assume you make things up to you facts are just your feelings gt china is genocide of uighur muslims is not a part of their war on terror lol you just said it is because it is there are muslims all over china all over why would they just pick on muslims just there and no where else there is history there but i am not surprised you do not know about it gt and i would love to know which statements i make are made up garbage all the ones you just made look at your last post all made up garbage a google search will give you plenty of articles to back up my claims here is just one i will fetch 10 more if you need me to it is true you need permission from the government to hold a referendum the last time anyone did they voted in favour of staying in the uk the us did invade them but if you do not think the taliban is a good thing then there is absolutely nothing wrong with the invasion it is just pointless to bring it up that is all i know about the history and the terrorism present in that region however i do not think the incarceration of more than one million muslims without any form of legal process by the way helps to deescalate terrorism in the region without ruining the lives of countless communities and families just to bring the two of us back to reality real quick we are debating world politics on a subreddit for vr headsets we should probably find some middle ground and draw this to a close as we have gotten very far off track let me explain my viewpoint i believe that chinese influence in western tech markets is a very bad thing due to the current authoritarian regime in power there i believe that china controls companies like tencent and bytedance using them to collect data for espionage something china is well known for doing a lot of you explain yours and we will see if we can agree on something because i do not think either of us want this wall of text to keep descending edit just realized the ft article is subscriber only let me find another rq edit 2 alright new article is there yeah no we better quit it before the mods catch on rule 1 says no politics gt a google search will give you plenty of articles to back up my claims here is just one i will fetch 10 more if you need me to gt where in that article do they say that tiktok violated any us regulations that is what you claimed they did what it says is that us regulators are concern that tiktok is following chinese regulations which is what i said so you just provided a link that disproved what you claimed and backed up what i claimed if you feel otherwise please quote where it says in that article says that tiktok violated any us regulation gt it is true you need permission from the government to hold a referendum the last time anyone did they voted in favour of staying in the uk that was under the fact that the uk was in the eu scotland voted to stay in the eu since if they had separated from the uk then they would no longer be in the eu we both know what happened after that vote and ever since many people in scotland feel misled i think we can both agree that brexit is a material change with such a change why not let scotland have another referendum they want it but britain will not allow for it gt it is just pointless to bring it up that is all facts are not pointless gt i know about the history and the terrorism present in that region however i do not think the incarceration of more than one million muslims without any form of legal process by the way helps to deescalate terrorism in the region without ruining the lives of countless communities and families how many millions did the invasions of afghanistan and iraq effect all in the name of the war on terror not to mention all the other countries in the region that were destabilized in the end did any of that deescalate terrorism in the region it sure did ruin and take the lives of countless communities and families gt let me explain my viewpoint i believe that chinese influence in western tech markets is a very bad thing due to the current authoritarian regime in power there i believe that china controls companies like tencent and bytedance using them to collect data for espionage something china is well known for doing a lot of my viewpoint is that your viewpoint is based on no offense this time ignorance you think the relationship chinese companies have with the chinese government is vastly worse than the relationship between us companies and the us government when the truth is they are pretty much the same yes the chinese government has access to the data of chinese companies similarly the us government has access to the data of us companies one big difference is that a chinese company can tell you they gave your data to the chinese government a us company does not dare do that under penalty of a prison term since what accompanies a demand to a us company for it is data by the us government is often a gag order they are not allowed to discuss it in the eyes of the eu china is less of a threat than the us since the eu has seen fit to take action against facebook in the ruling they specifically said they were concerned about us government surveillance using data gathered about eu citizens on the other hand china is privacy law pipl is so similar to europe is gdpr that it is colloquially known as china is gdpr as i have said i am pro privacy so far from defending china on data gathering i condemn it but and this is what separates you from me i acknowledge that the us does the same i condemn that too i condemn both you condemn one while at the same time defend the other for doing the exact same thing yeah but america doesnt have literally prison camps where they force you to work to death what you are doing is basically oh im gonna dismiss everything the guy said and point out how america did oopsies too i do not think this method works tho genocide is always bad just because america did it to does not make chinas crimes less awful i guess you did not read where i said that the us has more people in prison than china what do you think all those people do while in prison eat bonbons and watch soaps on tv they work its not optional labor in us prisons is mandatory in fact the us government sells prison labor as a product imprisoned with forced labor is not that what you are talking about here is where you can order your own prisoners to do labor directly form the us government many states also run their own websites to sell prison labor in state prisons gt just because america did does it to does not make chinas crimes less awful fify i do not really care dude and im not reading your post china is doint bad stuff and ameria is doing bad stuff but i do not see your logic by comparing so you comment on things you do not read and you do not care so why did you post then are you trying to justify an evil with another evil wtf you should acknowledge both problems i agree but do not try to excuse the chinese government i absolutely am not i do acknowledge that both have problems when have i excused the chinese government perhaps you should direct your ire at the people trying to excuse other governments by ignorantly bringing up china as the bogeyman gt the last thing the tech industry needs is a dictatorship getting it is foot into it probably a bit late for that as others have said everything is pico meta microsoft valve literally anything is a security threat to a high degree you are actively signing up to share your data that is how these companies make there money if you thought that the price was too good to be true whether that be a gbp300 vr headset or a free app like tiktok that is because it is they are going to spy on you whether legal or not gt valve last time i checked they do not monetize data they do literally every company that can gather data on you does we have gotten to a point where it would be idiotic not to this is the world we asked for with our votes and our money do not get all political does not matter who you vote for or where you money goes it will all end the same besides not everything balances on america valve technically monetizes data by seeing what games you play and for how long then showing you similar games in hopes you buy it but that is just a standard thing for storefronts and is arguably a good thing if you see a chinese company as more of a threat than an american country you should really ask yourself who is more able to do something nefarious with your data what can china do to you not a lot this whole fearmongering about china is just yellow peril red scare 2 0 do not fall for it how blissfully ignorant you do realize that china is vast grasp over the data of almost the entire us population allows china to track the locations of government employees build dossiers for blackmail conduct corporate espionage and even more i agree it is definitely a no no if you are a government employee but you got any of that proof that they are actually doing all of that do not forget any device the chinese have access to with a mic most likely has recorded ssn birth date wedding date family member names bank account info voice to text and ai parsing of logs can make a lot of data fit in a relatively small amount of storage space it is not just gov officials they track anyone might run into a person of interest just think of how 20 people in a coffee shop with the chinese monitoring their phone mics can pick up a lot of info about people that are harder to track gov officials a cell phone microphone can pick up a crazy amount of background sounds over a pretty long distance how many movies have been made where someone does something to someone else and then says i am sorry they made me do it they were going to hurt blackmail is some serious stuff and can be hard to figure out why something happened later on one more a lot of people speak their passwords out loud softly how many gov agency hacks were performed using valid credentials you do not need social engineering anymore just time patience and access to someone is phone or vr headset or tv you are thinking about potential and being incorrect it is the internet you think proximity matters but you are forgetting motive north american corporations are exploiting us but they still care about north american economics and stability unless they plan to side with china the ccp would benefit from north american chaos and destabilization why would they not encourage that that is what it comes down to it would benefit them if it occurred they have the power to encourage it they would thin it is stupid not to therefore they are making efforts to destabilize radicalize and stupidify north american populations like seriously we already know they have been meddling in our actual governments our governments have finally admitted to it and you know they would lie to deny it for as long as they could we would have to be pretty stupid to not realize they are been attempting to meddle with our psychology through our economics as well given pico is owned by a social media company i would fully expect they are scraping usage data of various things and collecting it but as you are not a chinese national or resident does that really matter to you personally if it does then do not buy one just know that meta is doing the exact same stuff do you think their link software could be going through my files on pc or monitoring my keystrokes and sending them away that is my concern seriously doubt it if it was someone would have pretty easily found out by now something like that would be hard to hide and chances are at least one person inspected there software with a reverse engineering tool by now any time you are running an app on your pc you are trusting what its doing but it very well could be doing almost anything in the background the oculus app is notorious for chewing up cpu cycles even when your vr isnt turned on wtf is it doing i wonder i have not heard similar reports on pico is software but the nature of software is that it evolves over time the answer today does not necessarily apply tomorrow computers are never the same tomorrow as they were today unless you keep them in an offline state personally i would not use any bytedance product though if you have blocked it from the internet and use virtual desktop to stream your pc then you should be fine i use it for pcvr just connect it launch pico link software and then steam ah i do not really know if the pico link software has any out bound connections it should not need to but this is the same company that owns tiktok which was found collecting data from other apps on your phone i do not really see if anyone has done any research on this but you could probably check if you know how to use wireshark well i have it blocked in firewall so it can not connect to the internet i know it tried to update itseld but that is all the connecting i saw from it do you think pico and let is say lenovo is on the same level do not know about lenovo other than that the yoga laptop i had in college came pre loaded with a bunch of bloatware i re installed windows without any of that shit well ofc it is we just do not know how pico is not like meta meta is all about money bytedance is all about control in general security threats depend on who you are like if you half homless no life nerd trust me china can spy on you a lot and is still no security threats we do not recommend using the app to persons of interest who hold high level political public or decision making positions are you such a person if not then china probably does not care about spying on you gt we do not recommend using the app to persons of interest who hold high level political public or decision making positions do you mind sharing the source for that quote would like to look that up to share with a person of interest the u s government does not allow tiktok on government devices so i think pico should also be blocked thanks the quote is from the linked article in the op lol this thread is riddled with prc plants just regurgitating how if you are not chinese and living in china it is no problem facepalm they are not alone in their opinions pico is owned by bytedance and the ccp realistically using them is not going to make a difference on your day to day life at all they are probably spying on you but so is everything else the nsa likely has a backdoor built into your computers cpu or could spy on you through a secret windows exploit a potential threat but nothing has been confirmed so far from what i have seen of the neo3 it is a lot of copy paste from the reference goertek design and some open source stuff development of it started before the bytedance acquisition so it is possible they never got around to implementing anything nefarious pico 4 may be different well there were some updates of sw during the time of the owning will it help that it is the pro variant for bussiness or it will make it worse i use it solely for pcvr i do not have a clue it is a black box that is right thanks anyway really good question and worth investigating though not sure how to do that the only real threat is chinese companies chinese goverment expanding into everything i have pico 4 here in czechia got it coz i just can not stand fresnel lenses all your important stuff is already stolen ss drivers license credit and medical info if you have not and can freeze all your credit bureaus best and cheapest id theft short answer yes obviously like everything else long answer are you a high level government espionage employee no then no extra long answer are you worried about unsavory companies advertising to you in insidious ways yeah that is gonna happen no matter what do you have self restraint and the intellectual ability to make decisions for yourself no you do not but if you did it would not be a problem crazy stuff i searched for an rtx 2060 on the ebay app last week and the next day my google feed had 2060 articles in it my youtube feed had 2060 related videos i do not use the app but a browser other than chrome to view yt i even got notifications from offer up about 2060s i guess i can expect the google stuff using g an android phone but how the freak did offer up know your phone is a security threat quest 2 actually weights less than a rift s 503 grams vs 563 grams so the issue is that the quest 2 default strap is absolutely awful and also that the quest 2 weight is entirely concentrated at the front of the headset if you buy a halo strap for it like bobovr m2 plus pro you will get an improvement in comfort and ergonomics but if you still want to get a new headset for non standalone other than bigscreen beyond i can only think of the reverb g2 it is very good in terms of visuals and it seems to be comfortable however it is tracking is a bit finnicky and windows mixed reality will be discontinued starting from 2027 so i do not recommend you get one at this point pimax crystal that someone recommended is not only pretty expensive but is one of the heaviest headsets available it weights almost a kilogram it is main target audience are people who seek the best possible image quality not comfort maybe a good option for a high res headset with very good comfort is the pico 4 it is an all in one headset that weights just a bit more than the rift s 584 grams vs 563 grams but it is extremely well balanced since unlike the quest it is battery is located at the back of the headset so it will probably be even more comfortable to wear than a rift s pico 4 weights only 295 grams at the front just buy an amvr face pad for the pico 4 default one is a bit hard and you will have a very comfortable headset for pcvr that has pancake lenses and a resolution similar to a quest 3 here is a review of someone who owned a rift s and got a pico 4 it seems he found pico 4 to be a bit more comfortable to wear than the rift s hi everyone just wanted to say thank you for all the great suggestions so far also for the information that rift s and quest 2 are actually similar weights but it is the head strap the makes the difference i am definitely appreciating the 3rd party head strap suggestions as well yea get a head strap for sure i legit do not understand how anyone even remotely wears a q2 with the native head strap as it was an instant no for me i did not go bobo i went kiwi it the comfort straps that come with a built in battery pack balance the weight nicely it is definitely more about weight distribution than just raw weight the quest 3 is slightly heavier than the quest 2 yet it is way more comfortable i can highly recommend the bobovr m2 for the quest 2 it is what i used before i upgraded to the quest 3 and it made it very comfortable primax crystal quite expensive but great quality supposedly pico neo 3 link cheaper fresnel but with displayport has standalone mode also also pico has bland colors there is also dpvr e4 but i would rather get pico tbh it is sad how few displayport inside out options we have based on ops post he is looking for a light headset unless i am very wrong the crystal is notoriously known for being heavy ah right yeah primax is a helmet big headsets like the valve index 800 grams or varjo aero 750 grams are usually very front heavy pimax crystal weighs 850 grams but about 1 3 of the weight the battery is distributed to the back of your head making it less front heavy and feels lighter due to better weight distribution and balance but the crystal is extremely bulky for its weight fun fact avp is heavier than the crystal if you include the battery 650 headset 350 battery yeah well when the battery is not on your head it could weigh 1kg for all i care weight distribution is very important indeed but weight is still weight i use the bobovr s3 which also has a battery in the back so it balances the q3 weight and still you feel it balanced heavy is better than front heavy but light is better than both yeah also great quality and pimax in the same sentence makes me cringe a bit also terrible build quality one of my friends has one and whenever we are playing vr together all anyone can hear is his headset creaking also crystal is technically an all in one no company named primax makes vr hardware loool i legit thought it is primax d you are right the hp reverb g2 though i would not get one since it seems to be on life support now i am interested as well i own a q3 and have tried several different comfort kits but at the end of the day it is a heavy headset i would have gotten a beyond myself but it requires both base stations and index controllers not to mention people are saying the sweet spot is small so you have to move your head instead of eyes which i cannot go back to using my q3 i hope we will get some in the next couple of years but i wouldnt hold my breath the beyonds sweet spot is dependent on cushion depth but you basically need your eye lashes to touch to fully get the max fov and best possible edge to edge clarity if they made a headset that was even over double the weight with q3 fov and and edge to edge clarity i would buy it in a heart beat but the small form factor limits that of you are doing room scale things it is a bit easier to overcome anything seated it is a bit more noticable that you are constantly moving your head ahhh exactly it is so sad that there is not a pcvr headset without compromise i wish there was a headset that has everything and the only downside is being expensive the beyond really went as light as possible but the hit you take for clarity and fov imo is not worth the compromise it is as you say if there was a headset slightly heavier than the beyond with better fov and clarity it was my first choice too that is where the tech is unfortunately nothing can be done without compromise the quest 3 sort of feels like the absolute compromise headset with the exception of it is lenses everything about it is mediocre to okay comfort for anyone with a wide head is atrocious though i had a beyond but the small size meant very short perceived focal distance with gave me eye strain it made the other shortcomings a bit too much to bare for me personally if someone made a headset with 2500 3000 pixel oled displays with index q3 fov and the edge to edge clarity of a q3 audio from a valve index in a package that weighed in the ballpark of a q3 or index i would be happy to shell out a lot of money wireless would be a nice bonus but not a requirement well that is basically the mythological deckard too bad it is only rumors so far i am pretty much in the same boat and there is just fucking nothing i would get the crystal if it was not like 1 2kg supposedly dpvr are working on a high end headset so there is a sliver of hope there i guess if you are on windows 10 and do not need to upgrade to 11 any time soon and you are fine with very subpar tracking you could just get a used g2 it is super comfortable and the image quality is great dpvr e4 the immersed visor should be coming out this year weighs about 200g has 4k per eye screens with passthrough inside out tracking and wired wireless capability according to their ceo demos should be happening in q2 of this year gt rift s back and i figured i would give it a spin i was instantly amazed by how much lighter it was compared to the quest 2 something is weird in this story rift s weight with headstrap 590 g quest 2 weight with headstrap 503 g just get a better headstrap bobovr for better comfort and weight distribution or use this website to find a headset that will suit your needs based on other replies i have seen i think that it may really be the head strap thank you for the link as well it looks like a great resource i can recommend the kiwi design head strap i have the one with battery so substantially heavier than a vanilla quest 3 but so much more comfortable and more than 4 hours of playtime bobo vr headstrap does seem a little more solid but i got my headstrap with battery for less than the bobo vr headstrap without battery  fair point but there is no doubt that the rift s hardware is much lighter for not having to actually generate graphics the way that a quest 2 does mostly i am looking for a light headset and having a full processor inside of it makes something heavier what just get a quest 3 who cares if it can function as a standalone device it does wireless pcvr very well i think not needing base stations implies inside out tracking which kind of requires the hardware that comes with a standalone headset pimax crystal does not require base stations but is wired and is extremely heavy it is not what op is looking for i think the only headset with trackers around the room is the oculus cv1 you seem to want a headset with lighthouses also known as base stations since you do not want a headset that can track itself read the title again the rift s is still over 500 grams similar in weight to the quest so it is probably the weight distribution of it sitting on your head that gives the illusion that it is a lot lighter but really it is negligible how the strap distributes the weight across your head is the important part here there are many third party strap options for the quest that will help with that the quest 2 is issue is mostly weight distribution instead of the actual weight i would probably try a used quest pro or pico 4 instead since they have better weight distribution you can also try a quest 2 3 with a third party headstrap not much else really the xr4 is absurdly expensive and does not work well with vr games and the crystal is 1kg i should add that all two quest 2 is we have in my house and my quest 3 are all being used with bobovr halo straps and batteries it is very comfy and well balanced i do not even notice the weight i do not even wear it with the facial interface on so my face can breath i got the pimax crystal on sale from amazon for dollar1223 us bout 3 weeks ago which was a steal i thought it is been my daily ride i still have a quest but for pcvr my pimax crystal is always my go to i am not going to list all the pros because it blows away headsets that i have used i have used rift quest2 3 the main one though is the display port and my usb3 2 port keeps my battery 100percent charged after hrs of use granted quest headset always fully charged too displayport means i am getting uncompressed video no fussing bout with encoding decoding and bit rate settings in oculus tools etc one sweet thing though i didnt think bout it has a switch where you can choose between standalone and pcvr mode i missed this so much from the rift i always hated that bs with the quest where it starts in standlone it annoys me greatly and i missed that feature from the rift so much it feels so good to have a pcvr dedicated headset i cannot stress how great it is to be free of quest link but if you not willing to step up to this price i get just grab a quest 3 its a great headset for the price the weight is fine after hrs of use but yes when i put on my quest headset i can not lie i am amazed how much lighter it feels if you want pcvr go with pimax crystal it is just not close whatsoever 4k per eye dynamic foveated rendering 200 nits light dimming etc but if you do not have a mid range pc just go quest 3 for standalone citravr etc also i always play wired if you want to play wireless i do not think pimax crystal has that yet also we lack passthrough atm something to think bout i got an aftermarket strap with rear battery in my old q2 and although it added weight to the headset it was balanced better and more comfortable the hp reverb g2 is really good in terms of resolution and is inside out tracked but wmr is officially deprecated so the future of the headset is up in the air and it is not looking good if you are happy using windows 10 do not care about upgrading to windows 11 and are fine replacing the headset in a couple years the hp reverb g2 is probably the best bet if you can pick one up for cheap the main downsides to the g2 is the controller tracking is slightly worse than the quest2 and windows mixed reality platform is not as popular as vive index oculus and therefore not as well supported by software if your main usage is simracing or similar the g2 works great if you just want more resolution you could also get a quest 3 with a nice headstrap hey guys is index worth buying in 2023 kinda sorta the base stations and controllers are good i would recommend them with the bsb if you can afford it ok that was a joke lol but thanks for the answer i have had index since launch and got q3 a couple months ago there is a way to make knuckles work with q3 using index as a dongle but i did not have enough time for it and q3 controllers are not that bad i think my next quest upgrade will be pro controllers ya backstreet boys put on a good show used for the right price yes new no its 2024 it is 2017 i picked a complete index kit second hand from ebay last week for gbp540 only used for 10 hours and looks brand new i would not buy one full price though headset itself not at all the base stations and controllers are if you want to pair them with a crystal bsb the upcoming somnium and maybe avp seems like some have got that to work now only if it had pancakes yummy lmao nothing else comes close in terms of audio quality especially without headphones touching your ears there is also no other headsets that can do 144hz which is a very noticeable upgrade over 120hz in fast paced games or if you are moving your head around a lot it is also got a larger fov than any other headset on the market right now basically if you care more about peak pixel density and resolution then get a bigscreen beyond with index controllers and lighthouses if you care more about smoothness audio quality and immersiveness get an index full kit it is been out for a few years now so you can get used kits for a decent price if you do not mind potentially having to clean someone else is face gunk off of it gt nothing else comes close in terms of audio quality especially without headphones touching your ears yes bmr drives which you can literally buy for dollar15 and plug into the headphone port of the quest me and my cv1 skating by unharmed b a few friends of mine bought cv1s for euros50 euros80 used to play alyx i do not think you can compete with that level of bang for buck going from cv1 to an index was a huge letdown for me still using it instead to this day wish there was a headset like it in terms of weight and controllers while having more fov and pixels would tick all the boxes for me literally the quest 3 of you do not care too much for the oled displays very similar controllers higher fov more pixels better edge to edge clarity no god rays downsides it is heavier 470g cv1 without cable vs 660g quest 3 with elite style headstrap no perfect blacks and controller tracking might be worse depending on how many sensors you used on the cv1 now the additional 190g do not feel like it because it is closer to your face and there is no cable tugging on the headset the controller tracking can be just plain better than cv1 if you go for the pro controllers and the blacks yeah you can not do anything there oh man yeah an updated cv1 cv2 would have been bonkers the hp reverb g2 was a good try but missing the oled and the controllers were shite me missing my dk1 and dk2 that i stupidly sold i miss my cv1 man you forgot all of us wmr mofos getting dropped by microsoft in about two years hopefully bsb 2 0 will release by then though with some further qol updates edit guys call me coping but microsoft clearly states that by not updating to the new update slated this year we can use wmr headsets until 11 06 26 about two years from now and 11 06 27 if you are on windows 11 enterprise or other commercial version of the os there was an announcement from microsoft that they remove support in windows 11 24h2 update and recommend staying on 23h2 and installing only security updates if you want to still use wmr headset i am still staying on windows 10 way less hassle with vr bsb i have got a hp reverb that i have attached to my media center i would like to see it remain usable but also if there is no support will it really remain usable for much longer anyway exactly what i was going to say wmr on linux looks promising at least they only need to figure out the controller tracking gt only only controller tracking from what i see monado supports experimental 6dof tracking for the headset but only with external systems i imagine that means outside in is that right so inside out seems to be another thing it does not support yet idk i saw this i am not an expert so i may just not understand it properly no it supports camera based inside out tracking for the wmr headsets and rift s but no persistent play spaces yet and it is not as good as the tracking on windows right now controllers are only 3dof right now but there is also very very flaky hand tracking the monado homepage means external by it is just a second piece of software that does it monado is fork of basalt i guess there is some implication from that there was some intention to merge the slam tracking into monado itself eventually but it does not seem like that is still the plan from what i gather i am not a developer on the project i just use it and lurk in their discord p gt wmr mofos getting dropped by microsoft in about two years actually they already dropped it two years from when they bought it not two years from today the hp reverb g2 launched in late 2020 microsoft laid off the wmr dev teams in early 2023 so a little over two years pico 4 user been happy with their headset because everything is balanced as thing should be pico 4 is legit for the price ui ux and the store who tf uses standalone on it it is mainly a pcvr base for modding the answer to your question is i am sure somebody exactly you are buying something and not even using half its function why should i use standalone when it is better on pc and my hardware mods do not work on standalone well if you do not wanna lug your pc around if you travel granted pico probably does not have the standalone support either that quest does but i tried my buddies quest 3 recently after being strictly pcvr and it is a game changer especially the exclusives i have been missing out on damn no rift s meme as a rift s owner i feel ya even the meme forgot about me lol i bought one in 2020 literally a couple months before they stopped supporting the oculus store on it i still have my headset and controllers sold the cable for like dollar100 two years ago are we missing out on what steam has all the vr games and the up to date gpu handles everything i mainly just want better resolution tbh screen door effect with the rift s can be annoying plus the passthrough is not that good cue picture of a child playing with a snes in 2024 something like rift s users begging for support less than 3 years after release rift s was a good headset for dollar400 but the speed which they dropped support for it is criminal op does not know what a rift s is they are new to vr op could not hear the rift s users through the robotic screeching coming from their mics either that or all their cables died happened to me after 6 months never bought another one no as fittingly op forgot about them p the controllers for the index are the one thing i still absolutely love i did not buy the headset only the controllers and i used them with the vive for soooo long before getting a quest 2 i still use my quest 2 and wish i could use them with it they are the best controllers ever made you can use them with the quest 2 though how it only works for pcvr but you do get your knuckles back with your q2 you need to buy a couple of dongles there are quite cheap and good alternatives to the valve dongles and install a free steamvr app i assume this does not work for the quest 3 edit well i am very happy to be wrong it does with pcvr oh i only saw people talking about quest 2 in the thread above and made an assumption thanks it does also with a wide range of other non lighthouse headsets has the details along with some of the issues quest headsets can see drift if you move around the room a lot as far as im aware this works with practically any vr headset on steam that doesnt natively use lighthouses ive seen it with quests rifts and wmr we need you to notice our eye and face tracking there are dozens of us i swear guys the new valve headset is just around the corner guys for real this time the deckard is almost here i swear valve is just waiting for me to buy the index time to take one for the team yeah along with half life 3 with vr mode as a launch title what is the symbol after half life i am confused it was a sarcasms i meant the long awaited rumored third installment in the series again the word after rumored i do not get it valve 3 third not making any sense plenty on a more serious note tho people were making the same jokes about the rumored apple headset and now look where we are i have not given up hope yet apple vision pro users trying to do anything on a dollar4000 device they can not wym i installed an ad blocker it is a real computer next up will be an irl adblocker for the pass through lol it is my paperweight whatcha talking bout it recently got to boot on steam vr i only know this because my friend never stfu about apple it is infuersblely annoying even when beat literally complains about playing a game streaming when they are streaming on apple it is got the hardware yeah android is more reliable look at retroid infuersblely that is gotta be a brand new typo genuinely impressive i literally woke up when i commented and was having puppy troubles z z i am still tired no need to justify it it happens i am confused and guessing it is because i did not get a crystal until recently and avoided some early release mess but pimax crystal auto adjusts ipd and guides you to the sweet spot automatically in lt 6 10 seconds and i am confused why it is black the crystal is notorious for having lots of connection problems even still to this day i would assume that is why the meme is black my pimax crystal has issues where it would spontaneously disconnect mid game and close the game in the process i would not dare use the crystal in a sim racing league where it can suddenly shut down your game in the middle of a race i thought it means there are no pimax crystal users cv1 users unscathed we assumed they died of old age by now this was mostly more modern vr headsets i will make more slander memes for other headsets dw also cv1 users still existing goes hard may i suggest a joke about the headset rig any mobile headset user has to make for optimal ergonomics playtime and body tracking windows mixed reality users after windows 11 update ah wait really i was thinking about getting one on ebay as a cheapo play vr with me yeah wmr is getting the axe in a future win11 update they are removing it completely in next windows major update bsb does not have great fov tho fov is nice for sure but the screen clarity speaks so much stronger and continuously whereas fov i forget after awhile and i came from an index bsb users not able to use their headset since bs fucked up their measurement that was me it was about a week or so without it it was rough going back to index and when it came back correctly sized glorious as a vr dev index is still my favorite hardware to develop for mobile processing power sucks excuse me my quest 3 lasts for 1hour and 45 that is an hour 15 longer than mine lasts j i get maybe 6 or 7 out of it with the bobo vr2 strap i do not have a strap yet mine does not die that quick tho definitely longer then 30 mins my quest 3 has not died once while playing but i primarily use it connected to my pc i also do not play more than 45 minutes in one go lol yeah but my brain melts after 30 mins 6 months in i get nauseous thinking about vr i thought that is what they were referring to i still love it but ouch oh true i can play it for hours on end sometimes get a headache from the strap but that is about it i should also mention i have a severed retina in my right eye so i can not get motion sick it likely is the strap for me too actually a better one has been on my list pretty much since day 2 but i have not gotten around to ir yeah same they are abit pricy for me exactly the back end investment of time and money to really get into vr is more than i initially realized yes indeed i have considered with how good stand alone vr is getting selling my computer as i do not really play games on it anymore and pcvr is boring very real possibility i have been meaning to try steam link to play some pc games on it have you tried also i saw something about it being discontinued anyhow i have tried it yes i actually find game play smoother on stand alone the bobovr m3 strap is fantastic and on sale atm for dollar50 i am in australia nothing is that cheap looks like 86 for you but they are sold out of the m3 in aus currently still very worth it even at full aus price imo i adore mine as it makes longer sessions and workout sessions faaaat more comfortable and the battery pack is awesome for me the problem is the heaviness on the face and the pressure it puts on my nose forehead i even use the bobo vr 2 and it helps but not by much i can not really play longer than 20 30 min without my head starting to hurt and a slight head ache starting i hope future devices are significan notly lighter or in a form factor that it much easier to be worn for longer periods without getting that dumb red vr headset mark on my face i was a quest 1 user up until a few months ago upgrade to quest 2 i was a little less wise with my money quest pro was is the oled that made you choose the pro over q3 pretty much and i liked the idea of the eye and face tracking quest 1 user i have a quest 1 and it still works perfectly come at me my quest 1 is still kicking strong glorious lmao as someone who as used both the index and quest 3 yes the quest 3 is better without a doubt  better than q3 dark scenes being a grey blue fog oled master race i just tell myself it is more cinematic lens flare all of the things watch anything by jj abrahams and you can not tell which lens flare is baked in lol i mean your not totally wrong if only the index could be repairable then i would buy another one i am pretty stupid so what is the quest 3 meme referring to battery i do not have one but i am sure it can last over an hour fine i would like to know too wmr users after the next windows update as a vive user i have zero loyalty to htc i had to repair one of the jacks on my headset just after the support window ended they wanted something like dollar200 so i did it myself instead there were a ton of other horror stories about their support their own software was supposed to make it possible to see your android phone notifications within vr which would have been really useful except it never even kinda worked and the software instead tended to make steamvr unusable the vive was a pretty good headset and the fact that it came with controllers straight away was a huge plus cv1 originally released without controllers and only came with an xbox controller in the box along with oculus insisting rift is a seated experience it was a bizarre time lighthouse tracking was also unbeatable for years but yeah i do not care that there is not another good htc headset i have not upgraded because on the one hand it is very expensive to do so and on the other hand what you can do with the headset is still pretty limited if deckard ever comes out i will upgrade though same here a lot of the current vr systems would be an upgrade from my original vive but they are not big enough to justify the cost but i would love something as innovative with base stations and controls with a great screen bonus points if it is a valve product i am not that set on the lighthouses anymore inside out has come a long way which is to be expected after eight years early on other tracking systems rsiked nausea looking at you psvr1 but i think that is mostly a thing of the past at this point and i put up the lighthouses in my office which is often too filled with my various projects to easily clear for vr use so i would probably actually use a headset more if it did not rely on base stations the not enough of an upgrade thing is definitely a big part of it though the gpu market being awful for many years did not help thing either i finally upgraded from my 970 last year to a used 3070 for about dollar280 edit it was not dollar200 it was about dollar280 and i was not confident my 970 could drive the higher resolutions and framerates of an upgraded headset that is a lot of why i never went to the index at this point i would kind of consider the quest 3 but i can not get over my distaste for meta thus the interest in deckard i hate everyone equally energy he likes bigscreen beyond tho i like every headset i mentioned tbh even the crystal dude it is just a slander meme it is not that deep and it is meant in fun  well the sweetspot is in fact really fast to find if you use the ajust view settings that helps a lot to know if you put the headset on properly dialed the ipd according to your eyes having using it since lauch i can find it in like less than 10 sec even though white texts are still a little bit blurry in cinematic mode for me the sweet spot is not the more concern but the graining meshing texture due the low resolution besides that i still recommend to who have a ps5 bsb master race why am i even making this joke really the joke is on me as a quest pro user damn they got a master race for mid hope yall get better someday lmao pimax crystal yep pretty accurate to my experience with the crystal there is a pretty much 30percent chance that it just decides it does not want to connect to the pc and if it does there is a chance it will disconnect mid game and actually close the game in the process this is the reason why i can not do online sim racing leagues with the crystal slander me rift s haha quest3 users spot on that is how i feel after i game the whole battery capacity at once cardboard users d idk man big screen beyond had great visuals but i heard even tho it is super small it is one of the most uncomfortable headsets due to how where it sits under ur eyebrow and above your cheek bone lots of reports of it digging in and giving pain the only thing that makes the index better is no inside out tracking its the cause of so many deaths because of my controllers losing tracking coughs in the beyond is mid lol too many drawbacks in lens amp display they be glarin into the sun fr fr pimax crystal is garbage almalance made it better but is still mid support had to ship me two different cables and flash firmware using adb to get the software remotely close to working then the lighthouse faceplate start drifting away into the sunset bsb does still have pretty crap fov and sweet spot even with exceptionally stunning visuals the fact that bsb managed to use pancake lenses source insanely bright oleds to get around the loss of light from pancake lenses and still ended up with a less than perfect clarity situation with a noticeable sweet spot it is such a huge misstep if they had just put out a headset with a comparible res to quest 2 3 and oled panels then its the perfect headset but instead they made a headset to match their tiny brains it can not do full rez at 90hz only thing stopping me as a quest 2 user i am still happy with my headset and i do not see any reason to upgrade until at least quest 4 probably yeah same i am having fun i will let the dust settle until next generation or possibly the one after that i just got my quest 2 used i will wait til the 3 or pro or whatever reaches a price i want to pay i am very happy with the quest 2 sure he 3 and avp is better but whatever i got quest 2 new and it still delivers what i want for 3d gaming on stand alone or pc i would recommend splurging for quest 3 over 2 but 2 still does all i need to have fun yeah having used both a lot recently the only appreciable reason to upgrade is for the lens clarity every other improvement feels incremental but the lenses are a generational improvement imo passthrough is nice but more like a perk than a feature there are only a handful of worthwhile games that use the color passthrough to really improve the game most just make a gimmick out of it stuff like eleven table tennis actually use it amazingly allowing you to be sure you are not about to lunge into a piece or furniture or something going for a tricky shot same with thrill of the fight since you are throwing full force punches xr elite user best of all worlds and super lightweight and comfy to boot i only stream pcvr games though because their native storefront has a terrible selection stupid facebook keeping everything worthwhile exclusive i heard the optical stack was subpar compared to recent quest headsets have any insights on that give me dollar1000 and i will get a big screen beyond i do not get the psvr 2 one explain pls care to explain the quest 3 one psvr2 one yea im confused also lol my friend got big screen and she does not recommend it most because of the fov and the faceplace wearing out and u cannot replace it whatsoever she likes it but she does not recommend it over other choices you can certainly replace the face cushion there is not an option on the store yet but it is possible to contact support about it sorry bsb still has a cord i can not get past that i went untethered for a couple years but i do not miss those artifacts definitely a lot of pros to wireless but the bsb makes it more worth tethering imo i do not mind cords but quest 3 on wifie 6e connection with the hardware to push on vd is amazing basically no artifacts for me my bitrate was good but i do not have a 4090 so i can not use the vd special encoding even so i still like the bsb much more than my quest 3 i just like the colors the form factor the tracking i do appreciate the convenience and portability of quest though i just have a 4070 ti but i absoluterly agree i still have my oddyssey plus and quest 1 for oled i still love the psvr2 overall despite it is own drawbacks for me out of the box the least comfortable headset i have ever used and a very noticeable mura though less than psvr1 i like the brightness of my psvr2 and the controllers are probably my favorite out there same here best vr controllers i have ever used i like them more than the index knuckles controllers i am running a vive pro off a 1080 you do not need a 4090 i thought the special encoding feature for vd was exclusive to the 4090 might just be the whole 4000 series the vive wireless software runs just fine on old hardware it is probably different encoding than the quest not sure what you are referring to av1 codec it is not locked behind the 4090 i have a 4080 and use it it is only decodable by the quest 3 though maybe that is what you are thinking of the only thing that requires a 4090 is the godlike quality setting which is the highest level of resolution 3 1k per eye ultra is 2 7k per eye so the diminishing returns are real but if you happen to have a 4090 that can push that resolution in aaa games you might as well use godlike me as a beat saber user latency sucks even with wifi 6e right next to headset and computer who would play beat saber that way i care more about synthriders but i do not play rhythm games wired or streaming to each their own but i can not stand wireless can not even get over the link cable compared to raw displayport v2 has antennae whaaaaa im happy with my quest 3 you forgot the visor nailed it bsb for the win quest 2 meme actually works for everyone who has spent a good time using vr and they realize how little actually good content there is really bad memes just woeful you also forgot avp users xd that index one is spot on though i still see people trying to push it even though it is outdated and the same price today than it was 5 years ago i had totally forgotten about psvr2 it is funny how they try to force so much hype for ps hardware and then pass without fame or glory i do not own a psvr2 what is the sweet spot the lenses require you to have them perfectly lined up with your pupils otherwise everything is blurry if you are perfectly lined up with the sweet spot then the center is clear and the blur only creeps in from the edges like quest 1 2 but the psvr2 is notorious for having a really small sweet spot i used one for a day or so and it was pretty annoying compared to headsets with pancake lenses like quest 3 i still have not found a good reason to upgrade from my cv1 new devices just do not seem like a good enough upgrade for me similar for me until i know personally what it is like to use a headset with pancake lenses my aforementioned q2 is gonna serve me just fine 2160x2160 puts it on par with reverb g2 i am surprised it can stream that over wifi honestly  it hit streams a compressed image which is quite noticeable ingame thst being said it is apparently better than the quest 2 and mrtv has shown a pretty neat through the lense video of half life alyx it might be worth a shot i found out about pico 4 being released in china last week and talked to my friend who is in shanghai about it he then found a pico shop in shanghai and went over to try it out he said the headset feels much lighter in weight than the quest 2 and he said the images look much nicer as both of us have been quest 2 users but we are both getting tired of the weight and uncomfort of quest 2 we were looking forward to the quest pro then we found out about pico 4 which i had no knowledge about the pico headsets until now and since i need to get a new headset for work so i decided to go on taobao and got one and get it shipped to hk which is not one of the launch locations i have heard that the chinese version requires china id to purchase software from the pico store so i asked him to ask the store clerk for some information here is what he found out support steam vr need a china id which i do not have hk and taiwan cannot work we will see about that even if it works with pcvr i am happy it is 2449rmb for the 128gb one i think i will get the headset sometime tomorrow i will see maybe i will give it a review here once i try it out after i get it how would you go it is good i have another thread about my experience with the pico 4 you can check it out gt the best vr gaming headset not without dp it is not  yes it is i have one and i have shown repeatedly how good it is on the forums of the games i play and the flight sims i use brilliant with virtual desktop wireless do you have one i doubt it else you would not say these absurd things that just are not true not unless you had another agenda that seems to be a common thing people telling us how it is without even experiencing it  dp as in dick picks is this also the case for pico 4 pro yes well fuck another hmd with minimum ipd of 62mm why my index goes down to 58mm pico 4 goes down to 58mm there is just a warning under 62mm that it may be uncomfortable for some that is because the hardware only goes down to 62 but the software goes down to 58 ah good to know i might actually have to give one a try i know the pico 3 has the version with pc connection think the pico 4 will later have a version with dp or whatever i could not say it would follow their historical trend but they are under new management after the bytedance acquisition and they seem to be putting more energy into standalone vr this generation honestly unless the wire is killing you you are probably better off with the index for now it can not beat vive pro 2 wireless so no comparing a euros429 headset to a euros2000 vr setup is not really a fair comparison though vp2 wireless has zero compression or latency i love it i know right i am getting downvotes for truth i have used wireless on og since years ago i then upgraded to vp2 and used the adapter kit to fit it to the vp2 resolution bump is night and day if wigig 2 becomes a thing to stream the full resolution of vp2 at 5k 120hz i would be in heaven yep should be with us next 6 months but also gen 2 should have it built in next year interesting sauce apple sauce more source where you read this total guess based on the patent for the tech being approved almost a year ago also fun to read how playstation vr2 launch will supercharge games hope that happens too gotcha i seen that i thought something was actually announced or on the horizon we will see i dunno i went back to cable on cosmos elite because wireless adapter could not keep up with super sampling 5800x 3080 32gb ram it is was better than q2 vd for sure in latency but not heads above in image quality i dunno maybe i had a dud possibly also it hammers cpu and graphics power i doubt you have a dud as the other person said it is tough on cpus however i will say my performance increased noticeably when i ordered one of those custom 3d printed fan mounts from ebay i think it does have a thermal throttling problem as well i would recommend looking into it it you ever want to give it a second try it was pretty inexpensive too sure wish i had an extra pci e slot i have the vive pro wireless love the oled screen and the wifi quality obviously but i basically never touch it because it is sooo bulky and the lenses are very bad blurry everywhere apart from the centre i just play quest 2 and pimax 8kx for pcvr so i am getting a pico 4 for it being allegedly much lighter better lenses better res yes so wifi virtual desktop will be worse quality for sure but i am going to see if it is a trade off i can tolerate i do not understand what this has to do with my post i said vp 2 yeh i only have vp 1 is vp2 other than res that much better is it significan notly lighter and less bulky than vp1 and the wireless thing and the battery you have to put on your belt are the awful lenses the worst i have ever come across having owned almost everything else totally different and significan notly better than the vp1 if it is a completely different beast maybe i will look into it i am genuinely interested oh it is different in one major way actually it now no longer has the benefit of oled but yeh i would love to know how much better vp2 is for sure and i will maybe cancel the pico if this had beat saber it would be a no brainer for me if this had a displayport it would also be a no brainer now i am waiting for the upcoming business quest pro headset zuck played fencing on to see if that got a display port no beatsaber puts me off but it is such a graphically simple game i do not think using virtual desktop from a pc would be a problem assuming you have a pc correct me if im wrong the quest pro isnt supposed to be a gaming headset right ive seen rumors saying it is just an ar buisness headset and not a headset where u can play beatsaber gt merged reality and yet another ridiculous reality adjective is born ridiculous reality brilliant they just could not use mixed reality like every body from academics to devs have been using for years they just had to come up with their own term man so many headsets bring em the future the very near future is going to be awesome what are you looking forward to untethered vr that runs at silky smooth frame rates a field of view like we see in the real world and some sort of full body haptics like a light wet suit style thing so we can feel the virtual world that seems to be the inevitable place we are going soon followed by a more elegant solution where we can go full dive sao the matrix style vr it is exciting and even if we only get half of the stuff on my dream list i will be quite pleased what kind of games do you play constant full body massages with visuals  eve online and pok mon go are my current games but a little of everything from my old nes when i was 5 to current pc stuff the real world does not feel like gimmicky vibrations all over our body i do not see haptics being immersive at all besides sega a long time ago already tried to make an immersive haptics vest it sucked that is not the kind of haptic feedback i was talking about i agree that the silly little buzzing that some have tried is a ridiculous gimmick i am talking about actual electronic stimulation of never cells that trick our brains into feeling things like hot cold pressure roughness smoothness ect i do not have any clue how they might simulate g forces or lack of but i hope someone cracks that in particular since i am a bit of a sci fi nut  nerve cells take it up with google voice to text okay i would not consider that a very near future prediction the first two things you mentioned are likely to come very soon i am not sure how insane of a breakthrough you realize the other thing would be vr is small potatoes compared to the applications of a consumer product making people feel certain ways just through stimulating nerves that kind of tech is at least 10 years away the very near future is a rather subjective measure you are absolutely right i should have said optimistically within the next ten years well the other two i can see happening pretty soon though there are some arguments about limits in wireless bandwidth well if someone tried something twenty years ago and it sucked it will always suck especially when it comes to technology nothing ever gets better if it makes you feel any better some developers try to use haptics right now in the vive to make it feel realistic with the controllers vibrating when you hit a ping pong ball or shoot with a pool cue does not feel immersive at all to me they just need to give up on gimmicky vibrations it is a bad idea not immature tech i agree it is not brilliant but i think it is better than nothing for example in audioshield i would miss the vibration when i connect with an orb and some developers do it better than others have you seen the tactical haptics prototypes weighted feedback giving a much more realistic impression than just vibration i do not think giving up is the answer it just needs to improve i think we are 8 10 years off on the headsets alone no visible pixels full fov etc not sure about the haptics or even if there is a big enough market for it this headset needs to be combined with this hand tracker fine hand control in a videogame is soooooo desirable wow merged reality that is so 2016 maximized reality is where it is at now no warning philosophy stuff well thanks for leading me down a rabbit hole to lovely but incredibly time wasting article p if this ends up sub dollar1000 i would buy it i have a feeling that it is specs are not going to be up to par to drive anything at an even remotely high fidelity since it is all in one heat battery and power will all be a big issues probably will end up being a glorified youtube 360 video player like most smartphone vr sets are this is why i think smartphones in portable headsets are way better people are already upgrading their dollar700 1k smartphones every year might as well put them to use i can not see there being a huge market for people dumping that much cash on a dedicated mobile unit unless it is significan notly more powerful good to see a bunch of players in the game though all vr is starved for content at least psvr looks to get out of the gates with a lot to offer yup it is got the same issues as any portable computer depends on your definition of fidelity you can drive high resolutions and frame rates without huge computational power if you are willing to relax on realism and that is a perfectly fair trade off here nobody is assuming photorealism in the first few generations what we need is wireless vr rendered on a regular computer with low latency i e a high bandwidth channel not some overly fancy compression schemes over wifi not so much another gear vr but from intel and you can not use it as a phone and it comes out years late at the point where gear vr surpasses it transmitting video over infrared or 60ghz radio or something of that kind i do not think we will see anything like that for a while 60ghz wifi has the potential to be quite fast but not nearly fast enough heavy compression will still be necessary especially when you consider future headsets with a higher resolution i think that a decent compromise will have to be met you are going to have to have a cable connected to the headset no doubt however what that means could change i agree that putting all the hardware in the headset is just silly i do not see any reason why you could not put more of that hardware inside another portable device though a couple ghz bandwidth at 60ghz would be more than enough for with rudimentary compression 2 megapixels entirely uncompressed at 90 frames per second and 24 bits per pixel is only 4 3 gigabits of bandwidth which can be brought down several times with simple compression schemes that do not add latency really the ip data over wifi is just a wrong approach here what it needs is more like old time tv which transmitted an entirely uncompressed signal but with modern advances like simple compression methods used on gpu for textures for a 1080p headset sure unfortunately any headsets developed after technology like 60ghz radio technology becomes commonplace will likely have a much higher resolution current estimates for 60ghz transmissions put you at about 7gbit s that is not going to push a 4k signal at 90hz it is possible with clever compression techniques but i worry about compression artifacts while not bad they will be noticeable and you will always get a better experience with a raw signal over a cable this is the best tl dr i could make reduced by 58percent i am a bot gt amp quot anyone can take alloy hardware combine it with windows holographic and build a world class vr system amp quot intel ceo brian krzanich said gt in a brief demo at idf an intel rep wearing a project alloy headset was able to wander around the stage while at the same time navigating a virtual room gt it amp 039 s an important step for the future of vr and ar as great as the oculus rift and htc vive are they amp 039 re both severely limited by all of the wires required to connect them to pcs we already have a glimpse at wireless virtual reality with the gear vr but it looks like intel is going to push things even further with alloy version 1 6 91044 tl drs so far pms and comment replies are read by the bot admin constructive feedback is welcome top keywords alloy 1 intel 2 hardware 3 windows 4 vr 5 no mention of sulon q amd is all in one headset that is a lot less ugly i do like the distance limited representation of real world objects so this is the first example we have seen of actual merged reality is that what we are calling it now hololens magic leap for example are ar devices only not really amds sulon vr why do you say this hololens can already scan the room you are in allow you to walk between rooms and track your hand gestures because mixed merged reality is a mix of both ar and vr hololens has no vr capabilities not knocking on hololens though it is really amazing but it is not mixed reality ah so opacity is the technical sticking point here do not forget that with the hololens nothing comes between your eyes and the holograms projected not even hands which is a huge bummer i was waiting for google to do a similar thing using tango wow would be interesting too evaluate the processing power battery duration and this kind of specs but the premises are really awesome just hoping it will not be as expensive as the oculus or the vive not regretting my purchase at all just not willing to spend a high amount another time i have done it this time but i will not the next time it would be under the facial interface it totally would god i know they are going to fuck up vr somehow i hope they do not but i just have this feeling they can not fuck up something they invented silly you damn you right i can not wait for them to invent hand tracking and then the masses will say it is good enough and devs will start to ignore the controller setting back vr games by 5 years the apple way the chances of that happening would have been higher if the quest 2 did not exist the problem ther is let is say quest 2 has sold 10 million units that is a rounding error on the ammount of products that apple is pushing for if they are entering the market it is because they think they can make it main stream they are looking for 500 million which if that is 500 million vr headsets with no tracked controllers devs might push for that type of play do i think it will actually happen probably not but the idea it could is kinda the worry edit or apple is going extremely niche which is more likely due to the rumoured price i will not actually be worried about them doing anything stupid to upset the normal vr gaming industry for a while since the price is steep they are probably going for the enterprise market but the htc enterprise headsets are cheeper and use steamvr tracking so it is easier to develop it is not only rumoured that the price is extremely step but also that they will be making very few of them aka the blackberry of vr i confidently expect the entire headset frame to be made of tempered glass with gorgeous bevels the controllers will be made of diamonds so that if you the touch the headset with the controllers it will explode instantaneously literal diamond hands quite meme able at least omg they are totally gonna make it easy to break are not they so that we would have to spend even more money on repairs never mind the wire whoever is wearing this has prey eyes if we were in a more mainstream subreddit and not a tech savvy one like r virtualreality you would be getting downvotebombed by any apple fan smart enough to understand what you said and probably also by those who did not understand i just realised the implication lol i did not think about it until your comment i can not wait for the flood of people claiming apple invented vr i think people will not say that apple invented vr but people will definetly say they reinvented it or they saved vr they invented smartphones and laptops sorry do not forget the invention of the television apple tv apple invented conversation apple invented apples edit tim apple founded apple to invent apples get over it apple invented recursion apple invented recursion apple invented recursion apple invented the universe so that they could sell more devices steve let there be apple apple invented invention gt they invented smartphones honestly i do not like apple all that much but this might as well be true i owned loads of smart devices prior to the iphone xda is pda is psion devices various smart nokias crap all of them useless they were made by phone designers and they needed a computer maker to come along and obliterate the market i dislike apple but i respect what they did with the iphone because if devices still worked like pdas and smartphones from the mid 00s you would be paying by the minute to call someone via whatsapp on wifi  i still ha e many problems switching between 2 densities on osx part of the reason most windows apps suck at scaling is because the developers did not care or it was written before dpi was variable like xp era so much awful legacy software out there there are a few windows apps that switch dpi in a reasonable way but they are the exception  brought vr mainstream at quadruple the price i think you mean about 7 8x the price iphone 12 pro needed for installation with dongles sold separately and only the 12 pro unless you buy our dollar600 other dongle even if it sold way less people would still say this because it is what got them into vr i no longer allow reddit to profit from my content mass exodus 2023 mass edited with how is that reinventing anything the xtal hmd and other hmd is of that level allready offer eye tracked and foveated rendering 8k screens and 180 degree vision i tried one on 2 years ago that same year i also tried the pimax eye tracking add on buggy but was getting there there is nothing new about the apple hmd specs that we know so far it is going to be good because apple is good at the things that matter a lot for vr a light and ergonomic design that is going to feel comfortable for almost everyone low barrier of use reasonable curration of the eco system gt 8k screens actually the xtal hmd had two 4k screens that is nowhere close to the 8k resolution two 8k screens have four times more pixels only we do not know anything about apples screen other then 8k yet it could be one 8k panel for both eyes 1 panel is easier to work with manufacture wise easier to guarantee total parity between teh eyes lower power consumption less heat generation we do not know they will have 2 screens or 1 screen yesterday i saw someone comparing hmd resolutions to 8 texture resolution and saying that was going to be apples resolution we just do not know yet and even if then 8k screens still is not reinventing it is literally just installing the next expected step in display quality zero innovation all hmd makers are going to do it sure we have only heard about 8k screens in the apple hmd but that is not the point the point is you have not tried xtal hmd with 8k screens because it only had two 4k screens 8k 4 4k oh sorry i managed to miss your point my bad i no longer allow reddit to profit from my content mass exodus 2023 mass edited with they have not created any new technology other than inconveniently different data charging ports everything else is just an iteration on existing technology the reason apple is so successful is two reasons they do not take risks on new technologies samsung does that so no need for apple to risk seeing what works and what does not they also have some of the best marketing ever i have found that with apple the whole is often more than the sum of its parts they are very good at bringing technology novel or otherwise together in a way that works in a cohesive package they are not perfect but they serve a design obsessed niche that is not served well by the companies apple competes with i no longer allow reddit to profit from my content mass exodus 2023 mass edited with they like most big companies do not create new technology they buy it no usually they take existing technology and improve on it and then patent that they have actually invented very little a few years ago i remember a video that went through all of apples inventions and they found at the time apple hadnt actually invented anything just either improved on something already there or mixed two things together not that this is not also a good thing improvements on pre existing technology us very good saying they invent things is disingenuous by your logic the lightbulb was not an invention since it just mixed together the already invented wire filament and vacuum chamber all inventions are iterations on existing technologies to some degree i should have been more specific their inventions are not like taking two bits of technology and making something revolutionary like the lightbulb their inventions are pretty much the same as the original thing but with a bit of improvement and usually some first party stuff that means they can charge you for stuff like cables from them tries to go into this a bit making a differentiation between invention and innovation gt improved on something already there or mixed two things together that is what invention is no part of the definition of the word requires that any or all parts of the invention are novel if they are novel then what you are doing is science and they do that too btw samsung takes risks since when samsung milks the people by pushing old tech with a new fancy marketing and one gimmick and then abandon it as soon they can samsung is like apple just worse folding screens are hella risky nope you can call them as user caused damages if broken and anyways they get broken and you sell new phone again selling something that could destroy itself through normal use is absolutely risky it could devastate their brand name this is why the galaxy fold was recalled after review units were sent out no it is not apple has done that with their laptops for the past decade their watches for the past five years and several of their phone releases for the past decade yet people still think they are a quality brand of course it is risky but you do not understand now engineers are taught and ordered to design products that fits to specifications the specifications are done for the product lifetime expectation example electronics are given x hours of lifetime for at given electronic capacities voltage etc and engineers choose components that will fit the specifications nothing more everything is built for the specs and when the specs expected lifetime or usage changes device lifetime is lower samsung as anyone knows that mechanical display tilting is bad it is regardless done for a lot of devices as such mechanic is required be it a door hinge at home closet or car be it a mechanical hinge for laptop display or for a smartphone it does not matter they are designed to have x count of movement and that is it nokia designed micro usb connector one of the worst there is by purposely to go broken so new cables and new phones are sold apple got idea to glue a battery to smartphones so they can sell a new one tradition that has been carried to laptops and tablets devices are made more difficult to repair and serviced so much that you can not even touch your own machine without losing warranty and even worse any official repair service and parts purchase the whole point is to sell you a new stuff that you do not really need like the machine that has a flexible display so you do not have a split between displays really that is what people need if you really believe that the some kids mentality reviewers was reason to cancel the phone because they got broken in few days in their use then you seriously downplay all engineers and testing methods in the industry you do not seem to know that these companies has own testers human and machines but you believe that samsung did not test at all those devices to find out those problems but went to send them to public straight from the design phase without any testing when a phone is designed to have a battery that has charging cycles of 500 it last 18 24 months of normal use when you make a display that withstand 1000 1500 opening or closing actions it will come in days through when you have a kid playing around with the new toy there is no bad publicity there is but it is not the point samsung got more time in media and when they got a working model everyone remembers samsung and how things are fixed problems comes when some engineers are not listen but money and schedule goes first that is when discovery shuttle happens gt samsung does that so no need for apple to risk seeing what works and what does not it is a shame you are such a fanboy you can not see that samsung and apple are essentially the same company with a different name samsung oled is gaining popularity quick we need to confuse the public lets call our led technology qled samsung for the past 6 months lol apple so dumb removing the charger from the new iphone also samsung we are removing the charger from our galaxy s21 to reduce e waste do not get me started on how shitty samsung appliances are i hate apple as much as the next guy but pretending they are somehow superior to apple is a joke at best i did not say they are superior i said they are the ones that take risks on new technology apple is mickey mouse accomplishments amp x200b apple iie literally 40 years ago was a decent computer that was still a bit overpriced amp x200b pushed out steve jobs on a pointless power trip amp x200b made a gaming console that was such a failure that no one even remembers it existed amp x200b put their logo upside down because they thought their customers were too stupid to know which side of the laptop opened amp x200b made iphones with child slave labor amp x200b make worst designed laptops on the market heating problems parts failing constantly also make it the most expensive laptop on the market aside from uber enthusiast gaming laptops and make the warranty completely useless unless you pay an extra dollar200 for applecare which still gives you a worse warranty than other premium brands amp x200b brainwashed millions of people into ignoring all of their failures because message bubble turn green reeeeeeee judging from your quest 2 tag i take it you just like big mega corps that think they know what is best for the consumer if social media use just to game is fine for you i can see why apple is asshole approach to power cables and headphones inputs suits you so much what have they ever reinvented saved save for the original iphone who says these things i always see this joke but i have never seen apple or an apple fan claim to invent a thing that already exists exactly this joke is one of the most tired cringy jokes ever you see it literally every time some apple product is mentioned on reddit i no longer allow reddit to profit from my content mass exodus 2023 mass edited with well i have personally encountered the argument a few times about a few different products from apple people definitely say it but let is be honest there are completely uninformed people who shill like this for anything not exclusive to apple except the people who say these things i think a lot of people say that they redefine those products which they absolutely do like the iphone was definitely not the first smartphone but it was the first smartphone that really pulled everything together into an immediately compelling package and got it into the hands of consumers this v r sounds so awesome why did not anyone think of it before apple for real though i knew a few younger people who thought apple invented digital mp3 music with itunes who never heard of napster before that all vr prices are going to go up in price by dollar500 at least might be a good thing if quality is forced up too that depends as long as we have good cheap headsets still we will get to the point of better headsets but the actual changes will be much less noticeable while prices keep rising like smartphones we need those budget oriented devices aswell dumbass do not you know apple created uhhhhh the internet i thought they invented apples not did will then they go back in time to license the tech out to htc and luckey it will not be a flood of random people apple invents vr will headline their own marketing materials  gt i would 100percent rather have apple in the vr space than not in the vr space i am surprised to see that this is not everybody competition is healthy for any industry the only people that are against it are apple haters i am not even a big fan of apple and i see nothing but positives here more players in the vr game means more possible advancements i am all for apple in vr but they really need to be complaint with openxr standards and they need to play friendly with non apple ecosystem products do i suspect pc support hell no but stuff like fbt treadmills and just other stuff you can use to extend vr should be compatible this is apple they already ditched khronos other big standards opengl and vulkan and did their own thing with metal instead they will not be touching openxr their vr will be more proprietary incompatible stuff with the goal to drive people into their walled garden appstore that sounds more like ar than vr seeing nothing but positives they are another company that heavily pushes a walled garden exclusive approach not exactly great for everyone lol this is also explicitly a industry device at first a standalone device with a rumored msrp at 3k this is for studios companies and influencers its gonna be hella nice hella expensive and have a super low volume what it is actually going to do is drive attention into the space i could see apple messing up vr if they patent universal good technology buy out competition and make exclusive games for their incredibly expensive headset i doubt the apple headset will have much of a gaming focus it is just not in apple is dna to give a shit about games apple arcade has a couple of bangers but overall it is kinda half hearted and that is their best effort so far after the hilarious failure of the pippin and gamesprockets gt mainstream vr it is like dollar 3000  yeah it is apple dollar3000 will be for the 32gb version articles were updated around february 4 5th other sources now say there is two versions the dollar3000 prosumer enterprise one that will be similar to hololens and likely have heavier emphasis on ar and a more mainstream vr headset around dollar500 dollar900 with light ar features it will be more than the cost of the quest 2 but it is also early and the price may drop as the date of release is finalized i hate anything with a locked bootloader including ios devices and the oculus quest 2 but am still happy with any competition to the quest no matter how good or evil because that stops any single player from dominating too badly you have got to hand it to facebook though selling the rift s at 299 is worth having a fb account imo they are helping bring vr to the masses  if you are willing to exit the hivemind of facebook bad or just make a burner facebook then it is really not a bad deal so much this i do not even see the point of bringing vr to the masses that some people can not wait to see we have already got plenty of stuff to do in vr and many projects to come in a developping market why would people think it is a good thing if facebook make lots of people join their closed ecosystem right now i see more risks with the competitors giving up because they can not be competitive against the cheap headsets from occulus then with all the exclusivities they could pay we could be fucked hard the point is you dimwit it will bring more quality development due to bigger market and higher potential profits even if it would just be android development it would be enough but quest is bring the desktop usable headset count up as well oh you are very clever congratulation oh that is just basic economy but nonetheless nice of you to notice but what does basic economy says about companies not being able to compete against subsidized headsets from occulus which wins anyway thanks to what they earn with their closed ecosystem and every bit of intel they could gather with their headsets why would they invest in a market if there is already a well established powerful company selling good headsets for cheap do you really think there is absolutely no risk and that it is crucial that many more people join vr as quick as possible you are now describing console market only 2 real mainstream competitors both devices sold at a loss at least were in previous gens only difference is the vr is at the beginning with 1 10 if not less of the xbox ps market i do not care much about which company will be on top all i care is quality headsets with high ppd be it pc only or hybrid do not care much for standalone only if they were to make one also why would anyone enter smartphone market after first iphone maybe in a decade everyone will have their own vr set there were always competition in the console market and the business model is the same for all competitors what is doing facebook is acting like a console producer while the competition is acting like device producer i do not want closed ecosystems wars fb is already taking the lead with plenty of exclusivities and subsidized headsets so it will be harder for competitors to enter the market this has nothing to do with the iphones since it was expensive and apple did not rely on exlusivities we had a sane competition facebook is going the wrong way and the one applauding it are the dimwits short sighted exactly this i do not give a damn about my facebook info in exchange for a 200euros price cut only a 200euros price cut in australia your options for a vr headset are quest 2 or pay around dollar1000 usd the facebook issue is moot here there is no other option damn you aussies should make your own headsets because 1k just aint worth it honestly if they do for vr what they did for smartphones then i will happily pay 5 6x the price of an oculus quest for one why  i assure you most people who buy an oculus do it because of the price you can hate facebook and their terrifying way of stealing your information but at the end of the day their headset is sadly quite great in terms of price quality balance apple will datamine too and force you to login with your apple account and force you to play only with apple products and environments and will not be compatible with anything else it is the same shit but worse and for ten times the price  totally agree with the you are the product thing which explains the price of the oculus sadly though you can not really blame people who go for it because they simply could not afford a vr headset otherwise what i fail to see is why would not apple harvest your data too i am 100percent sure they already do every smartphone every alexa shit or siri thing does it they all do it when you buy a smartphone from any company apple included you are the product every time it really does not even matter what they do with the data they steal from you whether they sell it or keep it your data doesnt belong to you anymore and it might as well be public apple is not different from the others  i mean apple definitely datamines too  yeah people need to be more personal data aware not sure if that is a valid excuse to jack up the prices still   facebook does not have a cloud that is been hacked multiple times if someone gets my data from facebook they get a singe picture of my face from half a decade ago if someone gets my data from icloud they have hundreds of my nudes  in the same link you posted apple had 3 breaches and fb 5 not much better someone getting my facebook data also does not get anything from me because i do not use facebook i just have an account for vr someone gets my data from my apple account and i am fucked  but apple phones never get hacked gt icloud leaks of the weird shit that people do in apple vr i am not sure people will be able to do weird shit in apple vr anyway if apple can help to avoid a situation where occulus dominate everything i am all for it i just hope we will still have competitors outside of these two if you seriously compare a 300dollar product to a 3000dollar product you are flat out delusional i would be apple i would put the charging port 5mm next to the lens then make sure to exclude accidental scratching from the warranty cover should be already it anyway and then enjoy my dollarcash cowdollar you need to be an authorized repair technician to replace the lenses anyone else voids the warranty which you have to pay extra for also in order to become an authorized repair technician we are gonna need all of the personal information of every customer you have ever had in the past also you will need to buy our apple tools oh and pay the fee of course and the battery cannot be replaced so we are gonna go ahead and limit your processor speed so it does not burn it out oh look a full day has passed here is a new device only dollar1500 but look it is slightly better than your current one look a lot of that is very true but credit where its due apple phones recieve updates for 5 years which is a hell of a lot longer than any of their competitors this is barely english i am not native do i need to go to a trial do you really want to shame people for this are you 12 was that english enough for you sir there will be an external battery pack to be installed in your sinus cavity finally a use for our sinuses they have been sitting there unused when we could have been johnny mnemonicing our way through life this whole time you laugh now but i can bet they do that i could afford an index before an apple headset they probably would not even put a charging port on it yeah it will have wireless charging and you can only use bluetooth headphones would be annoying if you were a developer tho i think it would be annoying regardless as a developer i am gonna say every headset is annoying to work with but these which reinvented the wheel like oculus are the most annoying people complain about facebook oculus shit because they have not seen yet itunes vr yes  but they are awful in terms of owning your software media and devices  the walled garden model does not require them to actively sabotage repairs or make it impossible to transfer your music to another player that is just how they have chosen to implement it they could have all the pluses without those drawbacks but they choose this sure if you ignore the tens of thousands of leaked nudes i have despised that pos software for about 20 years now holy crap i think i will get the version that plugs straight into the instead my only complaint is that the vr playerbase is too small to have exclusives not naming names ahem and yet here is another contender who will potentially splinter it off into smaller fragments again they did invent the watch we know that for sure apple watch first of th name king of the andals and all the following shit i saw a joke like this before did apple make a vr headset or something coming later this year some ungody expensive standalone machine with a built in laptop grade processor and dual 8k lenses that they expect will only sell 1 per week per store apparently dang i get it was inevitable though reminds me of when they charged 600 i think for four little wheels i mean there is a bit of a difference between a set of wheels that are meant to fuck around and maybe make some cash from some dumbass influencers and a potentially really good product like the apple vr 3k for a standalone unit is probably a similar cost to what a valve index would cost between the headset and the gaming pc oh i see i thought it was just gonna be a slightly better samsung vr for 1k or something it is good to see apple making more quality products taking ideas that other people have had and recombining them into a better package is the essence of innovation apple haters are willfully ignorant of the fact that apple is simply better at creating compelling packages than other companies yes yes we know how much money you spent on your apple products and this is why apple is terrible and i will never willing but their products also is not that thing like a grand 3 grand it does not have a price  every headset iteration is examined and learned from by the competition a consumer facing 8k per eye eyetracking plus dynamic foveated standalone headset is a big deal because others can learn from it and make less expensive comparable products but its not consumer facing the leaks suggested this will be an enterprise product i am sorry but what the actual f if this is the final design apple gonna send the vr community back like nintendo did with the virtual boy dude this is a meme a meme of a render of a guess at the design even a meme of a possible prototype of a render of a guess at the design of the device even now that i am on my computer i see that it is a mouse and that there was a second picture tbh though i could see apple doing something stupid like that but regardless i am glad this is just a meme see it more as a dev kit like the hololens not a general public accessory for reference the hololens is dollar4950 it is rumoured to be more of an enterprise product not consumer level thing is apple really is not about the enterprise also if that headset was able to connect to and virtualize displays i would buy it in a heartbeat yeah there is a reason they are not about the enterprise enterprises refuse to pay their exorbitant prices for shit that does not work anyway  frankly it is dumb but not a disaster really you have the curve backwards but do you use it when you charge it it is going to be strictly standalone and probably wirelessly charge in its case but would it really matter i get that this is a meme but practically i do not see much wrong with it i use my quest while charging i will switch to sth sitting for a half hour then go back to standing or charge off a power pack a lot of people use the quest while charging also you could carry an external power brick this would be a really dumb design really doubt they would do it how else are you gonna get your superfans to buy multiple of the same product so they can keep using it by making the device itself very fragile and prevent the user from being able to fix it themselves haha imagine how ridiculous that would be oh wait lenses processor charging cable more expensive model that actually has a fucking charging port all sold separately you can not be serious you would not want to see the ports on your devices during operation would you perish the thought just get the head split surgery for only dollar120 000 duh i am getting a psvr2 as soon as that is announced lover of minigames or fabulous expensive designs may grab their quest 4 or ivr apple this is the way simple hack in through the anus out through the mouth nose head strap and charger sold separately you all have dongles right i would be ok with that i never charge my quest 2 whilst using it anyway no it is a terrible design the magic mouse was great but that design choice is baffling i have heard the reason they designed it that way was so that it would stop people from just keeping it plugged in all the time thus making the wireless feature pointless still inconvenient design though the but you are not using it like we intended excuse has always annoyed me with apple is bad design choices its not even like keeping it plugged in is a bad thing at all they still paid for a wireless mouse its their choice whether they want to use that feature or not i would say that is an excuse apple uses they thought being able to see a charging port would ruin the sleek appearance of the device it of course would make the best design sense to have said port on the front of the mouse but that would thicken the profile by a few millimeters so that clearly could never have been an option that might be pointless as the whole standalone business model is about the closed ecosystem maybe vive xr elite do not know what kind of library htc has but its also a giant megacorporation i bet all of them harvest data to be fair to htc they make a big deal about not selling your data it is one of the reasons they are so prevalent in the enterprise space i give them a lot of credit for sticking to that too it is a severe handicap when they are going up against the hugely subsidised kit from their competitors this is why i love to live in eu thinking your information has not been sold by everything you have used including reddit in 2023 is pretty fucking hilarious lol i do not think they can sell information from me that google has not already sold that might be true lol meta with pico as a distant second are the only standalone headsets with actual games available if you wanted a standalone headset for some sort of development or enterprise use pcvr or just watching media then you have vive xr elite or lynx r1 really your only option afaik at this point is htc is vive xr elite but as a standalone it is pretty lacking at the moment as the store is extremely bare vast majority of vr staples are not available a lot of people really do not like it but i have been pretty happy with mine so far since i mainly use it for pcvr i find it the most comfortable of all the proper headsets i own vive vive pro quest 2 but this does seem to vary wildly from person to person guess my head is just the right shape early reviews were really hard on this device but it seems to have come on a long way in the last few months htc has a vive discord set up and their devs pms seem pretty engaged with it and actively respond to feedback you can see the genesis of some of the new features in those discussions people shit on them as a company but while they have definitely made mis steps i do think they are trying to build a great product and having a player in this space that is not a front for data farming can only be a good thing full disclosure i got mine at an absolutely ridiculously low price around 1 3 of the rrp so it did not burn a huge hole in my pocket if i had paid full price and did not already own a q2 then i would have been way more disappointed by the standalone library for sure it is a gamble on that library expanding really if standalone is a key requirement because it just is not there yet so basically give information to china or give information to zuck amp x200b pick your poison that sucks those are the two worst options i have ever had in my life you are deaf to the sins of this world thinking aloud have people tried to jailbreak a quest so it sends no telemetry to meta but you still get to install apps from the quest store pimax crystal has standalone capabilities lenovo was working on a vr700 not sure if it is out yet or not vive also has a standalone model xr elite or something like that you could probably build your own with a youtube tutorial thinking that reddit doesnt do the same show me this mythical trustworthy company you speak of you are completely naive if you do not think all of these tech companies do the exact same thing including the company behind very site you posted this on i will admit that i have given in to the collective and joined the borg i figured my data is already everywhere so i will take advantage of the services that collect it and get the benefit they provide not going to give up google maps even though it is creepy when i search for a location and see you last visited three months ago think meta does not make money on our headset data a few years ago they offered a business version quest 2 for a few hundred dollars more than a standard version hardware was the same only difference was no meta account was needed to use it something like that but it was still a pay more to avoid data collection option yes they make money on games but part of the cost of the hardware is subsidized by data what kind of data does vr headset collect that is so different to other consoles size of your office the price is mostly subsidized by the game sales just like any other console on the market it is the exact same strategy as valve has with their steam deck that is why it can be cheaper than other devices the business headset not only did not require meta account it also comes with fast rma just like business version of other hardware does corporate laptops get replaced in a day servers and network devices in 4 hours it is probably 1 day for the business quest as well that is why your home router costs 200euros and the one sold to your workplace costs 10 as much sure costs about dollar20billion since you need to start the company yourself and build the software cheaper if you ask meta if you can use their hardware and just hire programmers to remove the software you do not want while we are on the topic do you not use a phone if you do then this is a moot point pimax crystal i have one and it is true it does have standalone but there is only like 10 apps right now so i would not recommend it if you are wanting it for standalone only the only real use of the standalone i have is watching movies and hopefully eventually having something like virtual desktop for wireless pcvr but right now that is not even on there vive xr elite is a only option but it not how data collections and usage works no one steal you data because you do not lose anything at all you share but what you share and how depend on a lot of factors like meta acc is probably best privacy focus acc from all mega corps because meta is gatekeeper company so eu raped it ass so much meta acc is amazing for privacy bitedance is not not only this you need to see this vid it good information on how your data is used but tldr no one give a shit about you personal data you are one of many data point used to target ads amp x200b btw meta do sell headset for cheap not because of data from fb meta make about 20 eu i a year from one person it in hope you buy games and this does make a lot of money because two games on average price make way more money than one year of data collection not only this all meta quest users is free beta testers because meta rolls update every 4 8 weeks to add new features and similar stuff so curent vr users is more or less free testers htc focus but i do not recommend it htc vive focus 3 is a standalone 5k resolution and 120 fov it is standalone but i do not know what kind of apps are available for it i do not know if it can work wirelessly with a pc either everyone gonna complain about fov and the measurement process while i am kind of just lamenting the lack of progress in the controller space given that knuckles are still recommended all the new competitors seem to be gimmicky with major trade offs like no analog stick an open version of the quest pro controllers would be awesome but that would take a miracle as someone in a wheelchair having the knuckles strap onto my hand was such a huge improvement for me i will be pretty disappointed if my next setup has to forgo that you can buy hand straps for pretty much every type of controller out there now htc have been making quest style headset tracked controllers for their headsets for years now i do not understand why they do not just release a lighthouse version of those norm is got a hands on a lot of stuff makes sense after watching that it is got quest pro price tag but it is hyper personalized like literally the facial interface is custom made per person from a face scan the ipd is built in to the goggles for the specific person and it includes lenses for your own eyeglass prescription this this is the ultimate light small 5k oled vr headset trying to be comfortable and customized for long use for people already heavily invested in the vr industry it is like an f1 team building the car is seat for the specific driver except for a vr headset it is not trying to be your first vr headset or the headset you show other people vr for the first time with in context this price point feels appropriate imo if i was still doing a lot of simracing and simflying in vr i would be all over this thing sadly i do not have the time for anything except a casual hour here and there in vr these days so the hotas wheel pedals stand etc are collecting dust yeah that was a good video and very impressed by darshan and how forthcoming he was about their objectives and what the headset could and could not do down to earth guy who was not trying to oversell anything still a little too rich for me approaching nearly dollar2k if you need to get the base stations and controllers but i really like a lot of the concepts here this video proves to me that weight is one of the most neglected aspects of headsets today and i am dying to try something like this in the 150g range that is awesome and i really appreciate that they chose to focus on this aspect for their product i am curious how good it would be for office work that is what i am waiting on in the vr ar space i want to lay in bed comfortably and be productive with 16 desktops open while petting my dog i have been waiting for something useful to work in vr and it looks like this could be it my hammock and datahands have also been waiting i settled down more was not angry just baffled after watching the norm video and thrillseeker even did an balanced impression of it intellectually i understand everything the ceo is going for and all the points he makes does sound good thrillseeker said this is perfect for him because yes he is on pcvr all the time and there is so much bulk on his index he no longer needs why is it still bulky like a standalone in 2023 pcvr at this time should be lighter since it is not doing on board computing or using a battery like a quest 2 and this is where the bigscreen beyond comes in for pcvr enthusiasts however at the same time i can not shake off the hurdles the price and base stations and controllers and no passthrough not to mention glasses users are required to spend another dollar80 on prescription insets if money was not an object this does seem like a great headset to have but everyone is goal is to make money and grow a company will this headset do that seems really hard at this point especially in this economic climate yes i do think it is going to be tough to sell enough of these i think the market they are targeting is like 3 niches down within vr if this thing is treated like a prototype and they only plan to sell a few thousand they might be fine maybe they see it as a stepping stone to a wider market vr product if they think this thing is going to explode and sell even 10percent of quest sales they are delusional but i get the feeling they are being realistic about it gt it is not trying to be your first vr headset or the headset you show other people vr for the first time with gt gt gt gt in context this price point feels appropriate imo its also not the vr headset you can resell easily so shelling out 1k for a thing that you know you are going to keep and wont be able to resell should you want or need to is definetly aimed at a certain limited public i mean that is me i have not sold any of my vr headsets even the ones i never want to touch again by the time i get to that point they are worth like dollar80 this is me as well i only have a reverb g2 and cardboard but i do not think i would ever sell them at least not for a long time or whatever headsets i end up with in the future it is the same reason why i have never gotten rid of any of my nintendo devices for example there is the nostalgia factor but sometimes it is just cool to revisit old hardware to see how things have progressed they become both technological and personal artifacts strangely or perhaps not i really do not care about keeping my old iphones which i would guess is probably due to the fact that i update them more frequently and that they remain largely unchanged from one iteration to the next long story short i do not usually consider the near term resale potential of a device when purchasing it and i would guess many others do not either and in thrillseeker is video he says that the custom components can be removed so that you can resell it and the buyer can then purchase those custom parts from the company afterwards so you are really only eating the cost of the custom parts that is the one i was waiting for tyvm for sharing lot is of hate in this thread obviously not for everyone but if your primary use is consuming content like movies etc or even productivity related tasks this could be really sick it also pushes competitors to make sharper and lighter headsets this is their gen 1 after all and people are freaking out yea there seem to be a lot of people that can not see past their own preferences i know perfectly well that devices that are not for me are not automatically failures i do not get why that is a hard thing to understand its like avacados or pineapple on pizza some people struggle seeing past their own preferences and they pass judgment on everything as if their standards are thee standard lol eugh i know what you mean i remember some guy on here who was complaining about still using an htc vive saying he wanted a next generation vr headset and lots of people were explaining to him how the contemporary lineup of recent release and upcoming releases were next generation and it turns out dudebro just had extremely arbitrary definition of what constitutes next generation gt i know perfectly well that devices that are not for me are not automatically failures because it is not a big enough market to be a niche inside a niche i think there is this underlying and i would say fallacious assumption that the vr industry is a zero sum game i e the effort that went into this headset could have been put into a different kind of headset on this subreddit this theoretical headset seems to be a high fov oled pancake uncompressed dp pcvr that is not too bulky and under dollar1k vr is still burgeoning but seems to now be at this awkward stage where more and more headsets are being released but each new headset is still big news to the community attracting close often passionate scrutiny i am glad we have these vocal critics but it is also an inevitability and actually a good sign of growth that headsets are diversifying to fill a variety of needs and niches with a few exceptions we generally do not care about each new laptop or phone that comes out we just research it when it comes time to get a new one it might be a slow climb but eventually vr hardware will reach that point gt lot is of hate in this thread welcome to r virtualreality everything is hated instantly unless it come from valve lol are you kidding people spend half of their day here trying to shit on the index as being outdated caveman tech i shit on it because it is never been made available here in australia as do i death to the index send the roos out you do know it is often available via ebgames right though i reshipped mine via a friend in the us way before it was at eb if i made a quest 2 or index thread guess which one gets downvotes faster not saying index does not get shit on from time to time but it is the favored son over here and meta quest 2 are deemed the inbred toothless invaders according to some angry posts gonna go out on a limb looks cool might buy ppl who are dishing on this thing why this is everything i am looking for in a headset fov small but it uses pancake lenses so you will get better mileage out of the actual usable viewable sweet spot ppd yes please microoled panels yes weight so much yes lighthouse tracking fuck yea displayport you win form factor there is nothing close to this right now a pcvr headset thank you this headset does everything i want it scrapped all the nonsensical crap that is not ready for showtime yet and gave us a good display with display port this is what i have been waiting for in pcvr personally it is why i was hyped in the sameway for the meganex shiftall but that one does not look like it got a good reception due to issues with the optics is it expensive relatively yes but this is a smaller company and i will take that startup tax is it inflexible yes this is a con you will not be able to share this headset for me though i am kind of past the party trick phase of vr and i mean kudos to you if you are entertaining a lot and vr is a thing that occurs not downplaying that aspect of the hobby for me personally i am the one using the vr headset almost always so this is not as big of an issue for me this is the one the only thing i could see supplanting this is apple coming out and saying they will support steamvr exactly all this thank you for communicating it so well i want to acknowledge that this is not for everybody but we intentionally wanted to focus on weight comfort resolution oled etc we wanted to push the bounds of immersion and comfort 127 grams vs 700 800 grams 28 ppd vs 10 20 ppd for some people this will be the right tradeoff for them also our displays and optics alone cost more than a quest costs haha it is pricey next generation materials that are just coming to market and are not yet able to be manufactured at the scale of millions of units micro oled has not come down the cost curve yet thanks are you from the bigscreen team o love what you are doing with this my one please can i have this is have you reached out to nofio for wireless support that appears to be darshan shankar ceo of bigscreen i gotta say one aspect i love of the weird internet future we live in is that we will randomly be talking to someone on a thread like these and it turns out they are actually some bigwig since it uses micro oled displays how bright is the device can it use hdr and they have a 3 000 nits rating but i would not get too hyped about that number as norm also said the headset does not feel very bright so it is likely due to the pancake lens you are only getting a small fraction of it is dynamic range throw in a couple free 3d movie rentals and you got yourself a deal i am super interested in this headset do you know if it will support 3 dof tracking with an xbox controller and no lighthouse base stations also is the cable proprietary or will you be able to replace it with a shorter or longer aftermarket cable i do not have much experience with steamvr tracking so i will have to look into that a bit more but so far it looks like bigscreen beyond addresses all of the major issues i had with the quest pro with the only real tradeoff for me being potentially worse controllers and a lack of color passthrough although i never use passthrough on my reverb g2 and mostly use an xbox controller so neither of those are deal breakers especially if standalone 3 dof is working i am really looking forward to seeing some reviews though hopefully it is as great in person as it looks on paper watch this for about 1 minute gt do you know if it will support 3 dof tracking with an xbox controller and no lighthouse base stations i would also like to know the answer to this question watch this for about 1 minute i would also like to know if 3dof without lighthouse tracking might work yeah this really does hit a lot of my win points too one of the issues i have with it is the fully custom face cushion being a requirement and needing an iphone to get the 3d mapping done i have no clue how complicated it would be to have generic cushions for a headset this size but i think having an option for it would be nice but i get the sell it is your headset another is definitely price for me and my shit eyes i would need to get the custom lens inserts very cool with the magnetic mounting but i fear how much these will cost me vroptician set me back 300usd for my index still very interested in this headset dollar79 see if the range of opthalmic options will suit that is pretty cheap and flat rate too not too shabby honestly i am also happy with this i have been stuck with an og vive pro forever because i can not stand led black levels add in a mic that people will not bitch about in world and that is all i really want i have got all the gear i do not want my next headset to waste precious budget on peripherals and tracking that i already have what would be really cool is if version 2 skimps even more and i could hold on to my lenses custom face mask but why are you excited about displayport what am i missing i am in the same boat still clinging to my vive pro for those inky blacks and wireless a little disappointed by the fov but i kept saying if another pcvr headset came out with oled that i would put my money where my mouth is i have come to expect that from this subreddit everyone want is something different so no matter what comes out there are people who complain and due to human nature it seems complaints get the most upvotes i guess i will have to go borrow my brothers iphone to do the scan thing this looks absolutely insane for the kind of sim driving flying i like to do in vr the weight alone makes it worth the price to me oled resolution etc is great too i realize that the fov is a dealbreaker for most in this subreddit but it is overall a very exciting product and the v2 will likely have a better fov this is just their first go at it and a very impressive result at that it clearly is a high end proof of concept anyway this is not trying to match pimax or psvr2 in terms of fov it is trying to be ultra compact and it looks like it achieved that this is the kind of device size i would be happy with in the future it is pretty much a perfect device size so many people i know do not play vr anymore just because it is generally uncomfortable and the games game play are not that good if we could make future hmds at this size without the sacrifice in other areas i think this has a chance to change a lot for vr yeah people need to realize that with commercially available early 2020s technology it is a pretty direct inverse relationship between form factor and fov i think it is very impressive for what it is in an interview they said light small high res and oled where their targets they knew they could not achieve them without accepting what they describe as quest fov to be fair clearly the vast majority of the market is ok with quest is fov so i understand why they did that to achieve 5k oled in a package the size of swimming goggles are they committed to a v2 even if this thing completely flops as is likely well this company at least has relatively successful software to stay afloat there probably wont be a v2 unless this is successful the form factor is cool the size weight alone seems like it would be extremely comfortable given the custom faceplate but the ios requirement for the scan is an odd limiting factor fov is around quest 2 levels so definitely a trade off to allow for the pancake high res displays my largest issue is the 1k cost for just the headset that is a bit much given that you still need lighthouse trackers and knuckles controllers just to use the thing and that tacked on makes an expensive product even more so 2x the cost of an index headset for smaller higher res seems like a lot when lowering fov worse audio cheaper headstrap etc granted you are really paying for the mirco oled here and for some that may be worth an upgrade just depends on the type of user you are it is still interesting always glad to see new competition in this space ios has always been ahead for photogrammetry related tasks because of their depth sensors the cost appears to be a result of those oled displays that he thinks he found the display they are using and to buy one it costs dollar500 so it does seem likely the bulk of the cost of this headset is the displays plus not eye tracking more info on it deal breaker imho not fixed ipd it is fixed to exactly your ipd it is custom made for your face great so when my friends want to try it i order another headset cas specifically says both cas and chary got to try it out and when cas tried out chary is headset it was extremely uncomfortable though her own special headset was great so yes it seems like it is something you will not be able to share with friends and family in fairness if you shelling out that level of cash for this type of product i do not foresee many people openly sharing it it is different when it is a quest or hp reverb but when a company specifically claims it is custom designed for you you are not buying it with sharing in mind no surprise they have pretty different facial geometry the face gasket was uncomfortable not the headset itself jesus fucking christ dude people is comprehension these days is so fucking bad it is not for that use case this is supposed to be the best possible or experience for you if you want to share it then this is not the headset for you that said anyone who is a millimetre or two in either direction will be fine since the sweet spot is much bigger when your friends want to try it they order another headset honestly the stupid iphone requirement is the real deal breaker do not you guys have iphones into the trash it goes oh that sucks agreed the iphone is the only device that can do sub millimeter scans that produce an accurate face scan also the process is not a custom app it will be a qr code so store display models can do the scan just fine gt it will be a qr code so store display models can do the scan just fine that is a great point which was not clear to me i have no phone and no apple product in the venn diagram of devices i do not own an iphone is probably in the middle meh and here i thought my revopoint 3d scanner could do it are you happy with the revopint 3d scanner i saw the kickstarter a while ago but didnt go for it been wondering what the final result was double deal breaker gbp1 149 00 oh man that fov this sub is cancer instead of killing the baby before it lands in the cradle we should be celebrating the little advancements if we ever want this industry to progress 90hz 2560px oled practically glasses form factor the face scan with iphone is a major bummer considering the majority of the world uses android but can we at least wait until people get their hands on it before we strike down one more entry into the cast this sub has been oddly disinterested in new hmds compared to others i remember there being big excitement for any news about new hmds on the vive subreddit while this is not for me it has like you say got some clear advantages to most other products on the market and i hope they will do well enough to make future products it is the fact these vr subs skew incredibly young and they know their parents will not buy them a headset that cost more than dollar300 so they hate it to not feel bad about their quest 2 i think the quest 2 part of your comment is particularly relevant unfortunately the q2 has set a bar for many people one that even meta cannot now beat the q2 brought in many new potential vr enthusiasts but ones who expect vr to just get better in all ways and cheaper from there but it was far underpriced for the tech i would upgrade my index to this instantly that weight and formfactor is very interesting yea folks that already have the base stations and controllers are their best chance of reaching enough people to pay the bills holy that looks incredibly promising although i can see multiple things that make me question how well it will perform on the market it seems to have no ipd adjustment but rather the ipd gets custom built for you meaning it will be hard to sell on the 2nd hand market it also has no inside out tracking capabilities limiting it is market to people who already have base stations and controllers it is fov is mediocre at 90 degrees starting at 1400 euros i personally think this is a hard sell but we will have to wait and see for reviewers to test it definitely a hard sell the custom built specs are nice but now i think its what would tack on extra cost and make it hard to resell as you mentioned unless the 3d printing community or 3rd party market steps in for this lack they tout 6x lighter than other headsets on the market it would have been impressive if they even cut that weight by half or more and add in adjustable ipd and better fov lightweight is great but it looks like they left out some other features i do not want big fov but come one give us at least pico 4 or quest pro fov i have no comparison been on the quest 1 apparently with 90 fov and i am still impressed in general i bought it for dollar400 with controllers brand new and felt it was game changing i am loving this new push for better functionality lighter weight and sleek form factors but i will always be sold with the original release of headset controllers and a price not breaking 1k usd the quest 1 has more than 90 it is actually much better than the quest 2 i am telling you the fact that this barely reaches q2 fov is a big fail the fov is 93 degrees and ymmv for some it will be closer to 95 degrees hfov which is 1 degree shy of the quest 2 for resale other people with a similar ipd will be able to use the headset easily if they wish they can also order a custom foam cushion from us to use with their second hand headset it is designed to be the optimal fit for you and your ipd never changes so we opted to significan notly reduce the weight thanks for clarifying but is there at least a manual way of changing ipd even if we have to grab a screwdriver congrats on this and your success with bigscreen as a whole it is a wise move to attack the form factor head on it is most certainly one of the largest impediments to adoption one that veterans and enthusiasts underestimate does your device accommodate optical asymmetry i e vertical and lateral offset per eye mediocre is generous 90 degrees fov more like lack of view it is pretty clear that the majority of vr users value a larger fov 120 130 degree would be the sweet spot but very few are hitting even that but at the same time it is hard to deny in a saturated vr headset market that there is not a niche room for light weight high fidelity headset like this thing is showing to be i am personally very curious it would be quite good as a secondary headset and at 1k for the hmd it might actually be a semi viable ish buy for a vr enthusaist assuming you already have the other parts it is the sort of thing where you would want to use it for a few hours to evaluate the value that the form factor brings to the table because it really is a next gen form factor the sort of device where the friction for long term comfort is significan notly reduced and i can see people starting to use for prolonged periods to do their daily computing in fail of view more resolution fov and resolution is always a trade off but for using a vr monitor with pancake lenses i bet it is a good one flop of view the fov is 93 degrees and ymmv for some it will be closer to 95 degrees hfov which is 1 degree shy of the quest 2 you will be hard pressed to notice an fov difference to the quest 2 in practice thank you but no dollar1400 in europe for a headset that does not come with controllers and base stations and has a fov of 90 yeah bye 1000 dollars maybe with everyhing controllers and base stations also anything less than pico 4 quest pro fov is an absolute no for me the headset is not for you but so many of these responses are so shortsighted this type of headset in terms of size and weight and resolution is exactly what vr needs now if we could increase the fov in future iterations and the lower the price i see it as a game changer this is an exciting headset and i might buy it and sacrifice the fov just to finally have potentially a really comfortable lightweight hmd with good visuals let is see reviews first tho  i am sure custom faceplate and optics might feel great and i know they are not meta but i feel weird sending any tech company a scan of my face we will see if reviewers rave about the comfort when it actually releases but its interesting it is a neat idea but the price point makes it such a lackluster option if you are willing to spend so much on vr you are probably willing to deal with a big and heavy headset because you want the vr no matter what nobody who was not sold on vr already will buy a headset at its price just because it is lighter and less bulky it is not about selling people on vr but keeping them in it how many of us are enthusiastic for vr and excited for it is future but hate the way we feel when we have worn the hmd for a couple of hours i am not necessarily hyped for this hmd because i do not have any experience with the company is hardware but i am hyped about the form factor of vr headsets finally changing i think the comfort is the ultimate feature i can spend in vr maybe an hour or two before my head hurts the fact that is custom made for the user is awesome and justifies the price but no passthrough is unfortunately a deal breaker for me is your goal to have ar features that is something i still want to see improve in headsets but when the headset is so easy to lift off your eyes and will fit perfectly back onto your face this seems better than ever for hopping in and out of vr looks amazing and is finally pcvr as small as possible quest pro compared to an index is so thin so seeing a company push how small an hmd can be is amazing pcvr does not have a lot of new games that im excited for and i can not justify upgrading if i only play vrchat i am in sold already have vive hardware and index controllers vive is on its way out the door i have been waiting for a new oled headset and it looks like this is it my primary uses are beat saber and elite dangerous deep blacks are my number one priority this looks sick i am curious about how it feels for beat saber all their demo cases seem to focus on sitting non active experiences here is why i am optimistic about this although this is not a value headset it is still half the cost of the varjo aero there is now an option with proper oled and pancake lenses i did not even know oled pancake was possible because pancake lenses are so inefficient with light so you really have to crank the brightness i thought we were gonna have to wait for mini led to move away from lcd on pancake also consider that you can get this plus two base stations and index controllers for a similar cost as quest pro that is a serious improvement compared to something like aero i expect this to be the new clarity king based on the specs i personally care way way more about ppd than fov that is why g2 is my favorite headset and it is not even close i have not bought aero because dollar2 700 all in is just too much for me reducing the cost by a grand is quite intriguing if nothing else yeah it is not cheap and not for everyone but the same can be said about a number of competing headsets for some people and use cases it should be great i also really like how they customize it just for you as well honestly that has to be a logistics nightmare but it makes total sense to me they could just sell a gasket to someone else in the future if you sell it most people fall within a slim ipd range anyway idk the offering makes sense to me and i am really tempted by it i hate how long it is away pretty sick product if your intent is to use it for more entertainment than gaming i can see bigscreen making a good push for this if customers want to enjoy watching imax movies and the lines using their product the resolution is miles better than anything else out in that price range the possible media consumption audience is huge but unfortunately the part of that audience willing to invest that much cash plus the hassle of steamvr tracking seems like it will be tiny for now tech will get better and less cumbersome it has to start somewhere the way i see it is that bigscreen was just an vr theater app that is now also dropping vr tech if they can make sizable investments like this imagine what other startups can also produce i wholly welcome competition it is only the end consumers that benefit i can not wait for the future of media consumption via vr this headset ticks every box for productivity workers too the limitations for that use case always been ppd and comfort not fov dollar2000 including controllers and base stations for a 90 degree fov headset no thanks edit and an extra dollar99 for the audio solution edit i just checked using a vpn and in germany the valve knuckes are 300eur and 2x base stations are 320eur that is 620eur the headset price from the bigscreen website shipped to germany free shipping btw is 1370 eur which is a huge 45percent increase over the dollar999 price in the usa so altogether it is 1370eur 620eur 1990eur dollar2132 all in with headset knuckles and base stations that is without the audio strap so yeah the european price of this headset package is a legitimate joke for what you get here where are you getting dollar2000 from should not it be dollar1500 if you do not have base stations yeah and it is not even 120hz also i need to buy now an iphone too if i want to buy it what does it need an iphone for just for the facial interface ipd map thing or to actually operate it once you have it some of you wanted a pcvr headset you got it i agree with thrill is opinion of it in that what makes this headset great is that it takes advantage of pcvr is offboarding of computation to aggressively push the form factor all the way down to just the tracking and the core optics and displays in that sense this is like a pure specimen of a pcvr headset looks good i am absolutely dying to throw my money at a next gen pcvr headset the real deal breaker for me with this headset is the field of view the headset is about quest 2 is fov we do fall behind some other headsets in terms of fov but to innovate on other parts of the headset like form factor comfort resolution amp oled displays that is a trade off we have had to make as for reselling ipd is the trickiest part in any case we will offer separate custom cushions as well which should help this headset sure has a lot going for it coming from the g2 i am personally looking for a wider fov even if that means compromising on comfort and form factor i hope this is a success though this looks great for watching movies i am glad there is more competition well this came out of nowhere personally i can certainly deal with the 90 degree fov given all of the other craziness that the headset offers but you can only buy it if you have an iphone what what a strange decision i do not mind that fov or fixed ipd but i do wish it were wireless seems to defeat the purpose of ultralight if you are gonna be tethered v2 should be fantastic honestly i feel like i would make the fov vs clarity trade off any day it is like wearing small glasses you trade your fov for clarity yeah i like many others have an issue with the fov which made me completely shrug it off on impulse so it will not be a replacement for the quest pro or whatever high end headset you own for gaming use however i think this will be a great unit for several reasons the lens technology will offer an excellent picture for the fov you do have and pancake lenses will offset the low fov due to additional clarity across the whole viewing range this means i think the unit will be a great movie watching headset which i still have yet to find small form factor means very light weight and portable i use a quest pro now and it is even less portable feeling than the quest 2 was this should appeal to a larger audience on that alone absolutely a nice offering this is another competitor in the space we need this to push the technology forward and continue innovation they are releasing a small form factor headset and it is pcvr pcvr is on life support and this is going to keep interest going it is quite expensive but that is what you get for being an early adopter of any technology i believe the micro oled tech is the most expensive part of the unit and is why it is so expensive but 2 3 years down the pipe they will be better developed we need to support companies like this because they keep our dreams of great vr alive look at it this way if this is their first foray into vr headsets and they create a successful small form factor unit we will have renewed interest in pcvr which could mean more games more people playing vr on pc and ultimately more competition means better technology they could even focus on creating a valve index competitor in the future all in all bravo and i hope this lands i also think the on paper specs can only tell you so much it is possible that in practice the greater clarity as you said along with being able to move your head around effortlessly could sufficiently offset the unimpressive fov plus like all headsets there are many other intangible factors that can only be taken into account after using it for at least a few weeks especially for a headset this unique and this does not have to sell millions it just has to be successful enough to allow them to fund the development of v2 which could be that unicorn hmd that most folks want here i look forward to when non reviewers get their hands on these and start sharing their thoughts my wife would buy this over a quest 2 in a heartbeat because of the design not everything is for the hardcore gamer even though it can handle it so some thoughts the size and weight is a big fucking plus while a lot of us who are already in the vr space do not mind current vr hmd sizes and weights for mainstream adoption to occur we need devices in this size weight specification vr hmds like the g2 are already really light and comfortable but its bulky size is still a turn off for a lot of people that try it the fact that out of the box it is directly compatible for steamvr basestations is a huge plus if you are already in that ecosystem i do think that even with the push for better camera style tracking in windows mixed reality type vr hmds the steamvr basestation tracking provides a much more accurate and better overall vr experience if you already have the basestations and controllers and the tracking pucks if you want full body tracking in social stuff like vrchat this seems like a huge win i use a valve index for all movement based vr experiences and a g2 in my simrig the cost to performance for this product is really horrid i am someone that thinks current fov in most vr hmds anywhere between 100 and 115 degrees of fov is a good amount i do not think it needs to be much larger as we have seen vr hmds that go larger have fish eying effects on the periphery of the view however 90 degrees of fov at a cost of dollar1000 and that is just the hmd no integrated audio solution or tracking tech is a huge fucking ask imo also the frame rate does not seem to exceed 90hz which given how much people love the index for going up to 144hz i use mine at 120hz this could also be a huge downgrade you need an iphone to buy the thing looks like you need it to scan your face before purchasing that is a huge wtf there are an absolute fuck ton of people who use android phones what you gotta find a friend with an iphone what if you are in a situation where you know literally no one that has an iphone why force people to even use an iphone this seems like an extremely limiting step for an already niche product i wanna really like it because i do think the overall physical footprint of vr hmds need to shrink down to something like this formfactor but at that cost bigscreen is my favorite app fingers crossed that the split priorities between software and hardware does not make them lose the ability to work on making the app better questions i need answered about the headset battery life cost controllers standalone or wired why gt cost pre order is gbp1 149 it is steam lighthouse tracked so you can use any controllers that will work with that it is pcvr only with a dedicated displayport connection the headset is only wired so you do not need to worry about the battery life the preorder cost is dollar1 000 usd for the headset and flexible strap base stations and controllers will need to be bought separately they have an audio strap that you can buy or use your own headphones to hear there are no built in speakers but the mic is great the most important thing to know about the headset is that it is pcvr only it is not stand alone all the power comes from your computer bradley just dropped a video covering it too  inside out tracking is not a plus unless it comes from facebook where they got it working reasonably well most of us want accurate tracking pico tracking is also good enough no you need to add the additional base stations people who have base stations and have had them since the vive need to do nothing my thoughts and values must represent everyone no one uses valve base station tracking because i do not use it the 20percent of vr users on steam with valve base stations i was very exited at first micro oled very small form factor steamvr tracking perfectly adjusted ipd this was the perfect headset then come the bad news quest 2 fov disapointing but i can go over it high res without eye tracking very disapointing too but it didnt kill the headset yet but i am euro citizen between the extremly high price and the requirement for a super rare phone no i do not know anyone using an iphone even in extended circles that thing is doa for me good news is that bigscrfeen should have plenty of time custom crafting the face masks people come here surprised that there are many people who claim that they do not know anyone who has an iphone well to their surprise outside of north america not many people have iphones i am from europe and i do not know anyone with an iphone there are only 2 persons that i ever knew that had an iphone a cousin a few years ago because the company where he worked gave him one and a childhood friend that i met again 5 6 years ago right now i do not know anyone with an iphone this is incredibly confusing to me even in the poor eastern european countries there is still 10 to 20percent iphone ownership do you not know 5 to 10 people they are only releasing in the us to start european release is later maybe to give them time to do an android version of their scanning app they also need to fix the pricing before trying something for the euro market right now it doesnt make sense gt no i do not know anyone using an iphone even in extended circles that amazes me people i know are split about 50 50 iphone android i just have one very important question will it support prescription lens inserts im sure someone out there will be able to 3d print a lens holder that fits over the vr headset lenses but this is always important because i refuse to wear glasses with any vr headset yup it is mentioned at the end of the landing page they provide custom lenses up to 10 00 with astigmatism support if this had higher fov wireless and eye tracking i would pre order but dollar1500 cad for this is is a no from me right now my index is still working fine i will use that until the next big thing i hate this thing i want a dollar300 vr headset that is wireless 150 degree fov with eye tracking but still has everything this headset has vr dreamer this is truly innovative i hope they can pull it off wish they would do an inside out tracked version though idk i feel like that is what killed the g2 i am kinda down with just steam vr support i just wish one could get 2 basestations and index controllers for like dollar299 instead of twice that that thing looks cool but the price is incredibly steep and i do not see the outstanding features that justify it yeah it is small and light and it has a high resolution but is the fov better than current headsets why is there no included audio at that price plus high resolution means beefy system my measly 1070ti will not cut it and i do not have the money for a bigger card at the current prices in conclusion this headset is not for me and i am not even sad about it i would rather have wireless than lighter anyway but even that not at that pricepoint  i am pretty sure these same people would also call the shitfall too expensive 1k for the headset 100 for the audio strap 580 for base stations and controllers the price is adding up fast limited fov fixed ipd no wireless which is a feature a lot of people want in these small form factors for being on the go it seems like a niche product in a niche market i get sacrifices need to be made for this small form factor but i am not willing to make those at this price i think headsets like these will be more common in the next couple of years for a much lower prices it seems like an expensive movie watcher rather than a daily driver i do wish bigscreen success if you want wireless while keeping it on the same size weight as it currently is aka swimming goggles size factor then you are asking for a non existing technology or you have military sized budget batteries do be heavy but yeah this is a niche device hyperfocusing on one aspect of vr and making sacrifices on the rest there is a small market for it in this already niche hobby we see with the nofio that it is possible without too much additional bulk so no it is not impossible even if they had an attachment for wireless that would probs be enough for me i would pay extra for it no option for wireless and no eye tracking addon is a killer for me on one hand this is a godsend for people who mainly care about watching reading or even working in vr like me 90 fov is enough for enjoying 3d imax like experiences at home hell if you can use your phone as a remote like with the nreal then you might do not even need to invest in a lighthouse system yet on the other hand the lack of ability to use it as a standalone headset might kill it because i certainly would not want to enjoy movies while sitting by my computer i want to lie down comfortably or use it on the go like on an airplane that is where it is form factor really shines if only it has wifi and supports vd the fov of bigscreen headset is not big lol what is with all the hate it is a nice breath of fresh air for pcvr headsets the standalone is are great but there is just no love for pcvr focus only there are massive issues here with this hmd fixed ipd you can not buy a fully functioning hmd directly from this company you have to buy a large part of the kit from valve this is insanity do you understand how hard it has been to buy base stations from valve over the last few years valve is going to transfer manufacturing for base stations to htc in the near future not really the most scientific test but i just checked steam and base stations are in stock we understand your concern about the fixed ipd but please note the ipd will be fixed to your ipd this makes it harder to share but does mean it is perfect for you specifically availability of the base stations on steam has actually been quite good the past 6 12 months awesome to see a dev in the thread i am extremely excited for this headset how many total preorders will you be accepting i want to preorder this in 2 3 months do you estimate you would still have spots available on the preorder list base stations have been in stock for many months now people need to chill about fov if you do not like it just buy something else i am sure it may work for some given the small form factor that is the tradeoff not everyone is willing to have an hmd the size of a shoe box like the 8kx or even the crystal you bring up a very strange concept buy what you need and works for you it is a bit radical but i think i get what you mean lol that said i do not like the fov however i almost do not care because of the virtues of the small light headset i do not need one of these and i put extreme importance on fov and refresh rate but i may still buy one of these just for watching movies and stuff like that i already do that and have since i started heavy into vr back in 2016 but this is fascinating i would almost buy it purely so it has a chance to live and develop it is crazy how small headsets have been getting and the fov fov isnt great but it is not the only thing that matters in a headset or do you only use your pimax 5k and nothing else interesting but not a complete winner for me micro oled and displayport yes custom fit yes weight awesome fov meh although the pico showed me that size of sweet spot makes smaller fov feel less constricting but 90 is just too low if it had pico sized fov it would be more appealing the tested review mentioned glare which sounds like the pico pancake lens glare and can be annoying steamvr tracking is cool but i would have liked some inside out for ease of use i see the use case for this but not for the price yea it is aimed at a very specific audience i think it could do well if they understand that small but loyal market well quite an interesting headset for enthusiasts which would be a no brainer for me if not for the fov and the high price tag i somehow feel like the vr hardware producing companies do not really get what the vr market needs besides more better games imho more hmds at an affordable price for casual gamers right now we only got the quest 2 and the upcoming 3 the pico and we might include the psvr2 in case one already owns a ps5 for any other hmd the price is too high for casuals to step into the vr world if we had more variance in the lower price segment and as said above more interesting games within the aa aaa league probably more people would give it a try do we need another niche going headset to grow the market i do not think so at least not at this point maybe later when more gamers are bound to the vr ecosystem so why do companies through so many enthusiast hardware on the market instead of starting it slowly but steady i own the rift s the index the pico and will for sure buy the next best allrounder headset for pcvr hoping for the index 2 but by far not everyone is willing to put so much money in vr just my 2 cents lack of wireless shame collab with nofio could have been cool 90 fov is unacceptable at this price point this looks fucking rad ppd clarity and comfort are my top priorities and this looks like it will nail them all fingers crossed for success you have my attention i have to honestly say i am glad i have not bought an xr elite yet because this looks like a viable competitor in my book against it i am going to wait for the real world reviews and see what the real world fov is then if nofio is able to make this wireless as well damn this might be the last headset i buy for a very long time we will see this has certainly piqued my interest i am currently using a g2 so i need to buy base stations and controllers but for the form factor resolution and extreme lightweight the dollar1500 price does not seem that bad for pc focused enthusiast hardware i never share around my headset but i can not say the generic adjustable optics and face cushion have ever bothered me before though i guess making them bespoke like that makes the headsets simpler to manufacture fewer moving parts and in a way cheaper i do not think i will be in the first batch of orders but if the final reviews are good i can see this being my next headset regardless more pcvr headsets and more steamvr headsets is always good news even if you are not nessisarly the target demographic why on earth did they not include a generic facial interface as well as the custom it is such a weird hmd can it be used on the couch to watch movies with 3dof literally the entire point of the company um i do not know if it can or not what now how can that not be a definite feature 90 degree fov no thank you too bad the rest sounds pretty awesome but im done with looking through a scuba mask new vr must be 140 horisontal fov or it is a no go seem like pimax is the only option so far and i hate their hammerhead form this definitely has some appeal seeing the pictures of it next to a quest 2 is like oh crap i did not realize how big a quest 2 is i am trying to get into vr dev a much smaller pcvr headset is appealing to me for that vs putting giant headsets on and off and just in general it looks like it beats the picture of a lot of headsets the custom fit is appealing the size is appealing seems pretty overpriced for what you get or do not get actually 90 degree field of view and no inside out tracking and dollar1000 doa this is like something from a random booth at ces for some niche device they are releasing only in china except it is not 1000dollar headset with no face eye tracking no controllers or lighthouses 90 degree fov no on board audio and requiring a specially made face gasket that you need to send a random company a faceid scan of your face for if you even have an iphone in the first place i am sure there are a few people out there that will fit the criteria for this headset but that is an insane ask for someone who does not already have an index to scavenge the tracking from kudos for the advancement of technology in this small of a form factor decent features but will be dead in the water for me at least do not have an iphone so i can not scan my face can be solved by finding a friend with one but still no ipd adjustment means it can only ever be for you so the joy of sharing it with your friends is null plus your face shape being what it is built for still cool if you have the money to splurge but for me i enjoy sharing vr with people too much to lock down an expensive device to just me especially if i want to sell it a few years down the line no controllers extra cost then unless you are already in the ecosystem base station only undeniably the most accurate tracking method but poses additional cost and requirements restrictions no option for wireless would be nice to have an additional strap module that could strap to the back plug in to that same usb port on the side that has an onboard chipset for wireless streaming with an integrated battery as i will admit i am a prude for being able to ditch the wire when playing overall impressive and those of us that do get this are gonna be ecstatic but it is gonna be a hard sell for the majority of vr users i think might be the perfect headset for game devs that wear a headset for most of the day every day and want something tethered and always just on their forehead and ready to go yeah its super niche but i can see its use case price pcvr is my main hobby so i do not mind splurging since i do not spend heavily elsewhere anyway no iphone my friend has one not a huge deal for me ipd issue i already have an index and vive og so i already have other things for people to play with no controllers i have 2 sets of index controllers already for the above no base stations already have 2 sets of basestations set up in 2 rooms for the above no wireless i have yet to try an inside out device that matches the tracking fidelity of lighthouse tech used wmr quest 2 heard good things about quest pro but havent personally tried and i have used wired since vive og so at this point i come to deal with it and yeah like you mentioned i make mods in unreal engine and testing them out and having to put on take off peak thru it by lifting slightly gets annoying something more lightweight would be nicer really my only true downside for me would bt the fov i personally find a higher fov more immersive than a higher resolution because you see more of the world enviornment sde is not really that big of a deal for me when im immersed anyway tbh but for things like using it at a desk or watching movies you would not really need the full scope of the scene anyway id def like to try it out first hand tho to make a real judgement a lot of the comments are missing the point this is a luxury vr device for people with a lot of money who want to absolute lightest most comfortable vr headset for casual use you should consider providing a few generic cushions for those that do not want or can not provide a face scan it is probably the same fabrication process and you can just average a few generic ranges bonus points if people could try them on in the store if nofio is able to make it wireless i might seriously consider this edit lol downvoted for saying my own personal opinion what is wrong with some of you people spending a lot of money in hardware not made by a big company is a risky business unless your income is so much you find the expense small it seems a cool gadget though thanks for your in depth write up as well as the comparison to every other headset will i feel a major downgrade from the valve index i am looking into affordable wireless options definitely wont feel a downgrade besides the compression and some games controls might not work or be set up i felt a downgrade in fov and significan notly worse audio expected personally i was looking to replace the index but this did not quite make the cut also the controllers have a vibration tracking issue which i am hoping iss to be sorted in 5 2 i bought pico 4 and sold valve index because i have no space in my pc room to play with wired headset so i found myself not using it at all this is the truth index is better in every aspect pico 4 only has better resolution and lenses but i will tell you that index makes up for this with better colors and contrast i tried them side by side and index was visualy way better you can not even see real resolution in pico 4 vd has compresion native games can not run at full resolution if valve only upgraded resolution and add pancake lenses in the same form factor index would still be the best vr headset in years to come if nofio releases low latency wireless adapter for index all problems would be solved one more thing index is far better headset and pico 4 is not it if you have no headset get pico for a year or two and wait for next generation from valve if you already have index and space to move with it don t even dare to think about switching i did it because i had to i did just that index is better in many ways much brighter really better colors more comfortable better audio slightly better fov latency is really noticable in virtual desktop with pico i have wi fi 6 router and 4090 gpu so i can really push virtual desktop i still decided to make a trade due to pico s ease of use it is light wireless and ready to rock n roll index is lacking wireless mode for now nofio is coming soon and i really hate resolution on index it is really old by now what about the tracking the base station tracking is really accurate when it comes to quick snaps yes it is better i guess but both work fine so i never even thought about it i have also had just about every headset released and i agree with many of your points however the brightness i was surprised to find a non issue on mine at least i wonder if there is variance because i did not find it any worse than the quest 2 rift cv1 and better than pimax 5k and 8k the reverb g2 and index are both better however did you turn up the brightness to full in the pico menu also there is a noticeable uptick in clarity compared to a quest 2 for example not quite g2 because of the compression but it is still the best wireless vr headset out i think i also have not noticed anything like the plane turning you are describing i think there must be some variances as my pico very clearly had deeper blacks much more vibrant colours and was every bit as bright as my quest 2 even with the pico on 75percent brightness gt i think there must be some variances at this point i honestly think there is a serious problem with the quality control for the pico 4 the individual perception obviously plays an important role as well but the discrepancy i have seen so far between not as good as the quest 2 smaller sweet spot compared to the q2 no difference in fov brightness too low bad colours and noticeable better than the quest 2 huge sweet spot noticeable bigger fov decent brightness and colours seems to be a bit too big for me the sde you describe is more visible because the lenses are so sharp and like other posters mentioned when you tighten it up and yes there is ways to soften that facial interface so it is not punishment you get pretty much crystal clear clarity from edge to edge and a huge difference in fov from a q2 and brightness is lower but maybe this is exaggerated because you admittedly wear vr headsets without the gaskets on pico 4 is already a great contender with the quest 2 and it literally just came out a few software updates and revisions and this is going to be a solid pick for new vr users  wash it repeatedly with soap and water crush the materials in your hands and general use its made of foam foam breaks down compresses with use im sure youve sat in an old sofa or two you did not see the same edge to edge clarity as everyone else because you were not tightening the headstrap enough as you noticed when you took out the facepad your eyes have to be closer to the lenses to see through them properly the problem is that the facepad is so terrible that tightening the strap properly is literally painful aftermarket replacement options can not happen fast enough for this problem is i would consider the edge to edge clarity on par with oculus and valve the only headsets with relatively high edge to edge clarity i was expecting more but then again i am also spoiled by nreal air actual edge to edge clarity i have one too as well as quests 1 and 2 the resolution and clarity are far superior to the quests if you are not seeing that embrace the face pain and tighten the strap more i do not use the facial interface i never do on any headset i own because they all lower fov i have the lenses as close as possible like my eye lashes touching maybe i need to do a b comparisons but just based off what i remember i do not find it particularly meaningful i still have to turn my head to read the windows clock clearly i am not using the product as intended why is not it working as advertised oh ok so you are just an idiot ok i got you why i have just ordered pico4 yesterday and now wondering if i will get any fov improvements compared to quest2 considering i am using it with glasses so can not really get my eyes much closer to lenses it does have better fov but not a giant leap forward even with the glasses spacer the biggest difference is the increased resolution and edge to edge clarity of the new lenses wondering if i will see the edge to edge clarity if my glasses prevent me from tightening the headstrap enough it is not your glasses that will prevent that it is the pain from the terrible facepad gotcha thanks for the feedback as a quest 2 owner i am interested to read it how are black levels vs quest 2 everyone forgets to mention black levels they are a little better than quest 2 worse than quest 1 they are not oleds or even micro lcds so no miracles happening in this regard i would say the black levels are quite good better than q2 and index no one mentions them because they are lcd screens pretty much they are all the same unless they are firmware tweaked nothing special about the pico 4 lcd screens next to an oled they would compare just as you imagine gt no one mentions them because they are lcd screens pretty much they are all the same that is not true different types have significan not variances that is definitely not true quest 2 and reverb g2 are both lcd but are hugely different in colors and black level question i am looking to buy either a pico 4 quest pro or the nreal air solely for media consumption youtube videos movies web browsing how big is the virtual screen of the nreal air in comparison to the vr headsets i currently use my quest 2 to watch content in the bigscreen beta app and it feels like i am watching movies on a huge 200 inch screen inside a theater also since the pico 4 has a 4k screen resolution does the pico 4 look crisper and more detailed in comparison to the nreal is 1080p resolution in regards to movie watching regarding clarity look up the ppd numbers of pico 4 vs nreal air it seems nreal air is what you are looking for and by not buying it you also get to not support a genocidal regime lol ok buddy meta is literally not any better gt fov taking off the facial interface nets you like 20 degrees fov and the closer your eyes are to the screen the clearer everything is including the edges it is a huge difference can not wait for a better facial interface that has less plastic so you are closer to the lenses what is the max fov you get with your method it is weird how on other reviews people are turning the brightness down and some are saying it is too dark d vr headsets are pretty personal experience this is a thorough analysis i appreciate you bringing up the glasses it is just like pico 4 but with eye and face tracking if you are using streaming assistant you need to download vrcfacetracking in order for all that tracking to work do not know if it is the same case with virtual desktop also if you live in the us there is almost no point in buying pico since it is very hard to get there you can get it via aliexpress or ebay just as easy as elsewhere i do not think so you can buy it online did not know that i only remember pico spreading only in eu but have not heard any news about us get the quest 3 if your gonna pay that much quest3 does not have eye tracking what apps are you gonna use with eye tracking pico eye tracking does not work on pc they have not even released an sdk for it to help development it think it works i have seen some videos of it working with pcvr or with standalone apps then get a quest pro  okay shill but its much expensive than q3 or p4 pro only if you have to buy it for its dollar1000 retail price many retailers sell it for even less because well how many people are buying it these days for dollar1000 it was not a hot product even before quest 3 was out stock clearance if you go marketplaces it is even lower new if you go used barely used in many cases even lower still less than quest 3 just get a quest pro if quest pro is niche how niche do you think pico 4 pro will be for proper support for its eye tracking in pcvr games etc hardware can not be separated from software how many people on this subreddit have it probably 3 more powerful soc gt eye tracking unless you have a specific use case like primarily playing social vr or only plan to play pcvr with foveated rendering well am gonna use it for vr chat cuz am tired of changing faces with touching buttons do not get the pro version pico have separated the store to regular consumer one with games and professional with barely anything on it i have pico 3 pro and recently lost access to virtual desktop app as its not available on business store after the firmware update only way to fix it is to flash a non pro firmware and loose pro features not sure what is the difference between regular pico4 and pro one maybe there is no pro features edit nevermind pico 3 pro enterprise with no access to normal store and pico 4 pro consumer with normal store pico f up with naming real bad pico 4 pro is not enterprise stop mixing them up pico 3 pro is enterprise headset but pico 4 pro is consumer one it has regular store really that is stupid pico did such a shit job marketing their headsets and naming them lol yeah there is pico 4 enterprise and it is just called pico 4 enterprise and it has silver cover not gold one i have tried it and love it but i would not recommend it to most people first off it is only sold in china therefore you will have to go through the entire process of switching the software region it is not too hard and just requires a computer but it is tedious second very few games support eye and face tracking in standalone mode vrchat does not which is the main one i would imagine it is useful in they will work with most games via a leaked beta version of pico is desktop app but that kinda defeats the point of the headset lmao it is a wonderful device with a lot of potential but at the moment i do not think it is worth it for most people you get full access to all the games the normal pico 4 would have of course so it is still a headset that i am getting a ton of use out of just not one i am really recommending oh actually i do not care about standalone games am almost playing pcvr and heard that vd has been started to supporting facial tracking recently too ooo interesting i have heard that vd on pico is just a port of the quest version but that must not be the case if it is supporting facial tracking i would assume that more games would get native face tracking support for it too as time goes on seeing that it is not an enterprise headset like most face tracking ones are what i am most concerning about is its display as heard that it is worse than q3 which i am using now but am tired of changing faces by touching buttons on vr chat for vr chat i think your best option would be a vive headset with a facial tracker attached the hp reverb g2 omnicept edition also has face and eye tracking natively supported by vr chat but it is generally only available on ebay and whatnot as it is technically a business device yea i know vive pro eye has the best tracking but it is out of my budget the pico 4 pro may be your best option then but i am hesitant to recommend it as native support on pc apps for it is facial tracking is still limited technically you can not even activate face tracking in pico is pc app on any of the official publicly available versions only on a leaked beta version which does work but still something to note this was cool to see the different types along with their pricing missing the atari jaguar headset and the virtual io i glasses and google cardboard and gear vr be cool to show the cardboard price as dollar0 the new york times was sending them free to anybody to promote their content the diy community was doing it a year before google the open dive by durovis had the 3d printed project headset in 2012 amp 2013 durovis was gearing up around the same time as oculus dk1 it is amazing how much they got right they basically nailed the vive pro design they were just a little ahead of their time if they had pushed that once mainstream 3d gaming took off they could have really done something as someone who owned one u can tell you that they had no idea about the effect of frame rate on vr sickness flight unlimited was one of the few games that supported it and that was hurl inducing you could only okay it for a few minutes at a time it was definately ahead of its time but the concept also needed to be more greatly understood with a ton of info on all kinds of classic vr stereoscopic equipment and software it would be awesome if someone found a way to emulate classic vr games on modern hardware operating systems any titles in particular you are thinking of my limited experience was with a 2005 emagin trying to get flatscreen games to work in vr i do not remember many titles having proper support or being exclusive vr experiences the one that comes to my mind is i know the game was not very well received in its time but it is what kick started my interest in vr as a kid i know descent was vr compatible but you can actually run it in vr on modern systems with d2x xl and vorpx i am fairly certain there were a few vr compatible flight simulators and racing games too it is amazing the extent of what they talk about in the video actually resembles the vr landscape of today although when they showed that vr flight sim game running at 2 3 fps i was horrified they skipped one of the biggest leaps the virtuality system granted it was not consumer but that was due to how far ahead the technology really was i played on a few at the trocadero center in london awe inspiring dactyl nightmare ftw my first taste of vr same straight after alien war what a day that was ridge racer in a full sized mazda after burner r360 i also played the mech virtuality game in a pod unfortunately unbeknownst to young teenage me i have a slight astigmatism that made virtuality unplayable for me luckily it mostly self corrected i have had no issues as an adult i love getting stuck in on my quest and the victor maxx which was multi platform with a vga input though honestly it was hardly vr by todays standards just a screen strapped to your face lol the was actually a decent headset for the time i had one from about 1995 2009 when it finally broke irreparably and i decided to toss it granted it only saw any kind of regular use for the first few years of that it was very finnicky to set up but with stereoscopic vision and 6dof rotational but no positional tracking it was pretty impressive for the day quake 1 was my jam thanks to the mousemaxx driver that let you use the headset is tracking for mouselook sometimes i could go 10s of minutes without getting a headache same with the virtual boy it was stereoscopic 3d not virtual modern vr headsets are also stereoscopic how did you think their 3d worked or do you mean the lack of head tracking and ivan sutherland is sword of damocles if anyone is looking for more in depth info on these devices and a few more that were missed here they have sourced their info for this graphic from my vr headset comparison site there is also listings for a whole bunch of ar devices on there too and do not tell anyone just yet but i have started work on an update to get listings for peripherals and accessories as well i would be happy to have a go at generating graphics like this post with more devices at some point as well let me know if that is something you think would be cool to see there are images of the psvr2 out now btw i can not wait until next gen index with higher resolution current index is already amazing but with a bit higher resolution it will be perfection  for me the dream would be lenses which can be automatically adjusted to emulate an eyeglass prescription no more needing to wear my glasses inside the headset you can get prescription lenses i hated how my index crashed my glasses against my head so i got some lenses for dollar70 i removed the lenses from my glasses and duct taped them to the inside of my headset lol you could adjust the focus on gear vrs it was great for not wearing glasses but i hated having to clean all the lenses and screen every time i wanted to use it agreed i am happy with my index but can not help comparing the blacks to my iphone 12 is amoled screen yes that combined with at least 140 fov would be my sweet spot oh yeah 100percent agree with that while i agree 100percent i think there is a very high possibility that instead of releasing a revamped index with a higher resolution they are completely redesigning it to include next gen features like micro oled eye tracked foveated rendering onboard x64 computing and wireless pcvr unfortunately all this new tech means it will take longer to release waiting for a thing that may never exist is not something one should do why in the world might it never exist current index sales are doing great seemingly since they are like always selling out or accessories selling out and regardless if there was no index 2 there would be some successor does not have to specifically be by valve it might never exist because valve does whatever happens to interest them at the moment and that may not be vr there are already other better headsets from companies other than valve your post was about an index 2 which may never exist what would be a better alternative for pc vr versus the index i am looking for an upgrade to the og vive the reverb g2 for highest pixel density though i am partial to wireless pcvr with my q2 and i have yet to hear of someone disappointed going from the vive to the q2 wireless no more screendoor is a nice upgrade quest 2 hands down much higher resolution screen lighter can be used wirelessly with airlink or wired if you are into that i currently own seven headsets and the quest 2 is the best one i have had so far it gets about as much use as my index but there is really not index is the best all arounder right now there is headsets with better resolution that are lacking in other areas agreed i had no idea there were so many different headsets in just the last two years are any of them worth considering over the index or quest 2 most of them are not even released already discontinued business only or china only the only ones worth considering over an index are hp reverb g2 pimax vive pro 2 and varjo aero pico neo 3 is the chinese quest2 equivalent and might be worth a look in some business situations due to not needing facebook no they are either infinitely more expensive or worse experiences until the psvr2 comes out the choice for 99percent of people is index or quest 2 is facebook meta still a requirement for the quest 2 yes but rumors are that goes away in a few months also all the people getting their accounts revoked for not having an active facebook account have stopped personally i was very against the link but i broke down just this week and got a quest 2 very impressive tech worth it for all the game options well i can wait a few months thanks for answering i have both and only ever use the quest 2 even for pcvr it is wireless and does not require you to set up any base stations the compression is sometimes obvious but not very often and it is running at a higher resolution than the index anyway so i would not say it looks worse the field of view is a big difference for me plus the frame rate i still use both just got my quest 2 last week but i definitely feel like the quest 2 is more like playing on console and the index is like playing on pc is there a way to make the index wireless like the vive wigig not that i know of but if you want wireless then the quest 2 is the way to go having such a high resolution and frame rate makes wireless very difficult reverb g2 is much better than either of those in terms of raw clarity the g2 is so underrated imo i almost feel spoiled the clarity and brightness is so good compared to other hdms on the market just wish it had better controllers and a wider fov agreed i play sims so do not mind the controllers fov i made a little better with a thinner face gasket gt reverb g2 is much better than either of those in terms of raw clarity the go to porn machine i have tried just about all of them and the only two i would recommend are the reverb g2 reasonably priced and the varjo xr3 vr3 aero not reasonably priced if you care more about fov than refresh rate pimax instead of index do not forget the vive pro 2 buy from somewhere when you do not have to deal with htc support buy off amazon or something i found myself liking the vp2 over the index it is pricey but still runs the valve knuckles if you wish so you do not have to compromise to go vp2 over index sure if you already have index controllers the vp2 might be a good upgrade but the vp2 controllers are a hard sell they seemed kind of outdated shortly after they initially released with the first vive the vive focus 3 does not use them having said that they are still probably the best controllers for beat saber also the vp2 microphone is just bad you might not hear it unless you are doing recording but if you play multiplayer everyone else will be able to hear it definitely do not bother with vive wands buy the standalone vp2 headset and knuckles amp base station package from steam or somewhere the wands are outdated but htc pretty much said why would we spend tons on r amp d for an expensive controller when you guys already have the knuckles good point vp2 has a bit higher res than the index regardless of those 3 the index knuckles controllers are definitely the choice vp2 is dramatically sharper and clearer than index and has much higher resolution having said that its far from perfect as even on my replacement unit lenses are usable but meh with the god rays and glare index has a very clear screen door present triply so on anything bright but it feels well made and has the least software issues furthermore vive motion smoothing is a sad joke whereas index had a real reliable solution that is more like if you care about fov on paper over literally everything about the experience pimax terrible warping no shitty sound bad ergonomics bad lenses worse screens terrible support shit tier software still have to buy controllers and base stations etc not a fan have you ever used one the warping is only at the edge so for 95percent of the screen it is still more than other headset fovs the das has perfectly fine audio what ergonomics the das fits exactly like a vive pro the lenses screens are both fine you would actually have a point about their support before they started their us support team the software is no more shitty than oculus or vive since you really only care about a few settings if you are talking about the old software absolutely but for the last 2 years or so it has not been an issue you still have to buy controllers and base stations with the others if you have used one you must have used it like a few months after they started shipping units because within that first year they made a us support team and improved the software significan notly definitely a few i see missing from around 95 the virtuality i clearly remember playing rott and a few other games on it in a gaming cafe that was a decade ahead of its time and stupidly expensive yep i remember this it was powered by a commodore amiga and you stood in a circle thing with guard rails why is decagear on yet to be released it got cancelled did it not this graphic is not completely up to date or complete where does it say it has been cancelled go on their website it was canceled and they became some kind of bullshit nft or crypto crap company what a complete joke of a company i gave them 10 bucks for the preorder as somewhat of a hail mary and forgot about this headset in hopes that it wasnt a scam seems like everything was way too good to be true such a shame the big manufacturers got out of this space there are a lot of headsets here but there is also a huge amount missing as well particularly from the 80 is and 90 is actually disappointed none of the vr systems of the late 80 is are there an arcade booth style vr setup called virtuality i think was a product businesses bought afaik i wanna see the early working prototype stuff on here too though vr is so much older then people give credit for holy fuck the price of that canon headset at the very bottom is jaw dropping project cambria is probably the most anticipated upcoming hmd granted we do not know the final name and ps vr2 have you seen this video it outlines what the cambria will be like it is not really doing anything that other companies are not doing it even has the same processor as the quest 2 but it is a good collection of current available technologies full color passthrough controllers with cameras that can track themselves mini led screens pancake lenses a decent strap face and eye tracking and eye tracked dynamic foveated rendering the foveated rendering in particular is something i expect almost all new headsets to have going forward people will be excited for it because it is from meta but it is really marketed toward business and there will be better headsets in the near future full color passthrough is the most interesting feature quest 2 is great but the fuzzy b amp w passthrough is fugly i think the biggest reason why it is something else is the form factor at this point the form factor starts to be a big thing we will see if the release version is as small as promised too bad the uoled does not seem to be likely anymore probably too low fov or whatever i am not sure whether i personally waited for anything else than these two pointers controllers that work behind your back is cool i guess but let is be real that is useful only rarely well ok a proper fovated dynamic rendering would be a huge thing the competition at the moment have like this kind of dynamic rendering where the area of max detail is quite large due to the eye tracking still being so poor gt too bad the uoled does not seem to be likely anymore probably too low fov or whatever the fov of the cambria will be very close to the quest 2 which is not very wide so it is probably not that the more likely reasons for going with mini led over uoled is either brightness cost or availability in particular the pancake lenses it will be using need a higher brightness value and higher brightness is something that companies have been really struggling to accomplish using uoled of course the pancake lenses also make a much better weight profile because screen and everything else can be much closer to the lenses the greater comfort from that could be a very compelling reason for people additionally the lack of god rays but one thing i just remembered is that the cambria will likely be using a very similar cooling profile as the focus 3 because greater cooling allows much more performance from the xr2 soc and one of the biggest complaints about the focus 3 was the noise from the fans it will be interesting to see if oculus can succeed in significan notly reducing their cooling noise i am curious what your definitions are both for better headsets and near future are in this context genuinely so because as a quest 2 owner the cambria sounds compelling for my next standalone but without an upgraded chipset though with a boost to the xr2 as i understand i am having a hard time justifying the increased price for just rumoured improvements i really like my quest 2 and it is freedom but the fov and rapidly aging power are the biggest detractors for me the way i am seeing it with the current information is i am only buying cambria if the color passthrough and improvements let me use this with my pc wirelessly and seamlessly replacing my monitors but giving me a non gimmicky mixed reality setting without eyestrain due to poor visuals in which to do my work of course this is what was teased in that leaked teaser video and what has me most intrigued but for sure it is not confirmed that alone might be worth upgrading from my quest but just for the slight improvements my own emphasis in gaming it is a no go so what actually will be better and soon better meaning micro oled wider fov better risc socs better x64 apus possibly lower cost near future in this case just means within the next 2 years maybe 3 new risc socs next year xr3 is expected late 2023 and meta is also working with qualcomm on one tailored for vr and some better standalone devices will be built on those valve is likely working on an x64 vr device with a similar apu to the one that is in the steam deck but they may be waiting for a generational upgrade to make that feasible micro oled is likely going to be a major player in new headsets but the tech is just not ready yet but it should be soon the fov on cambria is probably going to be a bit better than quest 2 but not significan notly so as for the diminishing battery life there is really no way around that unless they have a user swappable battery the focus 3 has a user swappable battery in the back of the headset strap and so does the upcoming pimax 12k i have not seen any news on cambria about the battery with my quest 2 i have a battery velcro strapped to the back of my head strap and i plug it in when i see that my headset is battery is at 40percent or less if in the future that is still not enough i can just buy a better external battery the cambria is going to be quite a bit more expensive than the q2 the more i think about it though the more compelling the cambria is because of the full color mixed reality the pancake lenses the mini led screens the eye tracked dynamic foveated rendering and the on board camera tracked controllers but reception and adoption will depend upon the final price and whether they have worked out kinks like fan noise and visual clarity i doubt it will be the same sort of seismic shift that the q2 has been the varjo xr 3 has incredible mixed reality now but it is tremendously expensive lynx r1 has full color mixed reality and is supposed to start delivering this june june but i have not heard much about it recently the pimax 12k qled is supposed to come out by the end of the year and it is supposed to have an mr module but it is projected to cost dollar2400 and it is still a mystery if they will be able to deliver on all of their promises it also uses the xr 2 so could have the same problems with fan noise as the cambria could have i am most excited for the next valve headset but i could be waiting a very long time for that apple is headset is rumored to be coming sometime but i do not know when psvr 2 is coming soon which will probably be great for gaming but will be wired and probably restricted to the ps5 ecosystem also there is a very good possibility that meta is already working on cambria 2 quest 2 released about 1 5 years after quest 1 as well as the quest 3 a lot of the information that is out now is speculative so it is hard to be able to know a lot of things with certainty in general i expect there to be an explosion of next generation headsets in 2024 all good information thank you and more or less what i figured on the timeline but i was hoping otherwise i am looking at upgrading my workstation very soon definitely before 2024 and a new headset is in the cards if it fit the mixed reality bill guess i will just have to wait and see on the cambria lynx r1 will be out before cambria but it seems they have some supply problems with one of their cameras so it might not be available to everyone until later they have enough for all the kickstarter units plus about 200 we will just have to wait and see if they can solve the supply problem before cambria releases and of course wait for reviews to see if it is worth it oh absolutely there is no way i would buy it without units being out in the wild and reviewed it was not really even on my radar though i will have to look into it thanks half dive ended is it true they went back to the drawing board afaik in what universe did the oculus rift s release after the valve index i bought the oculus rift s and used it for a year or so before i ordered day 1 the valve index so that does not make sense to me there are things on there that are not vr headsets and the emagin z800 visor from 2005 is missing i assume others are missing as well not very accurate as i distinctly remember my first vr experience in hong kong around 1992 pretty basic arcade vr but it was three machines networked together and it was a good indication of the future i still cherish the virtual boy easy to criticize it but only because it was waaaay ahead of it is time it was cool i still have mine but it lacked games yeah nintendo never got a chance to put more games out because of it is low early sales i wish it had done better crazy to me that they were even able to hit a mainstream pricepoint at the time cheers i feel like this would be better if it listed whether they were 6 or 3dof also i do not think the halfdive is an hmd it was upcoming at the time even though it is canceled now but it still counts as an hmd on paper half dive was cancelled rip this is pretty outdated i remember my first touch vx1 back in dec 1994 i played wolfenstein and quake i was very impressed and i throw out after 15 minutes session lol its interesting to see how much vr has grown as the years have went on we bought the forte vfx1 for a nerd fest in 95 they had a 100percent return policy and we were fucking broke ass college students iirc it is head tracking worked off of the earth is magnetic field we got it dialed in for about 10 minutes in mechwarrior you could turn your head and it kinda sorta tracked and then you wanted to vomit everyone that tried it went whoa how far we have come while the relevant specs have not been released needed to fit in with this infographic i am surprised meta is project cambria is not on here it has been officially announced pending a full reveal and has some very nice sounding features it is supposedly coming out this year huge asterisk and currently the one i am looking forward to the most how have i not heard of the 3glasses d2 thing looks ahead of its time this does not seem to include the cardboard one i got for free from my work surprisingly it worked really well other than the fact that you would get the worst headache after 5 minutes cool that they added an nvis hmd from before the first oculus release i used this model at my university and we were very impressed with the oculus dk1 when it came out it was actually a better quality image than the nvis setup going from dollar20k research equipment to dollar500 consumer products was a huge leap do not forget the emagin z800 from 2005 with dual 800x600 oleds where is virtuosity looks like they are missing the victormax where is the atari jaguar vr headset the half dive got cancelled all these headset and not enough new games or ports of old games did not the half dive get cancelled i still think that for vr to become completely mainstream we need a dollar200 or less headset with at least the power of a quest 2 that is also very compact and lightweight like a smartphone aka future shit  i can not believe the current king of the hill the pimax 8kx is not there ohh you said the p word people had their fingers hovering over the downvote button just waiting for you glad to be of service that is a fringe headset rather than the king of the hill but should be on the list yeah unlike the qwr vrone 4k which is clearly a household item i have not heard about half of the headsets on the list and i consider myself a vr enthusiast had my og vive as a pre order and i own 3 headsets gave one to a friend i did not know best resolution with best fov is considered fringe but hey you learn everyday 5k is not either for some reason i wanted to know the fov it is only 150 apparently vs the planned 200 for the 12k oh boy all these options and opportunities and facebook still manages to corner the market here is to open people stop choosing it the problem is there is no alternative for wireless pcvr for example i do not have the space in the room where the pc is so i have to play in the other room therefore the only option for me was the quest 2 i would argue the appeal of the quest 2 isnt wireless pcvr its wireless vr without the pc requirement anyone can buy a quest 2 and be playing re 4 or creed or whatever right away no complicated setup or pc required the htc vive has a wireless adapter and can even be quite cheap if you get a good deal i won a bid for an entire set with wireless adapter for dollar247 50 and it is likely to get cheaper in the future give me a decent alternative and i will ditch my meta facebook headset tomorrow are people still shilling for the decagear xd when decagear headset is in yet to come out did you forget it was a scam xd fuck me i did not realize how many times vr was attempted and failed before what we have today there was never a full push like there is these days most of the early vr was companies trying something out then when it inevitably failed they would back out and not do that again most of the modern vr is a further iteration on the tech until it was actually ready for the consumer market the og rift and vive were really the first the rift was significan notly more primitive on launch they had envisioned it as a headset for sim type games but then the vive dropped with room tracking and motion controls and the rift had to catch up the early rift motion controllers relied on a system of cameras that had to be set up now oculus is ruling the roost with the quest 2 they have sold the shit out of em the inside out tracking has shown to be more than adequate personally i still prefer outside in tracking but they are making some real headway when it comes to bringing vr to the masses the touch controllers were planned before the vive was released i pre ordered the rift cv1 knowing full well i was in for another dollar200 when the controllers were ready also it did room scale just fine i never heard complaints from cv1 owners about it and i would have been one of the ones complaining if i were unable to play a whole host of room scale games initial tests were with the default two cameras placed diagonally which some people got to work but oculus realized it really needed three cameras so you could buy extra cameras for dollar59 some people even went for four which most of us thought was overkill neither headset was significan notly more primitive than the other and the great fanboy wars over whose magical teleportation device was better than whose became more important to too many people than the shared experience of a whole new medium and unfortunately they continue in some form to this day and that is not counting early prototypes in the 60s sword of damocles and the first commercial push in the 80 is vpl so i really have not been keeping track of hardware very much which of these operate without base stations and connect to pcs wirelessly i would like to not buy my next headset from facebook there is a key at top that shows which are pc console or standalone pah where is morton heilig is and ivan sutherland is headset gt the sensorama was a machine that is one of the earliest known examples of immersive multi sensory now known as multimodal technology this technology which was introduced in 1962 by morton heilig is considered one of the earliest virtual reality vr systems gt the sword of damocles was the name for the mechanical tracking system and not the head mounted display and is widely considered to be the first augmented reality hmd system although morton heilig had already created a similar apparatus known as stereoscopic television apparatus for individual use or telesphere mask earlier patented in 1960 the sword of damocles was created in 1968 by computer scientist ivan sutherland with the help of his students bob sproull quintin foster and danny cohen downvote to remove v1 5 i am so pissed that decagear has not released yet thank god i cancelled my first batch order in 2020 ugh i knew i would see virtual boy on this list that was not virtual reality i do not see the sulon q which could do this i did not know razer made vr headsets at one point very informative yep and opensourced but was very shortlived like most of razer is cool products rip razer phone 2 i have their hdk2 overall a pretty decent headset for it is time it lacked any sort of controllers but they had a bracket that could hold a leap motion in the front of the headset and give you ok ish hand tracking everything was open source and designed so that hobbyists could extend it i was working on developing tracked controllers and made some decent progress but then life got in the way it is currently collecting dust on my shelf quest 2 is my daily driver now damn the rift cv1 was ahead of its time wow never knew there were this many my first headset was the dell visor before i got the odyssey the fov is listed as 110 degrees though for both of them i am not sure if the decagear is still coming i am still kind of optimistic but the last official staff communication was something like 3 months ago it is not officially cancelled and i do not think it was really a scam but i think it may have just fallen apart missing the sutherland one from 1968 not to mention the whole line of evans amp sutherland ones which were the first successful ish vr headsets does anyone have any footage form the sega vr headset running was not the og rift dollar800 what is the deal with the crazy expensive canon one is it meant for industry production or something 12k 200 sheesh i am not seeing labo vr on there kind of you to put the decagear as an upcoming headset 1993 damn they knew about vr for a long time personally much more into the ar glasses that are out there like the nreal light i want a seamless hud that does not draw attention and fits into normal life as it stands currently vr is for transporting you into a new world you missed disney quest buy this man a virtual coffee anyone has an update about next gen index and pimax reality 12k qled missing a few i had a virtual boy only game i ever owned was mario tennis lol and the graphics were just red lines that composed of the images something tells me that we wont be seeing the roscosmos xr 2 any time soon i do not think vr systems that do not have 6 dof hmd tracking and 6 dof controller tracking should really be included these two things are a minimum requirement for modern vr its like including horse drawn carriages in a list of cars the experience is so different now it does not make sense to put them together with old hmds with little to no tracking damn my headset is old oculus rift it is pretty good though where is my google cardboard i thought vfx3d was 800 600 per eye also it is confusing there is no fov listed for virtual boy that seems very possible to find out with how many collectors have one also pimax 8kx at only 150 degrees where is that figure from specifically consumer vr headsets there is others not here that were sold to other markets like virtuality arcade systems was not the deca gear canceled i wonder if we will one day be able to emulate older vr headsets like the forte it would be pretty neat to experience old vr without paying collector prices there was a lot of headsets before vfx1 mostly pros i had i glasses half dive project was canceled anyone tried vive pro 2 vs the valve index vp2 looks amazing on paper so what is the catch it uses basestations also i think interesting to see the explosion in headsets released over the last few years vr is growing where is samsung gear vr my very first vr headset lt psvr we got there first and now we are the worst the year 2016 when rift vive and psvr all came out was amazing where is the valve deckard at are the quests the only ones that do not need a pc very complete thanks for sharing wth is helmet vision crazy good specs and crazy low price designed these while working as a visual futurist on back to the future ii 30 years ago do these count more here oculus quest 1 gang i had a vfx1 used to play duke3d and descent on it i had an emagin z800 released 2005 not shown i got to play half life 2 in 3d at a fuzzy 800x600 resolution it was not a great experience but it really helps me appreciate where we are now edit some interesting memories you needed a specific nvidia vr driver that converted most 3d games to work with the headsets at the time it worked pretty well the main issue was that most games have a 2d hud overlay that did not translate well the solution was to adjust the depth for each game so that the hud showed up where the screen was and the 3d worldspace had depth beyond that so the world had proper depth but it was like looking out of a window or space suit helmet rather than being immersed in the environment like we have today nothing really popped out visually the htc flow looking fly af almost would wear that on the streets only downside is that you would be blind this is missing all the hmds from the 80s and 90 i can provide pics if you like since i have access to the svvr vr museum nice to see this all in one spot but curious about some missing elements for starters sega vr was never officially released just some public demos you included sega vr but not atari jag vr which was essentially had the same outcome and actually had public demos and prototypes just like sega vr another issue is you included virtual boy which although was 3d hmd had no head tracking what so ever also was not color and no headstrap you included virtualboy but not victormax stuntmaster which although monoscopic still had primitive head tracking was a color hmd and head strap where is the meta cambria where is the apple headset this list is full of shit the valve index has a fov between 120 and 130 not 107 the does a great job of making the headset a more comfortable and versatile device rip deca and diver x headsets that were coming soon great the are so important to a game lover great the make s this virtual reality gaming experience perfect nothing wrong with a quest 2 for pcvr it is not too expensive and gets the job done i use a q3 for pcvr exclusively have not had any issues at all even the notorious airlink has been working flawlessly since day 1 under 800 is not budget the budget variants rn are quest 2 pico neo 3 4 q3 all the way quest 3 hands down and what about the issues like it link cables and stupid common dead pixels if you have a defective unit just return it for every post you see about a dead pixel there is probably 50 other users who do not have a dead pixel and are not posting about it virtual desktop and wireless pcvr gt link cable while quest 3 has more quality control issues than previous models there are not as many as there would be with headsets like pico for example the issues mostly pertain to wifi connectivity and performance some regions have issues connecting to wifi 6e and unstable wifi 5 performance some world regions just have different bands and channels used for wifi discovery and meta needs to update drivers another issue would be problems with pcvr stability in 120fps mode and av1 hevc codecs on 90 it works well in case of dead pixels you can just replace the unit right now the most connections issues happen in eu i think quest3 is by far best of them do not worry about issues because every headset potentially has them thank you for your submission to r virtualreality prince afterburn it seems you are new here so we would like to introduce you to some helpful community resources discord channel connect with fellow vr enthusiasts in our vibrant discord community from events to giveaways and a dedicated support section you will find plenty to engage with wiki amp faqs have questions our comprehensive and faqs are here to help headset advice megathread if you are seeking advice on which headset to purchase please refer to our it is a great place to get insights and recommendations from the community weekly game discussion curious about what games everyone is playing check out our we are excited to welcome you to our community i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please message compose to r virtualreality if you have any questions or concerns i was looking to upgrade for pcvr mostly flight sim read all sorts of reviews and almost pulled trigger on the varjo 3 but buying base stations and controllers were going to make it just as expensive as a pico the big screen beyond also has same drawbacks of needing base stations and fit is molded to your face so hard to share with my kids and friends anyway yada yada i ended up saying eff it and getting the quest 3 lol a point of clarification lighthouse is inside out they are just fancy markers for the headset to find fany markers that cost 75dollar a piece do it doggy style so you can watch x files so we can watch x files you and me baby ai not nothing but mammals so let is do it like they do on the discovery channel do it again now you and me baby ai not nothing but mammals duduodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodo i would appreciate input unfortunately it is not streaming anywhere black mirror irl op is just trying to play striking vipers with his homey instructions unclear had sex with polar bear nah this is literally a scene word for word from the entire history of you yep black mirror s01e03 entire history of you timestamp is roughly 22 01 or demolition man never change reddit never change reddit never change reddit never change reddit never change reddit never change reddit n  e v  e  r   c  h a  n  g e    r e d d  i  t  is that the end of the full house theme thats crazy youre crazy no way i wanna fuck a dragon finally the future is here read this in scott pilgrims voice i read it in frank the tank is voice from old school right after he took a dart in the jugular brooo me tooooo holy shit i have not seen that movie in so long i read it in frank the tank is voice from old school right after he took a dart in the jugular  what if it is a live stream of a camera pointing at themselves yoooo that is the future op can literally go fuck themselves what if they each had one but they streamed each other is passthrough so they were fucking themselves as each other cyberpunk 2077 spoiler gt that kind of happens between the main character and panam with a tank that linked their minds lt there is entire genres on pornhub of ppl having sex while browsing their phones and stuff so honestly the kink of having sex while doing mundane boring things is not really all that surprising i would think it is less weird if they were watching porn tbh but who am i to judge what they do behind closed doors next stop the dmv what kinna movies porn war films were watching better call saul right now bro is down bad for kim sexler same almost breaking bad you have no idea how hilarious this is lol keep slippin in that jimmy she is slippin on my jimmy til i kim no judgement my friend i am glad you and your spouse are happy but that response made me spray coffee on my phone and you continue watching mid fuck the least horny bcs viewers look man i am all for vr and not judging people but jesus christ you guys need to touch some grass i thought this was at least about having vr sex in vrchat or something not wanting to have your sex life interrupt your tv viewing fuck man lol why touch grass when he she can touch some d v   wtf bud sounds like really boring sex like let me just scratch this annoying itch can not let that get in the way of our binge watching i thought you two were gonna go all crazy and like be furries or something like that maybe you should try focusing on pleasing each other and turn the damn tv off it is frankly hilarious that op mentions they copulation while watching tv and just want to be able to do both at the same time and you all are kinkshaming them because they are not furries what a time to be alive well any kink at least has you focusing on the activities at hand not just phase out watching something else it is the opposite of kink shaming if you think about it not everyone has the free time to both fuck and watch a series and work a job why can not i do them all at once vr will allow us to do this at the same time op is a pioneer not a disassociated madman the future is now is it something like we love tv shows we love sex why do not we do both or is it because you last longer while you are not solely focused on sex or something completely different maybe you are going about this all wrong instead of wanting to have sex while watching tv have sex while doing other things cooking cleaning folding clothes eating and leave tv time for tv time or just do hand stuff most of the time only actual advice i have seen what fresh demolition man hell is this vir sex has been proved to produce higher orders of alpha waves during digitised transference of sexual energies but no touching what the fuck to watch while fucking ok you win working out is too hard just wear vr headsets instead lol this just feels dystopian in a way but do not let that change how you guys want to have sex they watch old home movies together quest 2 if you are into being watched during this is not quite as bad as the guy yesterday who wants an imaginary vr girlfriend but it is pretty nuts i guess it is good that two crazy people found each other gt i guess it is good that two crazy people found each other idk this post sounds like they are more interested in watching tv than having sex with each other lol i dunno why everyone is getting so judgey about it who tf cares how these people like to get their rocks off so it is a little unconventional but i suspect stuff like this watching tv etc during the nasty has gotta be more common than you would think anyway so long as they are both happy with it i say go for it there is plenty of lost souls in the dead bedrooms subreddit who would still prefer this kind of situation than what they are currently looking at no doubt gt i dunno why everyone is getting so judgey about it i think it is mostly the fact that sex requires focus and effort it is not something you can do while watching tv unless you are goal is for tv to take your focus off of the sex gt but i suspect stuff like this watching tv etc during the nasty has gotta be more common than you would think oh i think it is very common when said person is not actually interested in the sex gt there is plenty of lost souls in the dead bedrooms subreddit who would still prefer this kind of situation than what they are currently looking at no doubt that is incredibly sad i mean that is essentially a sex doll at that point i would much prefer masturbation over sex with a partner who is more interested in a tv show we do just fine with it we just think its hotter when we multitask by doing laundry or playing games during sex ok that makes alot more sense that is pretty crazy i think this is somehow worse is not that a fairly common idea and a commonly recognised use case or dystopian prophecy for vr we are just not quite there yet if i understand correctly but as a vr enthusiast i see titles like that on steam all the time they just seem very bland and uninspired from trailers and screenshots not to mention poorly dressed if at all fabric must be very hard to simulate and also i play games to get away from company and not to get more of it my overly large family is adequately providing for my need for human interaction to say the least but i can definitely empathise with people not having any connections in life at all for them in the future an ai companion could very well be the answer as long as the ai fidelity grows good enough the recent demos of midjourney and chatgpt are very exciting what is disappointing in my opinion are last year is vr titles  probably both just desensitized from nonstop porn use tbh it is clear they still have a libido it just demands more than a regular human being can satisfy they are watching better call saul and op is concerned about reading captions its like next level sad can not blame him better call saul is better than sex it is not sad at all 1 having sex in fun positions 2 watching tv shows together sad is 1 not having any sex with anyone ever 2 watching tv shows alone and no one to talk about it with op is living their best life probaly the first i has gotten that boring f i mean google cardboard you just stick you phone in and bam is now a vr headset pretty good to run anything your phone is capable and that is alot tbh well just trying to help this is helpful thank you have you ever used the cardboard was it easy to look at the screen im totally open to the phone slide in headsets but one i had in the past i found it very difficult to look at the screen especially when reading stuff or captions hold on i get that you watch something while having sex but wtf with the captions and reading are you watching a show about antique documents and accounting while banging captions enhance the show watching experience loud house ac i guess lol i believe you are trolling us and even if it is not true this is some comedy worthy material now i am picturing two people with the typical unemotional face of someone watching a movie while one is on top of the other banging up and down apathetic and one of the two has squinty eyes and is totally concentrated on reading the subtitles of something like the big bang theory with the laugh track going in background lt girlfriend moans gt keep it down i can not hear what dwight on the office is saying up the difficulty and try to read the subs while going up and down it is hard to hear the dialog over the wet slapping sounds i am starting to think it is a single guy who wants a headset to watch videos but he did not want to miss the opportunity to say he sexs as to elevate his status there is no way this is real you overplayed your hand man now people know you are trolling haha i wish other people do not like captions who does not like captions am i right i am a pro caption guy sue me i can read fast and like knowing what people are saying on a show do not listen to this guy google cardboard is terrible it only detects 3 degrees of motion rather than 6 so it feels like your head is stuck on a spike easiest and best solution is a quest 2 fully wireless 6 degrees of freedom headset bonus you can compete against each other in beat saber after you finish your other activities if watching tv is the goal cardboard seems ideal for this application the lower dof is a feature at least do an oculus go this is a much more comfortable and better performing version well is pretty light and the one my little cousin had was well made so it was comfy but not too much since i use glasses and that does not help too much but google cardboard is not the only one if you want to keep it cheap maybe check out the vr phone headset one day i was just doing a mall strolling and found cheap made vr headset for phones since the lens are the most important and if you can adjust for your eyes gonna snap a pic from the one a have it was dollar12 99 i do not use reddit too often so it will take a while edit 1 here image real water this is the real answer it is light and just need to make sure it is secure will not do games but if tv or videos are all you want this is great yup not cheap but with a nudity friendly phone holder itd do the job perfectly r vrcirclejerk somebody make it a thing edit would ya look it that dude just get a mirror you can aim at the television most vr headsets will trap heat and make you sweat and be uncomfortable there are some lightweight devices like the nreal but they are expensive solution is not vr watching tv is not what vr is for what you are wanting are video goggles but if you want to both watch a stream quest2 has some streaming apps but what one person is watching in vr and the other is watching on tv are not in sync with each other you are watching two independent streams other people also threw around the word ar is that the same augmented reality applies imagery and overlays to the real world through pass through lenses instead of generating an entirely computerized image that blocks your vision of the real world so yea ar is a viable option for what you seek tho i am not knowledgeable enough to say for sure if it is better worse than vr for this case with my limited understanding of ar you would most likely hang a poster on the wall ceiling with a qr code on it and it would look like a working tv screen with the ar glasses on if you want a screen that floats directly in front of you regardless of where you are looking it might be better to do vr instead with ar you could at least see each other and not have your entire vision blocked i would maybe go with the nreal air or similar 400euros you should also be able to set the brightness to influence how strongly you want the video to occlude your vision nreal air looks cool too wrong application duh try the nreal air glasses i have scrolled too far to not see a george costanza reference clearly nintendo virtual boy i remember this episode of black mirror oculus go or vive flow are probably best suited sounds like you do not need a vr headset but ar glasses like nreal air or viture one this is genuinely the dumbest vr post i have ever seen try this one for a troll post based off the title of this one if you really want to see dumb i will echo what someone else already said i have flow it is the least cumbersome as it is small and light and looks like giant goggles glasses it has one major flaw though it requires a power supply to be attached so there is a cord involved might get in the way there are many advantages though with the form factor nreal makes glasses for watching video dollar300 on amazon i can not believe i am going to answer this for you in an actual serious way too vr headset would be too bulky what you want for watching tv or looking at a screen are these what the fuck are they still selling the htc vive flow that seems like the best option i am looking for a comfortable wireless vr headset primarily for watching tv oculus i guess in case anyone is wondering it is so i can watch the office while i am balls deep in my lady hopefully i can nut right when chandler says bazinga i will also be shocked if anyone comments on this behavior godspeed op please report back i feel like a tablet or laptop for one of you and set up with watch with friends would work some service that syncs your stream watching you could also host your own instance of big screen vr and stream one on a quest or something but that feels like overkill though this method would let you both watch the same thing why not use positions that let you both face the same direction i think it will be challenging to get it synced with a regular tv maybe if you used a computer to display on the tv then you could link the headset to the computer as well but that is not exactly simple to set up plus you will find it hot and uncomfortable and it looks funny a well placed mirror might work a lot better i say television but what we use in our bedroom is just a computer with a large monitor and online streaming services websites with vr you can fuck yourself this whole thread is wild does some incel have a bot army downvoting the good advice so weird i think you should do like google cardboard as others have mentioned to try it out first anyway do not let anyone kink shame you yeah for real like 90percent of the comments are kinda just asking op to justify their actions it was a simple ask and even pointed out that this sub is not for life advice but vr i am sure many are joking but yeah if i imagine how an incel sub would respond this ai not too far off maybe just get another tv or pc display to place it conveniently the oculus go might fit your needs they are likely cheap now and lightweight n real glasses have you thought about using the nreal air tehy are like ar glasses with hdmi in you can have the screen overlayed over your view and you do not have to worry about a heavy headset or tracking this is crazy as fuck but like i am interested well okay wireless is probably the way to go so some obvious options would be quest 2 pico 4 maybe even an arpara aio when that comes out that is a bit pricey for 2 minutes of tv watching so as someone already said google cardboard is an option i could understand however if your people of taste in which case your looking at an oled system most of which are wired samsung odyssey is the best price for performance the problem with the current devices is that they are not small they weigh about a pound and run about dollar400 and up so then you are looking at media player vr sets there were a few of these types of things a few years ago but i can not speak about what is available now i would believe an option would be for one person to wear the device and the other partner can see what is playing on a pc this would require something like a meta quest using air link you do not want to deal with cables so again this gets a bit pricey video goggles with like a phone holder are a cheap solution if you want something more immersive you could always grab quest 2 and buy erp ready models on booth for interactivity in vrchat private rooms my wife and i did something similar with the quest 2 the hardest part was the boundary thing in quests ui but otherwise it was a lot of fun honestly any headset you can slip your phone screen into just download an app on your phone to watch media in vr slide it into a headset with a compartment for it boom sex and entertainment other solution oculus quest 2 you can get something a bit smaller than that glasses with monitors have been around a while never a popular product but you can find the odd ones out there this seems to work well for you the future is now old man haha you funny man i would suggest the meta quest 2 it is small and if you can make a ponytail with your hair and put it over the headstrap it is really comfortable also it allows passthrough both during a watchsession as the background behind the screen as well as per quick double tap on the side instantly pausing the movie application for passthrough passthrough allows you to see your surroundings through the headset camera allowing you to reposition yourself in the realworld without taking the headset off but still seeing your surroundings it is a standalone device meaning you need no computer to run it but it is not super cheap at around 300 400dollar thank you op for bringing some good fucking content pardon the pun to this sub i would not go past google cardboard where cost is concerned for this vr is a different beast from just watching a flat screen and you do not know whether you or your partner is particularly vulnerable to vr nausea if it did not work out i would expect it would be difficult to return or resell a pair of quest 2 is with uh stains aight despite how hilarious i found the idea of 2 people shagging while wearing vr watching tv shows what came to my mind was sonic x lmfao ill give my recommendations theres the oculus go which is light only has 3 dof but thats all u need for tv porn some of the more basic games theres the quest 1 vive with wireless kit so long as they have a pc if tlyou are fine with a cable theres plenty of wmr headsets for cheap personally i still havent found a vr headset more comfortbale than the vive focus 1 maybe the vive flow would be good for sex stuff i can not say personally as i havent even seen one in person but i know its light and quite comfortable from what ive heard i hope any of that can help give some updates on what tv shows you watch next time yall go at it this just sounds like r freeuse with extra steps itt a bunch of people mad that two loving adults are enjoying themselves just get a quest small portable cheap ish alternatively get a couple of mirrors even cheaper although people will absolutely know why you have got mirrors all over your bedroom but who cares you enjoy your shit wow what a revolutionary solution to the age old problem of not being able to watch tv while having sex i am sure no one has ever thought to just stop and focus on the sex itself or to try different positions that allow both partners to see the screen but no clearly the only solution is to strap on some vr headsets and completely detach from each other and the physical world keep on prioritizing screens and media over genuine human connection dude girlfriend name is rubber cylinder both of you get a gym membership it will be cheaper and you will enjoy looking at each other instead of the tv or vr during sex again this is not relationship advice its financial advice it is the cheaper option hey op just wanted to drop a comment saying fuck all the haters in this post if you and your partner are happy that is all that matters butthurt e boys gonna butthurt as for headsets there is not really anything on the market at the moment that does what you are looking for in a decently lightweight form factor the new valve headset deckard sounds like it would probably have the display resolution etc that you are looking for but it is likely to be very expensive at release good luck in your search we have taken another step to the future folks oculus quest 2 i guess i once had my wonderful understanding adventurous wife let me have sex with her while i wore my vive i loaded up a model of mercy from overwatch in mocu mocu dance and well you get the picture amp x200b nope i do not xfiles first this is rediculous second the nreal glasses seem ideal for this you need a quest 2 pro this has color pass through cameras you could place the virtual tv screen anywhere on a wall on the floor on your partners body and still get an occasional glimpse at other things in the real world around you they have glasses with screens in them on amazon probably cheaper to get another tv and put it on the opposite wall google cardboard and now we are in the cyberpunk genre honestly ar glasses like nreal air might be a great choice they are glasses so you can still see around you they are light and easy to wear while moving around a lot and they are relatively cheap compared to other vr headsets is this in a george costanza kind of way you want to combine your love of sex with your love of watching tv or is it more each of you enjoying virtually having sex with another no plans to virtually have sex only want to have a view of the tv no matter where the person most inconvenienced is looking was not there a black mirror episode about something like this like not exactly but kind of close do not do it buddy this same situation happened in an episode of seinfeld where george ate snacks while having sex and came to associate pastrami and cheese with arousal if you keep going you will have to hide your crotch any time you see a television or vr headset i have heard of putting a paper bag over someone is head if they ugly maybe you just need 2 paper bags please update us how this goes my solution is more tvs was not there a sylvester stallone movie about this very thing anyone giving you shit in the comments suck people should be free to be into what they want assuming they are safe and consenting adults bro rarely do i get surprised these days but this surprised me lmfaooo bro out of all of the activities in life you can mix together genuinely enjoying a show and having sex go the least together why do not you have sex and then watch your show once both of you have orgasmed that sounds a lot more enjoyable to me but then again what do ik i do not think you can even hold most of the vr headsets on your head during sex especially if the positions are weird enough where 2 tvs screens are insufficient even if it holds you will probably get a headache or nausea from the tight strap and screen shake might be viable for one of you if you just lay down and look at the ceiling during sex i heard that htc vive flow is pretty comfortable for media consumption but it is definitely not cheap you should rather just buy a headstrap for your phone if you want to watch porn and roleplay or have sex with your avatars that is whole another story but i presume it is not the issue here i have tried this it fucking sucks good for jackin off tho livi nothe dream brother livin the dream prob a quest i would assume but i do not think there is anything really small out yet people are weirder in the comments than op anyway quest 2 since it is standalone but it is probably not great if you really just want to watch tv it is kinda heavy uncomfortable and you will both sweat more than usual if you are looking for something like that black mirror episode it will make more sense though also the position you are looking for is mentioned in this song i would like to watch that in vr without even reading the entirety of the post i will say 1 whichever ones do not require cameras for base functionality degeneration of our society nvm i got you son get this little fella here viture one xr glasses cost less makes mor sense because u can see your partner and watch tv or porn you might be looking for something like the nreal glasses style headset they look like sunglasses and are meant for ar but you can put blinders on the front to turn them into vr they are very thin as far as vr headsets go and they run on usb c to an app connected to your phone or to a pc this thread is amazing thank you reddit op am i understanding correctly that your dream setup would be two sets of goggles one for you and one for your partner that would allow you to watch the same streaming content simultaneously are you wanting to blind yourself so you can see only the screen or do you and your partner want to see each other is bodies with virtual floating screens just added to your environment i am imagining it would be pretty hard to enjoy better call saul while intimate together outside of doggy style i did some digging and the vufine wearable display smart glasses might do it on a budget if budget is not an issue i think the epson moverio would fit the bill i recall seeing mention of some people trying that before though maybe a couple years back i definitely want to try it so many intriguing possibilities ignore all the people who are saying it is weird and crazy people are always such prudes about stuff but in a few years i am certain at least half of them will be trying it themselves and there will probably be special apps just for it as far as form factor could be a good candidate for this as it is very low profile and much closer to a pair of glasses though it still uses an external wired power bank and you would probably have to jury rig some elastic to clamp it on depending on how vigorous your activity levels are i would probably start with those as a base if i was going to attempt this now in a serious fashion but they are five hundred bucks a pop though and not good for much else beyond very light content use it is possible they do a fully standalone version in the next couple of years though since google cancelled daydream i am unfortunately not sure how well phone based vr works any more as daydream does not run on newer devices and you may have to hunt down and side load apks i used to stream from plex on pc to daydream all the time worked great but i do not know how tricky it would be to set up nowadays super inexpensive option which i would seriously consider oculus go are were very nice light inexpensive stand alone units that are unfortunately not made any more but were ideal simple vr media viewers with ok resolution and they can still be used for streaming video from pc with less than dollar100 on ebay each sometimes a lot less you will need to make a meta account though to use them probably the simplest cheapest solution right now for a very lightweight device as pointed out there are some relatively inexpensive video glasses devices but it depends whether you want to be only viewing traditional 2d content vs vr video i think vr content is obviously much more appealing for the use case but it does sound like you just want to watch tv but a device specifically made for vr will give you both options to each their own vive flow is probably what you want light wireless bluetooth connection to your phone and can play movies videos with a theater like feel streaming sites should work too iirc george constanza is that you real advice you should get the nreal air it will most likely be unsupported sooner rather than later as bytedance has stopped making consumer headsets is there many bugs in terms of pcvr to be aware of i will most likely be using it for that only and immersed from time to time one thing to notice is that most games if not all of them got no configuration for pico controllers so they show you quest controllers instead and sometimes you will miss a function on the controller in my case i can not open the menu in zero caliber because button mapping not working half life alyx showed me valve controllers and showed me how to use a touchpad i did not have most of the time you can download a custom controller calibration from steam so you have a workaround they have already started unsupporting it live streams are gone for the past two months that is not entirely true we still have os and streaming assistant updates on the way the beta launched couple of weeks ago and also got new game releases last month arizons sunshine 2 i just think they are focusing on a vision pro knockoff rather than going the quest route official word on this what do you want to use it for for pcvr it is perfectly fine for standalone i would highly recommend a quest 3 bytedance laid off half the pico staff recently and it is not sure if there will be any other pico headsets so i would not invest in pico is game store your money could be wasted and even for pcvr gaming the quest 3 is imo the better choice if you are not tight on money i had the pico 4 and liked it very much for pcvr upgraded to quest 3 and sold the pico 4 because i like the quest 3 better the pico 4 was definitely a step up from quest 2 due to better lenses and higher res the facial interface was atrocious though bought a new amvr one that actually fit and had no light bleed on the sides like the stock one i also did not like the fixed headstrap many people complain that the quest headsets need 3rd party headstraps to be made comfortable i actually see this as a big advantage because there is many to choose from so that you really can find the right one for yourself the fit of the pico 4 strap was ok but not perfect what is also annoying is that it does not come with headphones that alone is not so bad because you can just use your own right yeah but somehow they thought it would be a good idea to not include a 3 5mm headphone jack to easily connect any headphones instead you have to buy a usb c to 3 5mm adapter that ideally also has an additional charging port it took me a lot of time to find one that actually works and supports up to 18w charging power and it cost me an additional 20 eur having the adapter always dangling from the usb port was not optimal and i hated that pico cheaped out on the 3 5mm port also i thought the displays to just be bright enough on 100percent a bit darker and it would have been not acceptable for me also worth to note that the image calibration is a little warmer so tends to go into the reds compared to quest headsets the controllers are fine especially compared to the bulky quest 2 ones however i like the ringless quest 3 controllers even more yes it will be primarily pcvr and the only experience i have had was the quest 2 for the past week or so borrowed from mate not mine where i am the pico 4 is a third the price of the quest 3 so that is a pretty big no in that regard if you really only want to use it for pcvr go for it does your friend who owns the quest 2 also use pcvr because do not underestimate social aspects if you want to play with your friend together online and he does not play pcvr but standalone not every game supports cross platform play so it is better to be on the same platform but yes the pico 4 is a very nice wireless pcvr headset and for 1 3 the price compared to quest 3 it is the better choice but please make sure you can use it wirelessly wireless vr gaming is just the best so if you do not already have a capable router consider buying a dedicated wifi6 router nah he does not do pcvr but he also does not use the headset for much except when he has friends over hence why he was ok with me borrowing it amp x200b by making sure i can use it wirelessly would the limitation only be on the wifi connection maybe he would use it more often if he had a friend he could play with i play walkabout minigolf and elven assassin regularly with friends online and we are all on quest 2 and 3 headsets so it is super easy to all communicate via quest group call then we just jump into the games running standalone on all quests and have fun anyway cross play limitations stem from the game no matter if you have a cable connection or wireless if you do not want to play online with friends or accept that there is many games that are not cross platform compatible then go for the pico 4 it is a very capable and fine pcvr headset fortunately some of the most liked coop multiplayer games have very good crossplay support the mentioned walkabout minigolf i also play regularly with friends and we have a mix of quest 2 3 psvr 2 and pcvr works flawlessly appreciated it gt where i am the pico 4 is a third the price of the quest 3 so that is a pretty big no in that regard it is really interesting to see different people talking about vr prices in wherever they live here a pico 4 is the same price as a quest 2 and that is about 4 5s of the price of a 128gb quest 3 even so slightly less and half the price of a 512gb quest 3 i owned one since launch and the biggest issu is the comfort the fabric they use on the facefoam is shit its worth it to buy amvr facegasket next big issue is if you want to use headphones and powerbank at ones you need an adapter with jack and usb c so you can charge the headset while playing or bobo vr batterypack for pico how much money do you want to use on the pico untill you reach quest 3 price pico 4 has better bionocular overlap than quest 3 the picture quality in pcvr is almost the same in ultra using virtual desktop both headset have umstable wifi connection not all but many does thanks yeah the q3 is almost 3 times the price of the pico where i am so honestly the accessories will not be that bad i have heard the edge clarity is better on the q3 then pico though or did you just mean the ipd adjustment when you say binocular overlap the picture overlap is better on pico edge to edge is little bit better on quest 3 but you will only see the different if you swap between quest 3 and pico 4 its not like wow i can not use pico 4 cause quest 3 has little bit better edge to edge clarity for me there are no big issues with it but here are my biggest gripes being a standalone headset the controller tracking fails outside the range of the headset cameras i much prefered the full room volume tracking of my old pcvr setup with wall moutned cameras can not throw things perfectly naturally with a standalone headset for example far fewer standalone app than meta also fewer sidequest apps often the lenses are made with slight imperfections that causes slight visible wavyness when you move your head sideways with obvious horizontal elements in the image my left lens is perfect but my right lens has this slightly it is only noticeable in the menu though if you are only using it for pcvr these will not matter at at all but for me the worst thing about the global pico 4 is the way the global non game resources are very limited compared to what is available to the chinese users that includes frequent engagement with the user community livestreams larger selection of videos and films public viewing rooms douyin interactivity etc no headset is perfect and there are always minor things you wish were different so with that said the only big issue i would say is the default facial interface is pretty awful both the amvr and geekvr interfaces are very good though only other semi big issue is the pico store has significan notly less in it than the quest store if you are strictly doing pcvr this does not matter at all but there are some good standalone games and quite a few of them do not come out on pico for the price though it is an incredible headset i would say the worst aspects are the standalone software support the lens glare internal reflections the screens are a bit washed out in terms of colour and contrast compared to the competition no 3 5mm headphone output and the pico pc streaming software is some of the worst i have seen super comfy and excellent sharpness though and obviously the streaming side can be taken care of by other solutions like virtual desktop if i did not have a q3 here to directly compare it to i would be totally happy with it for pcvr the worst aspect is it is wifi you will fry your brain i am not even joking i was using it every day for almost a hour i started loosing the sense of touch in 2 fingers of my left hand targeted headaches and loss of balance i did not know it came from the headset i stopped using it for a while and everything came back to normal until i would use the headset again i am not sure the wifi is really off if you put it off so just turning it off alone does not help yeah i tried in fact i tried many times just because i did not want to not use my headset anymore it may sound a bit nuts but i swear i am not a conspiracy theorist haha i would not buy another headset that has wifi or even all the electronics just the screens starts to sound safer for me hope that helps apart from support issues it is very good value and it is comfortable out of box it is a bit dim compared to quest and colors are bit washed out due to cheap lcd panels comfort may depend on where you bought it and your lineage the asian market version has much less space for the nose it was murder on me least comfortable headset i have ever worn by far compression and comfort the bitrate is much lower than quest so the artifacts are very obvious the facial interface is pretty much a torture device recently got one because i did not want to spend twice as much on a quest 3 as i mainly do pcvr and i would say the only thing that bugs me is the glare and reflections in the lenses as it often makes things look like my lenses are fogged up though this has happened to ever vr headset i have owned so i am not sure you can avoid it everything else has been a blast is that reflection from light leaked from outside env new to vr and not sure how things work just yet no say you are looking at a bright screen on a black background the brightness of the screen will make a bloom effect on the black background around the screen making things look foggy or smeary this will happen any time there is a big contrast on screen which is more than you would think especially in vr thanks gt wireless streaming or hands tracking i believe pico does not have to invent anything now just add all quest features should be way quicker to copy things pico had wireless streaming before oculus did pico made wireless vr headsets before oculus so if anything the copying has been going the other way pico did it first well it would be worse if that pico streaming assistant has been developed for years and all they got is this super basic app which is worse than the virtual desktop there on my quest 2 i never even did use virtual desktop as default airlink works so well with the same xiaomi wifi6 router at max 200mbps gt which is worse than the virtual desktop people that actually use it properly say it is better the ones that do not just have not configured it properly gt it actually has quite a few benefits over virtual desktop thanks i did not know the resolution is controlled through steam and it affects everything i will give it a second shot looking forward receiving my pico hands tracking is available in developer mode although very slow atm and very clunky q2 is way better with it also you can not use the oculus store q2 exclusives in pc vr if they would not have ran on the pc vr oculus headsets agree hands tracking 2 0 is better on quest and 2 1 will be coming soon but again quest has released hands 2 0 less than 4 months ago and if pico is already promoting games like unplugged air guitar it should take even less to put 2 0 tracking on pico wait u can play oculus quest 2 games or you mean oculus rift game only as i know yes almost all quest exclusive games are available in oculus store on pc and virtual desktop allows to run any quest store pc game on pico with just one click and there are only a few games left on onculus store as exclusive as pretty much every popular vr title is available on steam and even cheaper now too you could have avoided some confusion by using the more specific oculus rift store or oculus quest store rather than the generic oculus store the pico can play all oculus games provided they are on the rift store sure if you do not mind the chinese government harvesting your data and spying on you then it sounds great google did it first you never forget your first i do not disagree all the big tech companies do this to some degree the issue is about handing over access to you info to a hostile foreign government that sees you as less than human exactly we do not like hostile foreign governments here in eu and chinese did us nothing wrong but someone else is very upset about eu being friends with enemies it is just that they are not our enemies one would think that given the current state of global affairs particularly what is going on with russia at the moment people would understand that its dangerous to do business with countries that do not respect human life but hey that is just my take and just to be clear i am not american i am not pro american either it really seems like the world is just making the same mistakes that lead to ww2 that is my opinion your entitled to yours as well that is one of the great things about democracy too bad the chinese people do not get to have those freedoms but hey that is not your problem right that is fair in the households of sensitive government or business personnel i could see a risk but i doubt the ccrp has an intelligence interest in a slp is gameroom your probably right but why would you help fund their espionage and who knows what they do with the info and what info they collect exactly would you purchase a headset that you knew had direct links to the russian government given all the stuff going on i would hope the answer would be no so why would the answer be different if it is chinese they are bad actors on the world stage it is silly to welcome them into your home with cameras and access to your home network they may be i also can not assume nefarious ends i have definite bias but no proof of intent also i can not say i am directly funding except if taxes or fees are collected by a govt which might be the case for other manufactured goods from a given country besides pico is emergence signals competition in a free market i support that competition is good but pico is not just competition it is a chinese government puppet the concerns surrounding it are just too massive to ignore simply for cheap goods then meta and sony need to get with the program i think it is funny that germany will sell pico but not quest ya your absolutely right we they all need to do better germany also happily took russian gas but and levied empty threats at them for the longest time including many years leading up to the war when they could have switched earlier with much less pain so yeah germany is mostly driven by profit and convenience i prefer sending my data to chinese instead of us communist party why do you think all big tech gets away with tax evasion monopolies and all other stuff above the law maybe they are already working for the local communist party sure ok lol your ignorance is amazing lucky for you you have the freedom to think for yourself and do not have to worry about being disappeared in the middle of the night for voicing your own opinion sadly the same can not be said those unfortunate enough to live in places like russia amp china enjoy your freedoms provided by democracy freedom to be silenced if the opinion does not fit current agenda business famous people canceled for not supporting the current thing the land of free and democracy pointing fingers do you not live in a democratic nation enjoying the freedoms it provides the fact you on here sharing your opinion points to the answer of yes it is pretty nice eh you know speaking your mind without fear of being punished is it a perfect system hell no is it better than what happens in russia amp china absolutely i for one will sleep pretty good tonight knowing that no one will come for me in the middle of the night because i spoke out you should too lmao you do not live in china so you know shit about china i am so smart because i trust what the us talks ab china currently live in china talk shit ab the government and have not disappeared in the night seriously yoy should consider going to china once in your life compared to the usa chinese does everything better you think your country has better economy not anymore you think your country has better community not anymore you think your country has stronger army absolutely not anymore lastly the chinese has their own internet sites so you do not have a chance to see their freedom when you are not here i am not pro china or smth like that but i am a traveler do not believe anything the government say see it with your own eyes so you would rather let mark zuckerberg harvest it um ya rather than a communist regime that is hell bent on destroying democracy absolutely are you talking about brandon hell bent on destroying democracy yeah that is a no brainer just for the comfort of having pancake lenses with the weight at the back i am just here to complain about 3d pie charts they are the worst and nobody should use them thanks for coming to my ted talk and have a good day yeah what is the point of dividing things by size then distorting their size with perspective it looks neat i guess but i would take a nicely done 2d pie chart any day thanks for the feedback i will make the next one in 2d i thought the 3d effect looked kinda fancy but if peeps fully hate that i will change it up it should also say all others combined not combines those are for a really realistic farming simulator experience on is alt account look at the watermark in the image on is alt account rofl nah although if op would like to continue reposting our posts that would make everyone on our team beyond happy i honestly did not think my chart would get any attention here so i only posted on our social media and i am guessing op follows one of these accounts and if op reads this i want to thank you for pushing us out there like this super cool even 2d pie charts 3d pie charts are just next level awful i applaude to your ted talk give me 1d pie charts or nothing i prefer 4d hyperpie i lol when i read this also why do not you like my pie chart would you prefer a bar graph i am making these every few days so i can make one more to your liking next time the way it is laid out it is difficult to both read the small labels and also see the whole chart at least on mobile i can only really view one side at a time the most important information is the labels and proportions if we are trying to actually compare it at a glance in this photo the rift s appears somewhat bigger than the index i really like the feedback the next one i make will be sized for mobile instead of only desktop as for the proportions i agree i had not noticed that before you pointed it out but you are right i will consider not using the 3d version next time as you are not the only one to point out issues with how it makes things look having the headset names or logos inside of their section with a large clear font might also make it easier to take in and compare them together i would get a valve index but valve will not ship it while promising to expand to other countries as well for the last two years unlike the oculus devices that were accessible in most locations in the world the quest2 is crazy value for what it is sold for there is no real competition at this point i wish there was but there is not and there will never be unless another company which can afford to lose money will enter the market the only competition for facebook can really come from the rest of the big 5 tech companies and only apple is currently developing ar and vr devices and at the same time i am quite sure they will not compete in the entry level market  ms also has some pretty big vr devs under their belt now as well as pc and console platforms wmr was mostly getting scraps fromhololens although like most they are were targetting ar as they thought vr would not make enough of a dent the quest is showing them that fb meta has a pretty good path to an ecosystem  they had a rather large setback about 3 years ago when their head of wmr before they called it that died in a car crash too add in the xbox one generational policy of no wired devices and that prevented them from releasing an xboxvr samsung and hp are the only ones who even made revisions to their hardware they just keep shooting themselves in the foot kinect was functionally only marginally better than what sony had the tech was more sophisticated though and was more capable nintendo and sony afaik had done a ton of research on controller less interfaces and decided it wasnt viable as a control scheme i think it was lack of feedback wasnt satisfying ms tripled down and spent a ton of money promoting kinect and it sold better than any gaming peripheral but sony and nintendo were right ms has the tech but they sometimes fail in ways only huge companies can to clarify i am rooting for them in vr against meta and love my samsung odyssey plus but wmr is sorely lagging while they focus on the admittedly more profitable corporate ar gt kortana i will grow old and go to my grave still complaining about what they did to the og kinect voice assistant my living room has never been as smart as it was in 2013 when i could just hop on the couch and go hey xbox let is watch some netflix and it would 1 recognize me 2 open netflix on my profile 3 grab something from my queue and start playing and then if you want to pause it to get a drink or something you just stand up i guess it did not all go to waste though the kinect tech is definitely living on in hololens and wmr and there is some really cool open source indie dev projects working with that hardware now psvr2 will be great but it is not gonna be that huge of a hit until ps5s are more available to everyone to easily buy high tier next when cambria comes out gt i would not discount sony and psvr you must be new here i do not think i have seen sales compared directly but they are pretty much the best kept secret on this sub for as little as anyone talks about them  my point is that discounting sony is r virtualreality is bread and butter asking in good faith is there really anything to talk about currently i feel like it is a separate market in a lot of ways unless psvr2 can work with pcvr and how exactly is oculus not a separate market there is nothing about vr that requires pc compatibility and this is the vr sub not the pcvr sub the top level comment was talking about the valve index so this discussion was about the pcvr market the quest can natively connect to pc which makes it relevant when talking about pcvr psvr cannot connect natively so it is a completely separate market completely agree with you oh yeah apples device will be expensive and old tech because it is an apple product i am hoping amazon will step in and make it a fair fight they have shown interest in gaming apple who make one of the most powerful socs on the market you mean their headset will blow the xr2 away but the problem is actually then releasing something valve i mean is not the answer literally right under our nose lol just like the steam deck if they set themselves to it they definitively could yeah i do not love that it is fb who runs oculus but there is no other company making headsets right now aimed at the general public i feel like while i would love to have the disposable income space and time to properly utilize a valve index the oculus stuff is just so much more approachable at this point facts i grew up in asia and i always wanted to get in to vr but literally so fucking expensive and i really had no experience with any vr system the quest 2 was an amazing starter ready out of the box and i personally have had no issues with it i understand oculus has a lot of issues both with the system or with whole facebook thing but its really hard to beat the price for what you get with the quest 2 the reason it appears cheap is because fb has you pay with your soul lol i just got one luckily i have literally nothing on facebook and do not count on using the oculus store which i hope will limit the soul selling thing when a next gen non fb headset will be available i will probably buy it regardless of the fact that it will be sold below cost or not facebook even tracks you outside of facebook a shit ton of websites still share info with facebook i have tons from the store but imo the best games in the quest are dr beef is ports and those just require the base games from steam unless you go to great lengths to block facebook they can track you and build a profile on you even if you never put any info on yourself i have never made a real facebook profile but yet the one time i tried to make a fake profile just to claim some freebie they actually had most of my real info pre filled in because my sister probably gave them a lot of that info i was so creeped out that i canceled the whole thing and i have blocked them completely at the dns level as well as any javascript or cookies trying to track me i am probably still being tracked but at least i am not giving them everything i always see this being said but can anyone actually back it up from my understanding ad renenue earns pennies compared to the walled garden shop and expensive accessories also how do people know more data is extracted and used compared to other companies facebook does not collect any more information on the oculus platform itself than steam or any other store does it is the fact that they track you across your entire life that people find uncomfortable steam uses past purchases and playtime to recommend new games on their platform to buy i do not think anyone has any issue with this facebook can use information about your life whether whether you frequent a rock climbing gym or read articles on cars online or interact frequently with a friend that plays mmos etc to to sell you things it is the breadth of what they know that is frightening to people not the depth from any one source if you have a facebook account you can see exactly how much information facebook is getting from outside their platforms if you do not have an account this data profile of you still exists but it will not be accessible to you it is really less about how facebook use your data and how they use the collective data that they have collected about societies and that is by unscrupulously selling it to any one looking to manipulate masses of people including the most vulnerable and susceptible and thereby providing easy access to advanced tools for bad actors to devastate society if facebook were scrupulous about how they used the data and what they did with it i do not think many would mind nearly as much the apps pay nothing zuck has been clear the quest hemorrhages money the point is to kill off the competition and own the future they do not it is all accusations and conspiracies i did actually pull data that both oculus and steam pull from me and guess what steam has a lot more data about me than oculus people like to pretend that facebook sends some burglars to break into their computers to steal their precious bodily fluids data and act like they are not actively giving that data away gt steam has a lot more data about me than oculus but one thing to consider since facebook requires you link your fb account that oculus data gets added to the reset of your facebook data and steam tracks you via utms as they list on their website aka sameway facebook does and so what ifnthey add your data to facebook accoint like can you give an actual issue instead of some hand wringing about targetes ads that is not 100percent hypocritical nonsense gt i did actually pull data that both oculus and steam pull from me and guess what steam has a lot more data about me than oculus i am going to have to see some proof on that there is no way that valve has more data on you than facebook facebook builds shadow profiles on people to the point that without ever touching one of their products they still know your entire relationship graph oculus may not be pulling that data directly but they are still getting it from somewhere you are essentially handing them the keys to add on everything else a vr headset and biometric data allows gt people like to pretend that facebook sends some burglars to break into their computers to steal their precious bodily fluids data and act like they are not actively giving that data away the problem is that if you want to enter the vr market at a reasonable price point you do not have a choice you can either pay dollar1500 to get a vr pc and an index or pay dollar300 for a quest 2 and then dollar500 down the line for a vr pc if you can even find a decent one in stock right now that cheaper entry and lower price point mean that you are giving facebook full access to a view of your home and mics for your conversations and activities whether they are actively using it or not is not really the point when they have already proven they will use that avenue for data in the past it is a when not if question gt i am going to have to see some proof on that there is no way that valve has more data on you than facebook i said oculus as in data they gather via your headset whatever extra data you give to facebook is collected via other routes such as using facebook do not use facebook no data for them gt the problem is that if you want to enter the vr market at a reasonable price point you do not have a choice and whose fault is that facebook for producing affordable headset or everyone else for refusing to produce affordable headset despite being capable of it people like to pretend facebook is sending some sort of black ops teams to tear down competitors when in reality it is simple fact of nobody else taking vr seriously gt that cheaper entry and lower price point mean that you are giving facebook full access to a view of your home and mics for your conversations and activities and we enter conspiracy land fun fact none of that shit is uploaded to any servers it remains in your headset you want to claim they are uploading your home schematics or listening on random conversations prove it actually prove it show the data being uploaded or data being on the server do not just quote the privacy agreement like a brainless zombie because if you do i know instantly you have no understanding of system collecting data is not same as storing data for example they collect hand data when you use hand tracking that is what the hand tracking needs in order to work once the data is processed in the headset it is discarded at no point does the data leave the headset you want to claim they are uploading all this supposed data to their severs prove it do not just be a mindless zombie that parrots oxi gt do not use facebook no data for them any opinion you have on this topic is null and void if you truly believe this it has been proven time and again that just using the internet will give facebook all of your data gt facebook for producing affordable headset or everyone else for refusing to produce affordable headset despite being capable of it facebook is not producing affordable headsets they are taking a loss on every headset they sell the only competitor in the space that could potentially do that is valve but that would damage their relationships with their partners it is anti competitive monopolistic behavior not some secret formula that facebook found gt oxi i do not even know who oxi is gt none of that shit is uploaded to any servers it remains in your headset mic data by its intended usage has to be uploaded to a server they use the same collect term for mic data that they do for everything else gt do not just quote the privacy agreement like a brainless zombie the privacy agreement is the literal document telling you what they are going to do and why it is the only proof consumers are going to get because that user data would be encrypted when it is sent out you would need access to quest source code or internal facebook documents for proof so no when you decide to throw blinders over your eyes of the proof right in front of you there is not any proof let me know how that is working out for anti vaxxers facebook actively collects the exact same data with the same wording in their privacy agreements for their other products you would have to be paid or incredibly stupid to believe that they wrote the same wording for their portal agreement as their oculus agreement and somehow are not collecting the same data if it is available  gt you going to a site with no facebook service attached does not give facebook any data that is a simple fact that is absolutely not true facebook has tons of trackers all over websites go to banfield pet hospital and make an appointment then look at the trackers facebook is not on there at all but is still getting that data you are grossly misinformed on this topic gt they flat out stated they are selling them at cost even assuming they are selling at break even on bom that is not at cost you still lose money on warranty support recalls etc they definitely were not breaking even when it first launched gt this is not some grand new evil plan this is console model 101 consoles have been doing this since the first one never mind razor and printer manufacturers hell i can buy a printer cheaper than i can get ink for it i never said it was new but it is still monopolistic gt the fact that valve is not willing to share of the profits from the software sales when they own 75percent of digital distribution market speaks more about their monopolistic behavior than facebooks i am not even sure what you intend to say with this valve has never attempted to stop a competitor they are in a market dominating position and take special care not to abuse it the closest thing to monopolistic behavior valve has ever done is launch the steam deck gt of course it needs to be uploaded in order for voip to work it does not mean it is stored case in point facebook says it collects your hand data they also explicitly state that data is not uploaded gt collecting data uploading data but they do not explicitly state that general controller tracking image data or mic data is not uploaded even the hand tracking section you quoted has a very specific line item to make sure they are doing what they say they do gt we do not store images or estimated points specific to your hands on our servers that reads that they are storing images and estimated points of something on their servers just not your hands otherwise there would not be a need for clarification if oculus did not store images and had no intention to ever store images they would very clearly say that in their privacy information as they did here gt we do not collect or store images from the headset in any capacity boom problem solved no more debate but they do not and will not put that i wonder why at minimum they have to store images from your headset for when the controllers lose tracking or drift that is valuable troubleshooting data they need to improve the product those images are going to have your home playspace in them it is literally unavoidable gt collect is not same as uploaded and stored only it is and this was proven when portal messed up and people started to realize their home information was being uploaded despite the privacy agreement using the same terms gt no you would just need to have nice little wireshark running to observe network activity such amount of data would be very much visible i do not think you fully realize how small these data packets are just because it is not a 24 7 feed from all 5 cameras being uploaded does not mean they are not uploading images low resolution mono color images are not hefty file sizes gt i notice you rather quietly refuse to acknowledge data difference between oculus and steam and instead move to different topics i ignored it because your list was not proof it is no different from reading the privacy information that you yourself discount you did not collect data you collected a list of what data might be collected the data that valve collects is about what i would expect valve to collect as a cloud save and storefront provider that information is also collected by facebook just not specifically through legacy oculus accounts gt that is absolutely not true facebook has tons of trackers all over websites go to banfield pet hospital and make an appointment then look at the trackers facebook is not on there at all but is still getting that data really i went to their site and there is facebook button right there they are using facebook service furthermore if you read their cookie settings page gt targeting cookies are linked to services provided by third parties such as like buttons and ishare buttons the third party provides these services in return for recognising that you have visited our website we use targeting cookies to gt link to social networks like facebook who may subsequently use information about your visit to target advertising to you on other websites so you want to try that again gt i never said it was new but it is still monopolistic so are you also calling for steam to be stopped before they take over the digital distribution or are you just being a hypocrite because you like steam but not facebook meta gt but they do not explicitly state that general controller tracking image data or mic data is not uploaded even the hand tracking section you quoted has a very specific line item to make sure they are doing what they say they do and steam does not explicitly state they do not upload anything of your vr data and yet seriously there is no point in discussion when the starting point is a conspiracy theories what can i even say that does not just get dismissed as well there is no evidence that they do not gt that reads that they are storing images and estimated points of something on their servers just not your hands otherwise there would not be a need for clarification case in point they state they do not store data gt but they might still store something seriously let me ask you this what would there need to be said that you would not go all conspiracist on this because right now you are moving the goal post at every point and going aha but you can not prove there is not something that they are hiding also let me remind you that such standard would have to be applied to everyone not just hypocritical i demand better from facebook than everyone else because if the facebook is only one who gets these stricter demands it shows that you are not actually concerned about these issues you are just using them as a smokescreen i want to buy a steam deck so badly but they are not available in my country i know man i am in the same boat with you i have been following it since the start and unable to do crap about it i will guess you and i will have to pay e bay scalpers to get it   i find these surveys odd whenever i complete it on steam it always says i have no vr headset because it is not connected at the time of gathering data the actual percentage of index is might be higher but similar to pc gaming mainstream vs high end a 300 400 dollar piece of kit is always going to be far far more popular than a 1000 dollar one the only issue is that index is not that high end compare to quest 2 if q2 is low end the difference is marginal but the price is not i would buy the index instead of q2 if the price difference was worth it but to me it just is not index seems overpriced because q2 is underpriced fair point i think facebook is going about it pretty cleverly same way console manufacturers used to sell their hardware for below cost just to get people into the ecosystem and it has worked extremely well for them their userbase is so much bigger now that we hear about games getting downgraded to be able to support standalone quest hardware i hope both pcvr and quest manage to get their userbase big enough that neither needs to suffer i hear you i showed my q2 to a couple of friends and when they heard about the price they got shocked and the first thing they did was to go out and buy one before black week hits in and stock may be gone i think oculus is huge for the vr community even for high end gamers if it means downgrading games at the moment getting everyone in on vr will make everything grow so much more and these people will be drawn towards higher end equipment with time much like i starting out with a shitty console and today i have a high end pc and i am starting out with a q2 and i know i will seek out higher end vrs with the time planting a seed will make it grow i would probably never get into the high end vr if it was not for the cheap q2 and i think a lot of people are in the same boat which i believe will make the high end section of vr industry explode it is possible though i do not think it is quite as obvious a consequence because if we compare it to pc console and high end pcs we can see a similar thing happening and how that goes on average people seeing a friend is gaming system e g ps4 or a mid range pc can absolutely go fuck yeah i want one of those and spend 300 500 to get that experience but if we look at how many people have consoles mid range pcs vs the high end we see not that many people would or have the means to jump up to the high end of things and when it comes to vr the jump up from standalone quest 2 to a high end headset and a high end pc to run high res in high enough fps that is literally multiple thousands of dollars as a pcvr enthusiast my fear is that the quest 2 will not be a rising tide for all ships but more of a hungry hungry hippo that slowly attracts more and more market share of course the increasing popularity of vr could cause more developers to create bigger experiences like we all want or the increasing popularity of the quest specifically could cause developers to all focus on the more lucrative platform and leave truly high end experiences in that are only possible on high end pcvr in the past the ability to do pcvr with it as well is nice too i think the pc parts shortage is as much if not a bigger problem than the limited headsets if you are one of the many people who want to upgrade their pc but can not right now the quest 2 is a nice compromise for getting into vr afaik steam tracks if your headset was connected within last month or so people always say it but it sounds really unlikely current estimates are like 3 million people on steam and there is little reason to think it is more than that to be expected honestly not everyone wants to dish out 1000dollar for vr if they are first timers the quest 2 is insane value albeit at the cost of facebook selling your data  what do you think selling your data means it means you get hit with ads so you buy more shit it also means that they are going to do everything they can to add more ads to everything they can even if you do not buy things from the ads your experience will suffer imdb tv is a free service with ads netflix no ads which experience is better  remeber cambridge analytica facebook has sold userdata in the past not just personalised advertisement they actively and directly sold the data according to some sources data that was not anonymised there is no reason to assume meta will not do the same in the future we do not even know if they ever stopped this is a privacy issue of course what makes the situation even worse is that a company like meta is getting more and more controll over the vr market a single company should not have this kind of controll and especially not a company with metas policies this shit needs to be regulated and we urgently need privacy respecting opensource operating systems for headsets especially for the enclosed oculus headsets cambridge analytics did not buy data from facebook they exploited the facebook api to get user info for free by getting people to install random apps i have not seen a single instance of facebook profiting from selling user data for the most part though facebook has positioned itself as the new cambridge analytica that is why they are less inclined to sell the data now as an aside cambridge analytica technically exploited a loophole in facebook is data access system they were not supposed to be able to get as much data as they did under facebook is terms of course that is pretty academic given that they did get the data but facebook got out of selling user data because they now instead do user modeling so if you want to say sell plane tickets for las vegas to bipolar users who are just entering a manic phase you pay facebook to target those users facebook is now a central clearinghouse for psychological manipulation for advertising it is also why they have been so effective at destroying us democracy so yeah selling data is an issue but what facebook is up to these days is maybe worse thanks very insightful i agree with most now gt it is why they have been so effective at destroying us democracy what democracy the usa are a two party state voters have the choice between neo liberals right and conservative fascists far right to even become canditate for presidency you have to be rich and need the support of various companies the voting system through representatives is indirect and if you want already undemocratic on it is own the administration of certain presidents is making harder for certain groups to vote it is the illusion of a democracy sorry for that rant fair enough there were remnants of democracy but you are right it was really more a plutocracy we are rapidly headed for a plutocrat funded autocracy though which is y know still worse gt remeber cambridge analytica you mean the case where data was stolen from facebook and then sold you mean the case where a research team exploited an api loophole to collect far more information than they were allowed and then refused to delete the data when facebook found out only to sell it to cambridge analytica you mean that case facebook has never sold data that is like saying that coca cola sells their recipe makes sense i have just seen similar arguments with the intent to disregard what is happening like well if they are not actually selling my data then this is all ok gt what do you think selling your data means probably that they sell your data aka companies buy it then get it you know like when you say this shop sells milk does not mean this shop lets other people use the milk without acquiring the milk gt what do you think selling your data means selling data selling data using data to target you with ads is not selling your data it is no different to how google uses your search history to target ads at you so they sell you the data is less of an issue i mean yes facebook meta has at trackrecord of mishandling user data without any moral concerns what so ever which definitely makes them worse in that area than most if not all other vr companies the real issue though is that meta is building it is monopoly on the standalone vr market preventing anyone from even becoming a competitor that meta is buying up vr game studios with the goal or at least capability of making everything meta exclusive in the future and meta trying and judging from how the rest is going so far probably succeeding to make the meta is verse and thereby the future of vr and societies their own thing right now not much bad will happen to you for using oculus devices you are just supporting meta ont heir way towards a dark dystopian future we need government regulations on that shit and less enclosed or even opensource operating systems for headsets as well as an actually publicly controlled metaverse nexus the problem is not the account attached it is the future attached people act like they are not helping their platform then go and demand youtubers talk about the quest that devs port to it and that people buy their headsets i just tried upgrading my cv1 to a reverb g2 and what i have found is the steam vr and wmr software just is not up to the level of oculus when it comes to stability and performance ie things like vector smoothing vs time warp etc if facebook put out a desktop level headset to replace the rift s with high res and fov i would have probably gotten it my cv1 has been fantastic for years selling your soul for a desire serving humanity since biblical times microsoft will never really compete until it is too late i have many family members over 70 loving the quest 2 they are not computer literate and they find using the quest easy they will never use a pc for vr thanks to valve for making steamvr an open platform unlike facbook meta oculus and their closed setup can you elaborate what is so open about steamvr it allows any headset to run through it and valve puts development effort into making various headset platforms compatible with steamsvr apis in comparison oculus has a bunch of exclusive games that can only be played through their store the quest is even more restricted not even making its games available to rift users through the oculus store which should be relatively trivial for them to do if they cared it is important to remember that a lot of the headsets being used on pc are not even being used on steam a lot of users play exclusively via oculus pcvr platform as far as just the steam ecosystem yeah pretty crazy gt a lot of users play exclusively via oculus pcvr platform i am calling bullshit if you are doing pcvr why would you limit your self to the oculus store i am willing to bet that less than 1percent of oculus pcvr users only buy from the oculus store consider that there is a fairly large number of occlus users who do not have a gaming pc at all what does that have to do with anything this is about pcvr not mobilevr anyone who is paying attention knows that by the holidays mobilevr will be 4 to 5 times as big as pcvr love how many people still use rift s like me but oculus barely support it anymore complete joke sometimes i miss my og rift it feels like a lot of things have gone backwards since then i still use mine resolution is obviously not good at this point but i still think it is one of the best headsets overall even all these years later yeah rift s is still the best headset i have ever used as a user with glasses affordable yet comfortable with decent resolution and panel quest 2 software is also shit do not worry about feeling left out they are only focusing on people who play standalone i stg none of my cables work properly probably because they want me to buy the official one cries with cv1 honestly though it is been a great headset but after seeing the fidelity of other headsets it leaves a lot to be desired great ergonomics black levels and controllers though my rift s cable finally died so i decided to get a quest 2 a benefits of the rift s is you simply put on the headset and you are in vr if the oculus app is running with quest link or air link it is not that fast the thing about the quest 2 link cable is if we choose to use it we are tethered to the pc just like with a rift s but unlike with a rift s we are free to ditch the cable if we go wireless or use native text games and apps rift s was more comfortable but quest 2 is more comfortable than quest 1 gt my rift s cable finally died so i decided to get a quest 2 a benefits of the rift s is you simply put on the headset and you are in vr if the oculus app is running with quest link or air link it is not that fast that is why i went from the rift s to the g2 my headset is always on and i can just plop it on my head whenever i may need to recalibrate my position sometimes but the takes two seconds do not worry quest 2 users will be just like that in a year just like quest 1 owners are left out now they aint gonna accept psvr 2 platform will look about 20 years more advanced in graphics game complexity most quest users do not use steam so the survey is not accurate for the full vr universe the numbers would be even more lopsided then if you counted everyone that uses vr pc standalone and ps the quest would still be the top dog by a much larger margin that is the point he is making yeah i agree with op given that oculus is arguably the only consumer priced headset should we be surprised no wonder vive is pure trash i need to find a buyer for my cosmos quick the headset would not be that bad but it does not support anything and oculus does anything better while costing less with 35 percent on quest 2 i doubt its a bad choice there should be user hacks if fakebook becomes too annoying i do not like it either but its the only affordable headset i prefer my kidneys staying in sli two work better than one also interesting to see a lot of people still use vive 1 the cosmos is a new world considering its resolution which is theoretically better than a index but the new headsets supersede that it is the cheapest choice thus the most popular  wireless alone is a pro point but overall they also do everything better if you ever owned a htc product you know what i mean htc even offers upgrade options for the cosmos but the wireless is shitty and extremly expensive they literally charge 200 euros for the faceplate a piece of plastic and then expect you to get basestations and new controllers because the cosmos ones do not work with base stations oculus delivers all of that out of the box a decent resolution wireless and a topping also a powerful smartphone processor that is included in the package and makes the headset work standalone the quest 2 also has the ability to hook up to a pc with a usb c cable the hybrid nature pcvr stand alone and the low price is what made me buy one dollar300 and other than some annoying problems on the pcvr side of things i love this headset quest 2 is a fuller package in ways but let is not ignore the shortcuts taken on headset comfort build quality along with accessories breaking i guess it needs some upgrades but i rather get a cheap headset which i can upgrade than getting an expensive one where i still need to upgrade gt shortcuts taken on headset comfort build quality to me that is a benefit not a drawback the barrier for entry needs to be as low as possible and the industry actually benefits from that also you can upgrade i do not have all the money to spend at once wmr headsets used to be the cheapest starting from dollar99 but they never gained more than 12percent market share on steam that is because they had a garbage service compared to quest and was wired and investment and marketing was not made in it the vr gaming experience itself was very comparable but everything else was not going for it if there was any real competition this could look differently i hope to be joining pcvr for the first time soon excited for you lesgo 5percent cv1 gang this is really sad also rather inaccurate the steam survey does not recognize pimax at all for instance i am not saying it falls under other i am saying it refused to acknowledge the existence of my 5k and 8k x headsets either way i would not suspect pimax significan notly altering the stats here fuck facebook though meta tbh i am gonna keep calling them facebook not out of spite but because it does not hide the history of the name untill there is more stuff not related under the facebook brand it is still all facebook it is honestly just the price and lack of needing sensor boxes i imagine i hardly use the actual desktop oculus if ever and i only have two games on the actual headset you forgot it is wireless that is a huge benefit of using a quest yep anyone who comes out with a wireless to desktop like i use this with better screen for even dollar100 more and i will do it if it is good i bought my samsung odyssey in 2020 and still have absolutely no reason to switch to a different headset i do however enjoy when my friends bring over an oculus quest 2 and we can enjoy a vr experience together ngl the valve index makes up a lot more than expected especially since the vive has been around for so long can not get an index in my country and htc is ludicrously expensive no wonder oculus is ahead also the fact that you can use the quest 2 in both pcvr with a usb c cable or stand alone mode for as low as dollar300 i knew they would be ahead when i heard that price tag gt also the fact that you can use the quest 2 in both pcvr with a usb c cable you do not need a cable if you have a half way decent router for well no shit the quest 2 is 300 usd and pretty good and the next competitor costs 3 4 times as much and is not remotely 3 4 times better i can talk my buddies into spending 300 usd to join me in vr but 1000 that is a god damn hard sale let me tell you this is why i keep saying that valve needed to make a cheap o inside out versions of the index by all means make the deckard but make a affordable headset too otherwise this kind of thing happens all my friends except one took one look at facebook and balked at the idea then they looked at the prices of alternatives and balked again still do not understand why oculus dropped support for the second largest headset on pc because quest 2 does everything rift does and it simplifies their support structure instead of trying to figure solutions for two headsets that operate differently they can just focus on one because oculus quest 2 in just a few months on the market has outsold not just lenovo rift s but all of its predecessors combined cos other companies are retarded as fuck giving facecrap free monopoly and cry afterwards about how they can not catch up anymore fuck all other companies do not care anymore and it is to late true story where the hell is psvr was not like the best seller for several months before oculus became popular psvr users are like 2percent of steamvr users and i do not know how they are that high considering there is not support this is a steamvr chart not a vr market chart ohhh my bad then people play on steam with psvr headsets damn reverb g2 ai not even on the board i wonder how big a part of other they make up is there any actual technical reason to get any of the oculus headsets though especially when it comes to controllers and tracking fidelity it just seems to me that those models pander to very casual uses that pale in comparison to the more precise input and output gear inside out tracking of controllers is better than on wmr or cosmos touch controllers for me are the most ergonomic the fov is narrower than pretty much everything else but not by a wide margin aside from pimax wireless pcvr on standalones is pretty good i also like the sharpness and wide sweetspot so there are reasons aside from cost and care for ux failing with rift s quite a bit with that but they do have their cons the inexplicable push for not great audio solution requirement of facebook account etc so some things are really good but they do target lower budget but do not be fooled by the price others have some margins to make profit off the hardware while margins on quest hardware is near 0 so comparing dollar to dollar of value is not entirely accurate metric personally i own quite few oculus hmds but played around with index vive i also have reverb g2 and i find myself gravitating towards q2 even for pcvr and g2 gets relegated mostly too space flight racing sims for me with index bright artefacts were a bit distracting but my brain mainly ignored them after a while the sharpness was hard to dial in so it would be sharp across the fov but the fov was noticeably bigger nothing major as my brain tends to ignore narrower fov after a while i really like eye relief adjustment and audio on index and audio on reverb but i liked rift cv1 audio solution as well the biggest disappointment when it comes to index were resolution and controllers i probably got overhyped waiting for them and i love that it has a strap and ton of inputs that even when not entirely functional within games are immersion multipliers but they were never comfortable for me while touch melts into my hand especially cv1 when i played wired on cv1 headset cable never really bothered me all that much yes it tangled and rested on my back etc but when i play now with quest i readily trade visual fidelity for wireless pcvr wireless pcvr without specialised hardware is pretty good primarily value for the dollar nothing comes close to the quest when it comes to what you get for the price oculus insight tracking is every bit as accurate as the htc vive tracking you just can not keep your hands out of the fov of the cameras for more than a couple seconds at a time for most people that does not matter but depending on what you want to do in vr it could be make the quest or any thing head set camera tracked controllers a no go that is why i said technical and not financial reasons like i am all for getting value for money but i am also way more concerned about quality of the product you get it is no use saving money if you get a substantially lesser quality of experience for it like i doubt anything that does the inside out tracking is ever going to support full body tracking or even just being able to reach behind your own head good fidelity is important for immersion even if you are just playing games where your hands are in view all the time no wmr my samsung odyssey still going strong wish devs would not break compatibility with it tho yep turns out cost and availability are winners and yet even bringing it up on this sub in a vaguely positive light makes people react like you just told someone to get the plague yeah truly a sad momentary state for vr if you want to feel really sad just realize most oculus quest users do not connect to pc or even have no vr ready pc which is exactly why they went with a quest idk i bought a quest 2 to use it with airlink and steamvr but yea i would be curious to see how many will stick to the evil guy ecosystem i just can not afford a high end pc nor can i afford to update it down the road i get that point what i do not like is the whole invasive and exclusive development ecosystem from facebook and their general villain approach on user data privacy and bias exploiting social engineering i do not either but there is not exactly other optio s for low i come gamers who want to try vr if valve and htc and these other companies make something then i will buy it  hey thanks for reposting my pie chart super cool i will have more charts coming soon i hate this as affordable as the oculus devices are fb should not be the ones leading this market wish it was never sold to them it is only a matter of time before they ruin it with their whole ametaverse bullshit i predict they will fail with the metaverse terrifying can not believe there are people willing to defend facebook really says a lot about consumers bring a product to the market that people desire and can afford and bam suddenly they are not so bad anymore well of course they do they are easily the most cost effective options sad to say most people can not afford to spend double or more than double just for the sake of their morals it is not about morals it is about us all being fucked soon still using my rift still using my rift cv1 yes it is going to be a monopoly regardless they are still not the best hmd on the market i feel ashamed for downgrading to this perfectly capable extension of zuck myself i do not mind the quest i am mostly pcvr but i do own a quest but i really dislike a lot of the quest community when it comes down to it a lot of the people using quests are children and as such a lot of them are toxic when you go into a multiplayer vr game that is just pcvr you do not really get that toxicity classic sell product for loss for market share scheme going on here wtf general mills does not have a headset  they are the best what do you expect when meta disables steamvr compatibility index will become the most widely used vr headset on steam why would they do that the quest originally did not support it fb added support later i would say that it would be more likely a future headset does not support it because they would piss off current quest 2 owners lol delusional they will not that would make people look for another headset to play alyx this is the easiest way to kill off steamvr 25percent of all headsets were completely abandoned by those fucks at oculus facebook that is sad meta lol  if you ever felt like trying a vive you could get one at a decent price it can also be an upgrade path to an index i know it is not recommended by most understandably but it is an option that exists happy to see the quest 2 do so well still using my trusty rift s though this is only because nobody else is really competing samsung lenovo acer dell asus who else all of these companies got out once they determined that it is not worth it there is no money in it they are better off making laptops or monitors basically anything other than niche vr headsets this is before the quest even came along so it is not like they were forced out they just looked at the numbers and realised that there is no money in it so with facebook having 60percent of the market i am not sure if winning the race to the bottom is necessarily something to be proud of gt so with facebook having 60percent of the market i am not sure if winning the race to the bottom is necessarily something to be proud of so they should not be proud of the q2 a device that gives you 6dof mobilevr or streamed pcvr for dollar299 and has sold 4x as many units and brought 4x as many people to vr than all of pcvr combined did in 6 years i think i would be pretty proud of that well i am pretty sure they are losing money on vr losing money is not that hard so anyone willing to lose money could probably do the same thing reality labs is funded by meta for a lot of different stuff besides their vr hardware that pays for most of the r amp d and it is likley that the 30percent they make off the store easily coverys everyting else for just the production costs i think tthe 128gb version is sold at a small lost and that they make a pretty good margin on the 256gb version they certainly make a good margin on their 1st party accessories great visual that tells you all the key info if this was on a tech blog it would have been surrounded by paragraphs of buildup and redundant text  yes it is accurate if you are paranoid about the oculus device being listed first it seems to be in order of price we do not have a price for santa cruz yet but people are guessing around dollar500 so i hear but i do not know how you could express bias with blunt specifications short of straight up lying about what they were too many storefronts i wish companies would stop doing this they are all trying to be the new apple app store the stores will consolidate once the buyers focus on one or two i just really really hope they do not become the app store and start selling super cheap titles en masse till the market becomes flooded and entirely unusable it needs to be more like steam steam is a monopoly when it comes to non vr we do not want a monopoly in standalone vr thank goodness oculus is on pc and has competed equally with steam the best thing for consumers and competition would be for 2 stores to dominate enough for competition but not too many that it is hard to switch if steam is trying to be a monopoly they are doing a really bad job at it oculus on the other hand is focusing on trying to create a monopoly with anti consumer tactics but they are worse at that than steam is at trying to be a monopoly steam is literally a monopoly when it comes to non vr pc gaming by the definition of almost all regulators you have no clue what a monopolistic action is nor what a monopoly is can you only by computer games from steam i would love to hear your definition of a monopoly as it is not the same as everyone else on the planet every regulator in europe defines a monopoly as when only 1 company has over 25percent of a particular market steam is the only pc non vr gaming store with more than 25percent market share i am sure america is definition is similar facepalm that is not the definition of a monopoly please show me where you get your information from pulling it out of your ass does not count yes it literally is facepalm go learn basic economics before injecting your opinion into these discussions you seem to not know the difference between a monopoly and a pure monopoly so by your definition oculus too is a monopoly they own 85percent of mobile and 50percent of pc vr they are a monopoly in the mobile market right now but not in pc because monopoly legally requires you to be the only company with gt 25percent htc also has around 47percent of the pc market so no it is defined as a duopoly right now oculus is trying to create a console like ecosystem on the pc space so i do not share your thank goodness oculus is on pc if oculus just created a storefront that was open to all i would agree with you but until then i think oculus is poisoning the pc space and vr well even in the standalone vr market oculus is bringing up the rear of resolution like netflix and hulu i just get both so if something is not on one it is usually on the other would be a lot nicer if both stores offered the same content so you could choose the overall better store instead of just the content on it with the way oculus is doing business you would need entirely separate hardware to support your netflix hulu subscription good point it is pretty annoying how shows and movies are exclusive to only one app like when something is on amazon prime or hbo i am not going to sign up for a new service just to watch one show exclusives are such a shitty way of doing business that is the way all the above oems except pico are doing business so i can buy anything off the oculus store and use it with any vr headset learn to read what i type what you buy on viveport can only be used on vive focus and pico neo what you buy on pico store can only be used on goblin and neo what you buy on daydream can only be used on daydream view and mirage solo what you buy on oculus can only be used on gear vr go and santa cruz what is the difference learn the market you are talking about before injecting your opinion you forgot steam why focus on the companies with anti consumer actions exactly or android and iphone google home and amazon alexa waymo and cruise playstation and xbox innovate hard to compete with eachother not fully though if we had all in one it would be great but it will most likely end up like it did with online drm we will have steam and them some smaller ones which are mainly just for one publisher like origin or uplay only if they are clearly above competition be it drm less policy or separate customer friendly pricing in dollar and euros hehe it kinda reminds me of gog galaxy they do not happen to have their own storefront do they s nobody wants to be the first to start using someone else is it will sort itself out when enough consumers enter the field and basically choose for the companies this is how all new markets start the big money is all in the storefronts not in the hardware itself every oem with the ability to do so will try to get their own platform out there over time consumer preferences will bring it down to 2 winners like the mobile market with ios and android or ai market with google assistant and alexa and the other oems will make hardware for those platforms if i had to guess i would say it will be oculus and daydream with htc and pico changing to the latter in around 3 years i just wish it was not the case it is just bad for the consumers to be locked into a certain ecosystem that is the main reason i moved away from consoles to pc personally i do not really have much interest in standalone vr but i was thinking of getting one just for porn but now with all these storefronts it is just put me right off it will not be the case in 5 years the same thing happened in the mobile market there was ios android windows phone blackberry symbian and some others in the end it is just ios and android porn runs on webvr mostly which is cross platform webvr may be the saviour in this perspective actually i hope you are right it is just a shame it will take that long so what are the odds we see steam better support the rift and the oculus store supporting the vive in the future i am not talking about pc i am talking about mobile amp standalone by the time oculus store supports non oculus systems htc probably will not exist in the market oculus is likely to go first facebook has to be getting fed up with all the fumbles and they keep shedding people cv1 going to be the first and last of the consumer pc line you are delusional oculus is growing every year it has over 1500 people working for it now oculus owns gt 50percent of the pc market and gt 85percent of the mobile market that dollar199 will probably jump out at many average consumers the following is a vr statistic that showed what happened in 2016 greenlight vr survey reveals u s consumers are most interested in using virtual reality for travel entertainment events home design and education in fact the title of the article is vr survey more interest in travel videos than gaming if 2017 2018 stats are similar and facebook knows these stats they might release products accordingly they may assume that most of the people they are interested in facebook users may spend more time performing non gaming activities such as watching videos and interacting socially in vr as avatars there is an article called why is oculus releasing so many different types of headsets if everybody was a gamer maybe the oculus go might now exist gamers and companies with business use cases and me will probably prefer real vr which today costs more than dollar199 here is a 2017 stat compiled by the greenlight research firm two thirds of u s consumers are interested in social vr excerpt virtual reality has always been more than a medium for gaming experiences and technology savvy consumers are quickly learning that erica bishaf research director for greenlight insights our findings from multiple studies suggest that some platforms in the vr ecosystem may be overly focused on gaming the reality is that consumers have a wide variety of interests for using virtual reality including creative expression platform and content providers would be wise to consider these bigger richer findings as they develop their content and marketing strategies so if facebook is shooting for social vr and microsoft by its own admission is shooting for social vr maybe a dollar199 oculus go or a dollar230 acer running on a low powered non ultra laptop may satisfy a lot of the world is consumers they go users may never get to try positional tracking but for many of them that may not matter if stats about usage trends are correct they will not need positional tracking to watch a vr video while riding on a plane or meet a friend in a vr theater to watch a movie they will not even need a phone if they get one of those all in one headsets dollar199 and you are in the club someone is grandmother may not care too much about fallout 4 but she might like to meet her grand daughter in a facebook room and hang out as an avatar the lenovo one so far looks like the best bang for your buck with both positional tracking and accessible pricing that is unless santa cruz stays in the same price range but also adds positional tracking on the controllers as well although i feel more like it will hover around the price range of the vive focus in which case it will be a choice between higher visual fidelity or positional tracking of the controllers there are other factors to consider imo which advantages does a 6dof headset with 3dof controllers have compared to both 3dof in real life and which will have the most compelling content the oculus store should be well above daydream right now the lenovo is price hardware wise definitely attractive though effectively you pay double for 6dof tracking compared to the go from my personal experience i find 3dof visuals to be extremely jarring so i would not want anything with 3dof on the screen even for half the price even on a simple theater app where you effectively watch a 2d screen in front of you that gjves you the effect of being 30ft tall having said screen follow my back amp forth head movement all the time instead of sticking to it is spatial position makes me feel very uncomfortable but that might just be my personal problem as for the controller being 3dof only it does not feel as bad as you will most likely only use it as a pointer or as a regular gamepad in those use cases however for sure if that was also 6dof it would open up an entire new world of possible application good luck to all they are going to sell 10 units what makes you think that too many players for a niche market standalone will only be successful with an ar implementation gearsvr had a limited success and that was free i do not see how they expect people to pay dollar300 to play mobile phone games gear vr was dollar99 and has had huge success the most reviewed vr only games on oculus pc and steam have around 5k reviews the highest rated gear vr apps have 50k 60k 70k reviews 10x the active userbase of pc vr standalone will dwarf the pc market pc is the niche this is a sad truth it is very disappointing as everyone i have talked to about vr that does not own a rift or vive has been very turned off by mobile and stand alone vr honestly without full positional tracking for the headset and controllers what is the point gt dollar99 sorry i have it for free like almost everybody i know and yes keep dreaming every five years or so comes some genius declaring the death of the pc go look at the amazon sales figures it outsells all the others there i did not say pc was dead i just said it will remain niche for vr can you provide a source for that and we know that the rift is a good chunk above the vive eenie meenie miney mo santa cruz is stand alone i thought its connected to pc has never been that way nope fully standalone does not connect to a pc here are my musts for a standalone system headset positional tracking controller positional tracking and steamvr vr will go mainstream once you get the full package in a standalone system that can play some cool games on its own i just hope we are not ahead of our time steamvr is pc only it does not run on standalone oss or socs of the mobile standalone platforms right now oculus has the highest quality and quantity of content so replace steamvr in your list with oculus and you have it oculus is only interested in creating a walled off ecosystem i would not buy from them just for that reason then you have to consider the data it wants to mine of you  the google one is the lenovo one unless you mean something unknown  3dof or 6dof what why would not they announce that they were pretty open about the all in one headsets they wanted to bring to market although the deal with htc did not work out and all of them will fade into obscurity damaging vr in general due to their unique programming requirements and store fronts software drives adoption and being open and abstracted is the answer all of these standalone devices could have added a pc interface and openvr and then would have universal value so i guess nintendo needs to come out with one just imagine if all the headsets currently out did not need distortion correction or handled it in the hardware and accepted any hdmi input literally all of the distortion correction could be done by a signal processor inside the headset all a game engine has to do is output two stereo images via openvr writing a driver for openvr is child is play so much so that four separate developers are adding in unsupported headsets as we speak that have all the capabilities of the vive and that includes things like a gear vr from your mobile phone there is no excuse except greed but the funny part is they will actually lose money this way psvr since it has an hdmi port can be used as a vive windows mr headsets have seen tremendous success even though there is so many options and i would go on record to say that is entirely due to steamvr and by proxy that also means oculus home via librevr cross compatibility the funny thing is windows mr is a walled garden too but it is got some great stuff i would not have even cared to check it out if it did not have support for openvr though microsoft was very smart to add that to their platform and these other hardware developers need to follow their lead u can also add integrated audio and the integrated storage amount and sd card option if you are looking for one of these the lenovo seems like a good bet great upgrade to push to clients over basic mobile vr for sure once you add in the cost of a phone then gearvr is not terribly cheap anyway almost everyone who buys a gear vr already has the phone though  because it is only releasing that headset in china hi mate did you do this lineup with the wired ones also thx yes but since they are all so similar it required a more detailed perspective as tables rather than a chart edit nice to see the officially playspace for the rift changed someone has changed the officially playspace for the rift from 8 2ftx8 2ft to 3mx3m which is 9 8ft which is not the correct officially playspace for the rift so i have just changed it to 2 5mx2 5 which is 8 2ft here is a which does state 8ft is recommeded if you do not want to read all that here is the i know the 2ft is extra but i thought i would just round it up just for you haha does anyone like their daydream thinking of buying one had a vive before daydream view is very different from mirage solo mirage solo has positional tracking whereas daydream view does not comfy headset scan not content it is a solid 6 10  none of the windows mr headsets except the samsung one have variable ipd nor does psvr are they failures too yes your asking for market failure if your device causes eye strain ok well psvr has outsold all other 6dof headsets combined by like 2x so no you are wrong and vrgear out sold those and google cardboard has outsold both of those attach rate and play time is where the important numbers are for long term success and only one has an oled screen which makes a huge difference in vr i personally will never use any of these products but recognise the market potential so once there are blockchains designed for these services i will gladly contribute to their uptake and profit as a result why are they doing this energy limits and heat dissipation necessarily gimp any such tiny computer just as they do in mobile phones and other small platforms and it is so much worse for something as demanding as vr they will thermal throttle within tens of minutes i consider each and every one of these to be 1 of 2 things a scam or a porn video headset you know all those times you see gearvr being used for small experiences and marketing materials where lugging a pc around is not viable yeah this would be a massive step up and probably cheaper all those times i see gear vr used for marketing material honestly only once at a big data conference and i skipped it i see the potential for these stand alone devices in 3 4 years and as much as i hate saying it apple will be the one to pull it off for ones not tied to desktop gpus those will strive bc of gaming so none of these devices excites me yet do not get me wrong i would love to be proven wrong about the apple part but i am pretty confident in the 3 4 years part mostly bc i used daydream with my note 8 and i returned it after 45 mins and i was super excited for it i mostly wanted it for casual use to like watching a movie on a plane and it just was not a great experience i think it will get there just not with the next round of mobile chips and tech gt why are they doing this because the vast vast majority of people do not own a gaming pc and do not want to pay dollar800 on top of a pc vr system just to use vr i strongly disagree most people who try mobile vr never want to go near it again and most people who have tried pc vr do not count mobile solutions as vr it is honestly an insult to the term virtual reality gt most people who try mobile vr never want to go near it again this is just nonsense go and read the top helpful amazon and best buy reviews for the current gear vr you will be shocked at how wrong you are i see a lot of 5s and a lot of 1s that tells me all i need to know or it would if gearvr were a single thing instead of a lot of different things depending on which smart phone you use again go back and read the top helpful reviews i see averages of higher than 4 5 and overall excellent reviews if you have to bias filter the reviews to show what you want it is kind of pointless but then again so is this whole comment thread now that i have noticed who i am replying to you are the baghdad bob of vr again i am not touching the filter i am just scrolling down to the reviews and actually reading them then read the 1 star reviews as well you are extremely biased i have spoken to well over 70 people about it in person every single one has been disappointed and put off of vr from mobile vr maybe some people like it but as a vr game developer i have yet to meet one in person this guy will be here for us after ww3 so next thursday then rip ukraine happy cake day you are the second person i have seen today with the same cake day happy cake day thanks you will wish him a happy cake day too happy cake day hey i saw a couple of negative comments and i just wanna say good job on taking some steps on making something it takes a lot of courage to try something new and unique and i am sure lots of folks are proud of you i think a lot were made in good jest scrolling through their post history they like to tinker properly honed and harnessed could lead to a career or just amazing pieces of work and big projects start very modest like a cut up plastic fish bowl it is about iteration oh man iteration is key near the beginning of mandated mask our company sourced out homemade masks but the straps were not adjustable or elastic so they would fold our ears in and they got real sore real quick i had already seen a few behind the head strap holders out there so i decided to model my own just for kicks it was a rectangle shaped bar with three pairs of hooks placed on each side for adjustability the first iteration was too thick so it could not flex wildly uncomfortable so i thinned it then i added curves to more comfortably rest against the back of the skull but it still was not good enough it was meant to be used with hardhats but it sort of got in the way of the tightener knob on the back and was annoying to put on then i realized i could split the two sides and make them clips that attached directly to the hardhat liner i had people providing feedback through the whole process as i was testing i swear i have never looked at so many dudes ears up close in my life big ears small ears further back closer to the eyes higher lower i ended up dropping the two sets of hooks on each side only keeping one set per clip i adjusted the angle and made it wider to help mitigate wear on the top if the ear and turned them into five sizes and sold them for dollar5 a pair i made enough for a couple rolls of filament and learned a ton in the process it was a great experience this is great advice that more people need to hear iteration is the means and methods of innovation that was a fun read fascinating stuff they are just joking i doubt anybody is seriously hating on a dude for creating his own headset indeed the world needs more people like you creation is one of my biggest sources of joy and happiness i recommend everyone to go out there and try to create something especially when you are feeling kinda down nicest redditor i once made a gas mask out of an asthma inhaler a medical face mask and a plastic sandwich bag did not work but had a lot of fun making it lol looks like it has face and eye tracking built in tracking and a holographic display truly the future looks like two lcds meant to reflect off safety glasses how is well does it work yeah but not how it was meant how did you do it probably better bang for my buck with this compared to the quest pro does it work or my guess is no wrong it is working but i still need to make an os for this i propose calling it vos is dos a play on the german was ist das meaning what is this and virtual os and the og ms dos platform congrats are you planning to core with something existant or go from scratch are you going to make a video about how you made it and how it works because this is actually pretty cool what you try making one please the people sitting here saying this is stupid have never done anything other than watch youtube and reddit for the next thing they tell you to buy i used to use meth too adderall was my immediate thought may be a generational thing wikipedia does have an interesting article on adderall will give it a skim today with enough caffeine i could recreate around 50percent of what op made with this i 100percent agree this was also my first thought i still do but i used to too yooo it is the quest quest 1 2 how good is the display projection for a second i thought he still needed lenses but i just figured out that the displays are projected on the goggles it is not quite good but still interesting result looks like reality goggles jokes aside looks really cool and i love the idea of having a hud i think you are on to something here keep it up google cardboard pro did you use a plumbus with it or no was that a rick and morty reference i sensed perhaps definitely also i have no idea why i was downvoted say i know this is a bit off topic but did you ever see the episode where they show how plmbus are made idk either and yeah why just curious mostly cause you know what a plumbus is but yeah reddit is weird like that what wow you are super talented dude i wish i had someone to do these interesting projects with good luck with the development keep us updated well surely it is better than htc is next headset yep already got higher specs and we do not even know it yeah this is thc is next headset cool project looks like two composite maybe displays pointing at a semi clear pair of work glasses so this could sort of work you need to reverse the image before sending it to the display which is easily done in software i am guessing these are lower than 320x240 resolution which is pretty abysmal but it is okay if all you are doing is emulating the age of computers game from before hd tvs were a thing i am curious to know more i was at quakecon 2012 or maybe it was 2013 when they were giving super secret rift demos it was literally a ski mask with a smartphone screen strapped on this might actually be more sophisticated this is how it starts well done ah i think i remember that it was the prototype before the um refinement that is awesome you got to see the early rift prototype this reminded me of that as well still crazy to think some kid in a forum just up and decided to make vr and here we are today shame the story of oculus and palmer ended the way it did with him being forgotten and kind of a douche oculus was the most exciting company in tech for a long time we have so few stories now of solo people at their house out designing huge tech companies lol does it work or is this just a built this while trippin and have no idea what it does nor do i want to moment i want to know that but i feel i already know the answer i can not tell if this is a shit post or not a shit post or a shit post  or was it a shit post for a shit post balance looks nice reminds me of old school fpv goggles pilots before my time in fpv use to make their goggles out of old ski goggles and fly with those they actually made their own headsets that is pretty neat i would not call fpv goggles headsets per say but yeah lol they are mostly just 5 8ghz radio receivers with a screen they pickup low latency video transmissions from the drone and pump them into your eyes as quick as possible oh yeah i think i remember seeing it with a high end dji drone it is similar to what you are describing interestingly enough the dji goggles can be used for home built drones just as well as old school analog ones in fact because they transmit a digital signal the picture quality and framerate are much better i have a homemade race drone that is bound to those dji goggles i also have the dji drone which really is not that impressive it flies like it is drunk i just pictured a dji drone getting drunk then flying although that is pretty cool that works with non dji drones pretty much what its like and it kinda does you have gotta add dji is little box and camera but it integrates with betaflight flight controllers just fine what is beta flight betaflight is the firmware installed on the computers that are in our race quads probably better than everything facebook has done after the og rift meet the engineer have you named this device yet i suggest ghetto goggles cardboard is already taken sadly hobox edit wait no sniffing that glue will produce some unreal visuals but can it play crysis doom are those monochrome oled displays with 128x64 resolution i guess so should be good enough for scrolling text sell it to meta for 1 billion as plamer luckey did anyone who hates on this does not understand the power of being able to fix something yourself this is amazing teach me how pls next step get a 3d printer cad up some designs create an open source github project and get yourself a community continue to develop this project with the community or all by yourself launch a patreon maybe when you have a fully functional reliable prototye you are proud of reach out to the mysticle on youtube and ask him to cover your project your community will grow in no time and i have no doubt that the vr community will support you on this project we need more unique projects like this aiming at consumers keep it up man it is awesome this is an interesting idea wether serious or not so this is where meta got there head strap from halloween costume attire more than likely is this a meme i know of prototyping but this looks like someone extracted the dna of the quest sharted on it and then sent the new dna to a molecular printer not a single can it run bonelab i am proud of you reddit it will be more immersive when the glue is heating up it lacks snorkel love the light blocking around the clear lenses i mean if you actually want to make a vr headset you should probably consider getting a 3d printer to make a durable plastic shell for the headset since i do not think cardboard would really cut it the anycubic kobra is a good printer to start it is dollar259 which is quite cheap for a 3d printer this if real is likely still in prototyping phases usually physicallity comes after the prototyping has finished and a design is set cardboard is cheap quick and reusable so it works well when prototyping a design there is no way that works nice screen for 2005 i have one of those still mine is the samsung 710t that can turn vertical very well made some administrative computers still use them today lol why fun ima be real i wouldnt use that do you know what the oculus hmd looked like at its conception if this is a serious creation it is likely in its infancy and we are getting to see it before it truly has form i do not think this is a serious thing what an artist r electroboom meta adventure pro quest pro minimalist edition at amp t exclusive imagine how cool this headset feels compared to all the rest jealous cartman 100percent pass through if you are this intuitive you should buy a 3d printer could really make a quality headset then this is really cool what did you use to make it and what was the total cost i could see places where even if this is low res it might be useful literally anywhere you need some basic text instruction while you are looking elsewhere and have your hands occupied musicians and cooking come to mind lord knows it is a pain when my phone locks i have food on my hands but also need to see the next ingredient me dawns his cooking goggles did not google already try that something called glass i believe there was a special name for people wearing them as well they did try glass but it was not this per say it was a single non stereo 3d display they tried to stuff a whole smartphone into it basically added a bunch of features no one asked for and cameras that were pretty invasive charged an ungodly amount of money for it and then half assed it until they killed it as google products go similar but clearly not the same for several reasons gt added a bunch of features no one asked for that was kind of the point they were trying to figure out how people would actually use it gt cameras that were pretty invasive how so the device was not meant for streaming continuous recording 30 minutes of continuous camera operation would kill the battery if it did not overheat first it is a lot easier to secretly record someone by pretending to mess around on your phone than it is by staring directly at them with a weird thing on your face you can get a hidden camera pen to stick in your shirt pocket for dollar30 on amazon and it will record much longer gt and then half assed it until they killed it as google products go you are talking out your ass they have released two hardware revisions since they killed it you can buy a new one right now with next day shipping they have found their niche with enterprise customers and do not bother marketing to consumers that do not understand it apply to meta r amp d department now needs more duct tape that is so cool do you think you could grab some shots from the inside pov style pancake lenses wow looks really cool must have been hard to do respect beavis and butthead did something similar holy shit if you wanted you could make the design open source like the lucas vr gloves that way people can make their own headset and gloves what sort of stuff does it run on raspberry pi or is it a pc only headset for now it is just a cube demo but i think on making some code for it and making it a fully compatible with pc would love to hear more about what is inside i know people are just having fun but i am impressed i love the high tech cardboard padding nice what is the computer system powering it i would say a raspberry pi or a arduino would be good for a system like this but i would love to see what you have used i just grabbed one of my arduinos and two lied screens and this is only a prototype looks like a proper proto this looks badass honestly does it work with steamvr or your own software or is it standalone sick and impressive to boot oh yes i thought the days of experimental hmds were gone get at it dude is there a discord or youtube channel i can go to to see progress updates ummm i would like to know if it works if so can it run blade and sorcery with mods may i suggest you invest in a 3d printer man this looks amazing so far keep it up actually i am kinda surprised how slim you managed to make it all you are missing is some build in headphones in the side like those ones that slide onto your ear how is tracking woah fffing impressive hopefully i will get to your talent level is someday keep making awesomeness cheers sick could you post a photo or two of how it looks in first person even just the blank displays reflecting off the screen would be pretty cool this is like r tomorrow but for vr awesome work keep going i want to start on ar and create my own headset for a project can you please help me on some resources and where to start whats the latency like for virtual desktop pcvr i might have to get one of these if its good why is everyone hating on this it is the coolest thing i have seen all day i was thinking about doing the same thing but had no idea where to start i was not planning on using any cardboard though very cool i would love to hear some details butters is that you looks like a bd wreath bro you need a 3d printer is that the new pico open source it and let is beat meta this is a really great amount of effort kudos i hope the os dev and further prototypes go well the industry really needs more underdog competitors as its current state basically leaves it in a position of buy big box or go broke can it run bonelab tho does it work man you got to get yourself a 3d printer such a great tool for stuff like this prob still better graphics than the quest the famous eye suicide my eyes are bleeding but good work you could really use a 3d printer vr at home very impressive does it work well now it is just a spinning cube but i am working on fully working os good luck op why are the wires excessively long because i do not have the small ones this is great news people are wishing the thing at the point they are making prototypes does it work yes but in demo mode that is interesting no hate to the guy but idk if this actually works for the displays to properly reflect into the eye the glasses would need to have a reflective lattice on them to redirect the light by 135 degrees otherwise the displays will reflect at 90 degrees which would direct the into the top of the headset not the eyes of course reflective lattice is not easy to etch into a pair of plastic glasses and i can not see it in the photo so i will assume it is not there if op can enlighten me on how he directs the reflection from the displays into his pair of blinkers i am all ears the thing is actually working for now it is just a spinning cube but the screens are not perfect but it does not reflect to the top of the headset but i need to position it more accurately giving me edgerunner vibes when he shows up to class and busts their system what can you even do with it nice work you could probably make a project north star optical combiner work with this it has a proper elliptical profile and optical coatings i think you can still get them from smart prototypingdotcom for dollar40 or so neat does it use an rpi if you use the quest 3 with virtual desktop you do not need the oculus software you can also use steam link which allows your quest to connect straight to steamvr without the oculus software oh really thats a game changer for me i thought this was not possible thank you pico is the chinese government ofc i know that is why i would put in an isolated network without internet access meta is the american government that is not better and in a year when that orangutan is back i used pico 4 and now quest 3 for gaming you can just install virtual desktop and you are set no extra apps nor internet access for both pico 4 and quest 3 but if you wanna stream the headset pov even before entering the game or os menus useful when guiding people trying the headset on pico 4 this is possible offline but not quest 3 since that one require internet access for some reason the main thing that i miss about the pico 4 is how easy it is to cast to any device in my local network directly without apps thanks a lot for your response would you prefer the quest3 over the pico 4 generally pico 4 is a great value but if money is no issue and you will get a battery strap for quest 3 then yes i prefer quest 3 in many aspects there is improvement gt gt gt except for the pet peeve of casting easily offline mentioned above the idea is to stick a screen on a stripped down phone vr headset put a raspberry pi with dual camera and 6dof sensor on it and have the crappiest yet affordable way of doing experimenting with mixed reality i admire your effort have you heard about leap motion project north star i did not know of that yet the pictures look very trippy i am gonna have to look into this d i am glad they are still around i pre ordered the original bank in 2013 and i was not sure they would stick around ok wow that link says a lot about your relation to privacy yeah whatcha gonna do now that you know i have a huawei phone he can feel cool and write the comment i can see that you use one of the most privacy disrespectful browsers one of the most privacy disrespectful search engines and all that on a phone from a companie that got banned in the usa for allegedly spying on it is users the fact that you involuntarily shared all this information just adds too perfectly to the image for me not to point it out this is what i meant i hope you can see where i am comming from seriously if your privacy and the privacy of your fellow human beings means anything to you please switch there are countless browsers and search engines that provide a lot of comfort while protecting you data under this capitalist system we unfortunately vote with our money by using google you are actively supporting their privacy policies and helping to eliminate privacy just because you have an index does not mean that your are better then anyone else protect your privacy if everything else is to much effort for you at least install a safe browser and use a good search engine i think privacy is importan and we should defend and reclaim it as a result of this i chose an index i know not everyone can afford to uphold their values like this i can myself often not afford it and you could even argue that buying a headset at all is already against my values i do not think my headset choice makes me superior i do think though that you should fucking value your privacy and not be an angry jack if you do not think privacy is important say so otherwise protect yours instead of attacking me for telling you to do so you have a reasonable point but i really think you should work on your execution of trying to share it with others your posts came off really adversarial and immediately get people offside it is not the best way to bring something to light if you want people to take what you have to say seriously i guess you are right people feel attacked extreamly fast when you tell them to do the moral thing going slow enough to not offend them is hard and feels like a betrayal to my own values i need to work on myself there  at what stage have i implied that it was in active developement if you are interested in screwing around with ar mr on a budget you should consider a meta 2 no it is not that meta developer kit you can usually find one for dollar300 500 on ebay but if you are willing to wait for a deal to show up you can get them for less i just picked one up for dollar140 the tracking is not perfect but it is not bad the hand tracking can be a little hit or miss but gets better once you learn how to hold your hands the way it likes the company went out of business a few years ago so you will not be getting any support or updates but it is still very usable in its current state supports a proprietary api in unity as well as steamvr i have not messed with the steamvr support yet but it took me about half an hour to make a basic app in unity with minimal unity experience also has a 90 fov really can not go wrong if you are just looking for a cheap ar device to play with there is a vr ar headset that was already named meta before the fb oculus name change yep originally released in 2016 bet they are regretting the going out of business lol fun fact there is a meta 2 development headset in a cardboard box four feet from my desk right now please god someone get this out of my apartment 300 500 sounds totally fair and cheaper is fine if you will actually come here and get it bay area fwiw i was able to see spykids 3d but using the meta makes me want to hurl that said i never tinkered much with their final firmware update that was supposed to improve stability considerably alright once you get this proof of concept done get at me and we can design a 6dof headset with a qualcomm snapdragon running 2x 1440p passthrough cameras and 4x 480p tracking cameras lets make mixed reality compelling seriously i want my virtual workstation where i put on my headset see my field of virtual displays in my room office and still see my keyboard mouse coffee and spliff srsly mixed reality is exciting it still needs good hardware basically lynx but with hybrid aspheric fresnel lenses and a min 5k micro led display with retina tracking for realtime ipd adjustment and foveated rendering and a headset with a removable shroud and wigig instead of cables lets make this shit happen what kind of screen is on it is it like a phone screen with the vr kinda effect or is it 2 round screens or something like that it is like a tiny tablet screen the dual camera is will indeed split the screen for each eye 1024 by 600 that is rough for vr admirable project though the monitor supports full hd 1920 1080 i realise the quality is rough but i couldnt justify spending a large amount of money on a specialized screen money is a bit of a defining factor because if i up the camera is or screen more than other components then i almost automatically would have to invest in computing power and the other components to a higher level which quickly complicates the project and spirals out of control cost wise if my proof of concept works and i am confident enough in it maybe one day can start upgrading to a closer to modern standards build d gt the monitor supports full hd 1920 1080 it supports a 1080p signal but it is still going to display it at 1024 x 600 ah thats rough but i am glad i didnt go with the 480 x 600 that supports 1920 x 1080 then xd either way its not gonna be amazingly modern if you do a second revision order a replacement screen for a sony xperia z5 premium it is a 5 5 native 4k screen for dollar50 you will need board to convert the hdmi signal to something the display can handle but those are not too expensive they are popular for homebuilt projectors so there is plenty of info out there on how to get them setup to display an hdmi signal thank you thats something i would not have stumbled upon myself for that price it might be worthwhile to check it out even before the prototype is finished would you happen to have some resources for that a link or file of some sorts i believe diy perks on youtube was the one who popularized making it into a projector it does not look to me like it is actually dollar50 though his link for the 4k display control board leads to a bunch of dollar250 listings maybe there is another source of them that is still cheaper like aliexpress i am not sure everything you need in one box if you want to save some money and buy the parts separately you just need a phone display and an hdmi to mipi board make sure to check the board is specs and confirm it supports your panels resolution and uses the same connector really not much to it beyond that hook the board up to the lcd power on the board and plug in an hdmi source should work just like a regular monitor panelook com is the best place i know of for detailed specs on bare lcd panels look up the part number for whatever panel you are interested in on there and note what it says under signal interface then find a converter board with the same interface edit just remembered most of the 4k driver boards can only do 30hz which would be terrible for an hmd so you would probably want to go with a 1080p or 1440p panel do not have any specific recommendations for those but there are plenty of options out there any plans for the software looks like next vr kickstart project can get going try to beat up pimax and oculus record wouldnt be the most affordable way be to just use your phone absolutely but way less fun designing and solving the many problems that this idea poses  with diy while i first usually start it to save money i often end up with something that was as expensive as the commercial product and is not even working good d however what i learned from all my diy projects over time is absolutely priceless and cannot be bought so easy oh yeah my cheapest option comment was semi sarcastic there are absolutely cheaper more cost effective ways but it feels cheaper  i suspect they also have fun doing it kind of the idea for diy projects for serious development oculus gives developers way too many hurdles you can build apps for quest in the way that oculus wants you to actual control over the device is not an option with oculus that is the facebook walled garden worst thing that ever happened to vr and there is people that actually think facebook is good for vr total idiots op is not going to develop a standalone headset as far as i can tell maybe i am wrong in that case the quest 2 is a cheap and easy way to develop for pcvr oculus just opened up pass through to devs so shitty mixed reality is now open side loading on to your own device does not require a paid dev license unlike apple pretty much anyone can do it and get reasonably decent access to the hardware the underlying architecture is just android so lots of tools available including unity i am not a facebook fan by any means but after years of apple development i might have some insight i would guess facebook is practically required to do this to attract developers for what is a much much smaller market than apple might be still wondering what the unlocked bootloader of the oculus go will bring us note that in my experience to fully utilize the pi4 gpu you need to go 64bit just fyi to save you a headache in discovery as default raspbian is 32bit what are you gonna use as controllers it is cool and all but how is this any different from say google cardboard that you can get for like dollar20 this is a full hmd not a piece of cardboard to stick a phone into yeah but it is a phone screen powered by an rpi your not running desktop vr applications with a pi for many reasons at least not in a way that you can not get a phone to do anyway eg streaming i just can not really see what additional practical capabilities this would have that using a phone woulde not as he says experimenting with mixed reality by using multiple cameras and passing the augmented video to the screen sure you could maybe do that with a phone if you had a compatible phone and knew how to program for android but android probably does not quite have the freedom to experiment as freely ahh this reminds me of 2014 2015 era very nice reminds me of oculus dk1 here we go again i hope this one does not sell out the rift and are both open source you may want to start by replicating one and you will quickly find that putting a screen in front of some lenses is by far the easiest part of creating a viable vr hmd it seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users i will extend those so they are easier for our sausage fingers to click please pm with issues or feedback you are nuts nice remindme one month no luck lets see if with more time we get an update remindme 3 months any update sadly not u captain infinite probably abandoned the project the project is not exactly abandoned but on a bit of a backburner i bought a way higher res screen which also fit better unfortunately the screen is not playing nice with the camera is so i have been trying to find solutions and get familiar with several software things when i have more fun things to show i will make a dedicated post here we go again remindme 6 months also u patchouli psalter you might be interested in this i will be messaging you in 6 months on to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can thanks we are doing it again lol hey alright sounds good what have you been working on lately i will be messaging you in 3 months on to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can lol felt that i will be messaging you in 1 month on to remind you of to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can no pics yet but it looks like he is not done you still need a meta account for that facebook absolutely thats the first thing that gets implemented s the oculus thrift i love that it really will feel like one haha interest so if you build a 3dof pc headset then how much do it cost for example same level as oculus go but for pc no he is building a 6dof any thoughts on using a coral edge tpu and slam toolbox to do 6dof tracking edit nevermind on slam toolbox it is for 2d slam i want to get the coral but they are completely unavailable to me until q2 of at least 2022 so i am going to do as much as i can without it at first another opensource headset you want to steal ideas from with blackjack and hookers nice i use to build vr headsets years ago it feels great when you put it all together congrats do you feel luckey punk do ya looks great man check out the garbage one i made in 2012 some tips weight adds up strip everything unnecessary cables too you probably do not have one of those crazy oculink cables so hdmi audio usb will add weight pull to the hmd try to use a breakout box or something on your waist leap motion might be an interesting solution for controllers it was not that good when i used it mounted to the hmd but i heard it got a lot better good luck with the 6dof i have no idea how to do that but gt crappiest yet most affordable the diy vr headset cost more than the dk1 the display was the most expensive part your submission has been removed because we do not allow url shorteners i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please message compose to r virtualreality if you have any questions or concerns bad bot thank you dzuczek for voting on automoderator this bot wants to find the best and worst bots on reddit even if i do not reply to your comment i am still listening for votes check the webpage to see if your vote registered you may want to check out relativity vr a group doing the same exact thing just with no tracker very interesting tech and the drivers may come in handy for you have you looked at the oculus dk1 there might be something there you could use also the osvr project has a partially open source led camera tracking system that might be worth looking at you could try using april tags as a poc tracking setup for 6dof not too knowledgeable in computer vision but might be worth a look that is really neat is it a custom pcb board it is a raspberry pi 4b for now but i am unsure for how long that will stay sufficient in processing power any alternatives for eventual upgrades are always welcome that looks like a fun project hope you continue posting updates here if i have interesting progress to show i will definitely show it d  certainly thank you for your kind words i love garage builds makers make cudos bro bon voyage i would love to follow this project oh look here is a really inspiring and fun looking diy project let me tell you all the reasons why buying a finished product will give you better results haha its good to sometimes have people be honest about it as long as there remains a balance  this is my dream project how are you doing it how much does will it cost i am just learning as i am going along i do not have too much of a concrete plan at the moment sometimes you gotta run before you can walk this is a hobby project and not meant to be the start of a product so moneywise it will be whatever i am willing to spend on upgrades and parts  science is not about why it is about why not how strong is the hdmi connection its pretty strong i wouldnt wack it with a hammer or drop it on the floor but its not gonna fall off with every nudge i did that a couple of years ago with an arduino duo reminds me of a young mark zuckerberg do not sell it to facebook noted might sell to meta though s this could go either two ways good luck with the project keep us updated thank you will do i would love to see updates to this venture if you have not already maybe put it in the rpi sub and have them shoot you some support great idea thanks for the kind words very interesting it would be cool to see if people started actually modding vr headsets and not doing like fov mod and stuff like that like actual mods like replacing a display on a headset and giving it a higher display one looks like a fun diy project enjoy your time gt i am building my own vr headset amp x200b with blackjack amp hookers actually forget the vr headset and the blackjack is not there an open source vr headset there are multiple but one more can never hurt do not pin me on this becoming a fully open source project hey guess who tried doing that when they were for legal reasons 13  yo yours looks sick i am sorry that the reactions on your post were so weirdly negative did you go on to develop it further oh it is completely fine and no pi 0 is are not very quick in all honesty the most affordable way to do vr is the quest 2 you will not be able to build anything yourself for cheaper than it if you really want cheap you can do google cardboard or one of those not cardboard but still dollar100 things the ones that were released around the time the original oculus rift cv1 was released even if all the components are cheaper than a quest 2 you will spend at least 2x that because you will find that some parts are not compatible and will need to spend extra on the plastic housings and stuff just to hold them all together that is not to mention the huge amount of time this project would require months at minimum have you thought of how you will actually get content onto the device and use it there will be a ton of programming required to make anything render in passthrough and if you try to program it all yourself then it will only work with art assets that you personally made you can not import some fbx model and expect it to just work you will need to figure out what libraries are compatible then how to set up those libraries with your passthrough video how to do virtual lighting in those libraries because if you do not the object is either pitch black or it will look like a flat silhouette and not 3d at all because it is the shading and shadows that indicate shape just try making something in unity without giving it any texture or material in other words this is months of work if you have done all this before and a multi year project if you have not and what would you get from it at the end a vr ar headset which has almost no content only you know how to use and which has no commercialization potential i am sorry to give you bad news like that but there is a truth that you must follow if you want to use your time usefully use the tools that already exist do not re invent the wheel existing headsets are those tools please save yourself the months of frustration and wasted time because yes that time will be wasted even if other people try to jump in with he will learn a ton that time is not wasted you will learn things that will never be useful elsewhere it will be 1percent as useful as learning a broader skillset which is in demand there are no vr hardware jobs for people without at least a college degree in the applicable fields so even if that job is your specific goal you are better off studying it in college then maybe some headset could be a capstone thesis project and would at least have use for the degree there is a reason there are 100x as many companies creating apps games and programs that run on headsets than there are companies creating headsets i say this as someone who has made hardware devices from scratch and learned this stuff the hard way this man is learning stuff it is about the journey not the destination fax the route is the goal the cake is a lie just saying i am a webdesigner by day and really have been wanting to build anything but didnt have any drive or good inspiration when i found r cyberdeck a while back i knew what i wanted to do all the points you make are valid however i am not driven by any deadlines or needing to create a product that can be sold this project is completely for fun thanks for being real with me but i considered everything you said before i dove into the project and still decided the fun would be worth my time d good to hear i always worry that these things are started by someone young and without significan not resources but in your case you are fine i am sure you will have the expected balance of fun and frustration in the project go for it keep on going gt even if all the components are cheaper than a quest 2 you will spend at least 2x that because you will find that some parts are not compatible and will need to spend extra on the plastic housings and stuff just to hold them all together that is not to mention the huge amount of time this project would require months at minimum what if one is looking for a linux compatible pcvr headset where the quest 2 is not an option then the best comparison should be a used vive not an oculus quest 2 and in this case depending on which parts one sources one may be able to get better displays than the original vive has making something oneself also allows one to verify that it is quality and repairable a rare trait in today is hardware there are not many headsets out there that meet my standards for reparability and openness so i would certainly consider creating my own eventually if no new options come up that are good gt have you thought of how you will actually get content onto the device and use it there will be a ton of programming required to make anything render in passthrough and if you try to program it all yourself then it will only work with art assets that you personally made you can not import some fbx model and expect it to just work you will need to figure out what libraries are compatible then how to set up those libraries with your passthrough video how to do virtual lighting in those libraries because if you do not the object is either pitch black or it will look like a flat silhouette and not 3d at all because it is the shading and shadows that indicate shape just try making something in unity without giving it any texture or material in other words this is months of work if you have done all this before and a multi year project if you have not and what would you get from it at the end a vr ar headset which has almost no content only you know how to use and which has no commercialization potential why would everything need to be from scratch program a driver for steamvr or monado that way off the shelf software will work these are open platforms designed to be extensible by third parties this could also be made much easier by using steamvr tracking which i believe can also be used with existing free open source drivers gt this could also be made much easier by using steamvr tracking basestation dollar100 dollar150 per piece vive tracker dollar100 dollar150 per piece tundra tracker dollar100 per piece the problem with lighthouse tracking is that you get entire used cv1 or wmr sets on ebay for the price of the tracking system alone again that has linux compatibility problems even when using reverse engineered solutions cv1 is not supported and wmr does not have controller support and this still does not solve the problem of wanting a headset that is very easy to repair because it was built diy in the first place nor gives the advantage of current off the shelf display panels being potentially higher resolution are 1440x1440 at 120 fps and therefore beat my used vive in these areas gt basestation dollar100 dollar150 per piece ironically the best deal on this may be by buying an entire used vive mine was dollar250 including base stations controllers and the hmd itself so in all honesty the most practical solution of cheap linux pcvr is almost certainly a used vive which is good yes in fact it is quite reliable and most parts are easy to repair it is the best off the shelf headset for this that i have found but i would like something where it is easy for me to swap out the display panels and lenses so i can get a better display for this i would want to keep my existing tracking while upgrading the hmd and then when i upgrade the hmd only upgrade part of it rather than the entire thing the competition here are the vive pro and valve index which are significan notly more expensive and come with built in headphones which i prefer to avoid in favour of using my own gt vive tracker dollar100 dollar150 per piece gt gt tundra tracker dollar100 per piece i would want to use integrated tracking with a module not something tacked on top of the hmd that option which is actually a more expensive than the trackers currently i wonder why more tracking points but can get a constellation of tracking points over a larger area that is integrated into the hmd might also use something based on attila is diy base station trackers wip if it ends up cheaper or more reliable for the same spread of points annoyingly i cannot find a homepage url for it right now i am planning to build this first as i would really like full body tracking but have not found a single option where it is easy to replace the battery going diy would ensure that since i can make it i can also tear it apart and repair it when the battery inevitably stops holding charge because that is always the issue for me either the cable or battery i was not trying to advocate buying these headsets i was just complaining about the price of lighthouse tracking gt cv1 is not supported thaytan is openhmd fork with his tracking implementation is supported including controller inputs gt and wmr does not have controller support true it is being hacked on but progress is not the fastest gt i would want to use integrated tracking with a module like this out of stock the shortage strikes again has this ever been available what surprises me is that nobody has replicated the old starvr setup yet what if i told you that unai seems to have gotten a decent amount of funding i had the same thoughts but probably would have just responded with a snarky r diwhy thanks for sharing r diwhy some of the things on there made me laugh very hard d i am glad you got a laugh out of it and that you seem to be doing this project for your own amusement and edification good luck you clearly have no idea why somebody starts such a project d what you call bad news is an opportunity to learn for open minded people i am sure the message that they were trying to convey to me was cautional and not strictly negative i appreciate the honesty keep that attitude gt you clearly have no idea why somebody starts such a project d you should have read the last line of my post and i did not include my fuller history i created a company that makes robots that remove landmines i built much of our early hardware myself and programmed it myself before i began hiring employees after more than a year of getting the project going as both a technical project and as a company you are talking to one of the people who has literally started a technical project and turned it into a successful company thats great i never questioned your expertise i just implied that any kind of success is not the main goal of the project but having fun in doing it achieving something that shows it can work and learning a lot when doing it building something on your own also gives you a much deeper understanding of how it works i think with your background you know that really cool that you do such an important work thumbs up for that the next palmer luckey so he is going to duct tape a bunch of hardware he can not get working properly together and hope a legendary programmer that lives nearby shows up to do all the hard parts do not insult op like that s this is gonna go a long way remindme one month would not it be easier to 6dof an unlocked go perhaps but probably not as fun agreed and you might just be on to something i do not really know how it works but oli imagine you would need some software to connect to a pc or steamvr how easy do you reckon that will be to implement i do not expect the word easy to apply to that just hard and difficult but i am willing to spend time and effort to get there haha yeah that is more accurate i always thought once vr becomes mainstream headsets will become like pc is and people will build their own with parts from different companies well good on you for doing that it is pretty awesome that your building your own and make sure to keep reddit updated well it is gonna be pretty hard to play anything if you have to hold that giant green rectangle to it all the time oh shoot you are right i better solve that soon remindme one month yea this seems safe safety is overrated anyway ok and if you are interested we are working on the lenovo mirage solo it basically has what you want but on a defunct android platform at the very least we have a dev kit 6dof controller that needs cloning and might fit well with your project this is the punk part of cyberpunk i did get my inspiration from r cyberdeck so thats completely correct d remindme 2013 the classic realtek audio controller is it a raspberry pi controlling the thing and also how did you make the frame is it 3d printed both those assumptions are correct although i also have a huge bin of scrap metal to use so when needed i can give it a little more structural integrity weight strength is a bit of a balancing act when building somthing that hangs of the face so hows it going sorry for the necro but if you are still active how did you manage the distortion for the panels to counter the distortion from the lenses and how did you manage to display two images on the panel\n"

pico took 0 5percent steam userbase november quest 2 lost 0 4percent rate take 40 months pico overtakes quest 2 3 years meta time launch 1 2 new entry level headsets time hand november usually fast month purchasing toys us market missing figures december january interesting bit virtual desktop also interesting means numbers basically useless choosing ignore future data usable also wanted note way understand guy godin developer virtual desktop said virtual desktop shows quest2 people running pico 4 vd show quest 2 steam vr essentially giving wrong statistics might wrong read something along line yes understood fixed statistics virtually useless think really hard make clear analysis hmd even available us market nice see competitors trying got success even limited range pico 4 great product price better value quest 2 sure terms hardware hardware good head everything display port dog shit connection wise problems got past apk region locks fact using virtual desktop app native yet rofl connection stable oculus link controllers recently got better tracking firmware update also matching meta reliability headset half weight better fan lenses 5mm intervals pid adjustment even published range meaning longer get motion sickness absolute game changer talking visual quality well less nits quite sure referring visual quality unless comparing air link vs displayport compression air link nits man even 20percent brightness plenty personally quest lower even usually lol nits much light teachers eyes even lower quest 2 quest 2 low overall ok product leaves lot desired though good competition meta hope well means pico 4 bright quest 2 sounds like paper spec low number bad experience dramatically better every way regarding display brightness never thought maybe need compare side side side side pretty clear quest brighter pico image kind looks desaturated think marketing campaign pico forget owns lol accurate ipd adjustment 5mm fresnel distortion better fan half weight less chromatic aberration cured motion sickness tripled vr legs overnight vr gaming actually possible legitimately could happen quest 2 limitations longer 30min well deserved currently best value pcvr seems good see real alternatives market prevent us getting locked walled gardens really see pico less walled garden meta connecting pc walls standalone store support side loading yeah never got concept quest every oculus meta headset always allowed connect pc use steamvr want use oculus store always thought apple comparison silly meta actually allows download third party apps use third party stores apple people want complain meta data handling privacy practices fine also like pico owned large chinese corporation owns tik tok known share data chinese gov wild pico meta literally almost exactly comes faults people embraced pico whole still shitting meta even though agree stupid go pico 4 reason choose go quest data privacy issues equally suck ass department think got people going pico closest quest competitor require account use pcvr still would allow device wifi network without seriously locking lol gt think got people going pico closest quest competitor require account use pcvr part nearly got buy one yeh never gotten issue use native quest cable link air link play pc vr steam games via official link program amazingly well issues quest pro additionally use virtual desktop wish oculus store 100percent optional tethered use every pure tethered headset require pc meta quest pico better giving flexibility solo standalone options along giving better actual performance vive tracking wank valve index res bad every setup downsides upsides seems like big patch sour grapes people wanting pony money new headsets nevermind board company many chinese govt officials whatever want data chose gt also like pico owned large chinese corporation owns tik tok known share data chinese gov us companies share data us government europe ruled meta data privacy quest 2 sold germany pico though gt wild pico meta literally almost exactly comes faults people embraced pico whole still shitting meta even though gt wild pico meta literally almost exactly comes

good privacy meta accounts give fake name since positive id requirement meta account well unless something goes wrong meta account need recover tricky gave fake name pico never name begin gt yeah never got concept quest every oculus meta headset always allowed connect pc use steamvr remembering correctly oculus never made headsets work steam vr valve instead made steamvr work oculus headsets like virtual desktop made possible quest headsets stream pcvr due demand oculus meta eventually released airlink oculus attempting closed ecosystem since day 1 oculus store community 1 step ahead every time remembering correctly owned every oculus headset since dk1 except pro worked colleges vrlab around time vive released 2 years valve made steamvr api compatible oculus vive even released literally like week reason oculus done yet time one consumer vr options vive outside couple open source headsets basically copies dk2 even taking account fact vive oculus touch controllers headset really offered motion controls outside either modding pseye wands work colleges vrlab pretty using razer motion controllers forget specific name yes valve made highest selling consumer grade headset time compatible newer ecosystem like beneficial valve also airlink already development awhile like oculus sent cease desist made take application still use oculus made protocol seeing people clamoring time oculus really went closed ecosystem route shutting vive port allowed steamvr headsets use oculus store gt yes valve made highest selling consumer grade headset time compatible newer ecosystem like beneficial valve highest selling consumer headset time htc vive rift launched xbox controller forward facing experience essentially joke introduced touch added support cameras cut price half whole rift launch complete rushed mess trying play catch valve new headset gt time oculus really went closed ecosystem route issue oculus never official way get third party headset ecosystem back use hacks worse yet even manage support headsets properly rift always locked venues quest1 got locked horizon go abandoned forgotten horizon also still region locked hell recommend reading oculus facebook meta bit locked competition accident whole point ar vr zuckerberg sees ar vr next big computing platform wants control something failed smartphone space google apple control everything way fix controlling whatever technology comes smartphones referencing pre vive vive even launched made cv1 previous oculus headsets compatible steamvr time cv1 highest selling consumer grade headset yes allow headsets onto platform taking apple approach closing ecosystem benefits detriments turning people platform difference apple allow third party apps allow system work ecosystems basically respect actually think facebook good job us atm mean though attractive alternatives prevent platform get dominant e g able limit usability steam sidequest 3rd party platforms agree think accessible prices allow better insertion market exponentially motivate larger amount developers willing contribute growth seems controversial opinion moment personally think meta correct regards vr ar next step gaming enterprises social gathering technology several different branches usually helps sedimentation 30 years ago medium small company website saw need nowadays even florist website think metaverses ought go somewhere shape form said right everyone likes look back internet early 90s rose colored glasses course good things majority thought useless waste time use email perfectly good postal service direct quote get idea wall street also downplayed significance dot com bubble denial hype cynicism see parallels present back initial denial period tech even possible went ar vr metaverse hype bust cynical phase people always expect instant results technological advancement feels like metaverse internet 95 things take time know tech everywhere people wonder life like xr similar analogy 20 25 years ago first consoles coming either rich lucky one choice hardware software limited someone play online pipe dream years later consoles evolved playstations xboxes nintendos etc market flooded choice prices stable enough mass adoption course fun nowadays everyone sort console homes ball rolling like meta billion dollar company seems going expecting least small impact medium long run would say jumping early think paving enlarging path using corpses hopes reaping dividends line overall think meta know future going shared many giants trying sediment layer early possible good point think variety mercy single company gt mercy single company valve single company like company change fact monopoly still bad course binary case depends talking case something like steam may quite different yes know multiple companies making vr terms cheap decent standalone vr pico pretty much oculus meta edit grammar gt really see pico less walled garden meta install apks straight main menu along access

macbook built basically cheapest xcode capable device buy dollar1000 dollar1400 since m2 would start m2 capable macbooks add ar capabilities 3d camera capabilities price bad get lot stuff might need wanted vr experiences surprised one mentioned tether looks like goes puck pocket external battery pack goes pocket lasts 2 hours ah nice apple burn hole pocket twice gave external battery even power long enough watch movie apps presented price yikes mean could buy swap batter low low price dollar999 dollar1999 want battery fancy wheels xd good point remember reading something confirming battery proprietary connector also plug walking around like wall clearly compromise needed happy also notice tim cook announced ar headset fan vr even want mention even mixed reality yeah entire thing ar focused mention vr environments even want really emphasize encompassing yet continuously environments pretty clearly trying get people ask quest store steam vr also never used word game end play games augmented flat screen ps5 controller also name dropped unity games software avoiding talking competition vr space intentionally want developers make games want laypeople start looking get quest pcvr far less money already know absolutely never said virtual reality 3d games play existing apple arcade games even showed person using game controller think ps5 controller 100percent sure later presentation specifically games never said vr gaming mean even attempting reinvent ar spacial computing absolutely ridiculous apple maybe explains demonstrate anything really vr showed gaming giant virtual screen vr games incredible looking bit hardware really odd pinch zoom without controller cool headset seems good making feel like wearing headset seem much make feel like virtual reality saddens greatly video anyone missed keynote pixel count reveal interesting truly looks crystal clear headset future said price suspect v2 v3 true mainstream support suspect apple knows well named pro reason imo impressive tech wonder customer segment actually thoughts seen others talk good technical marvel technical perspective blow mainstream competition away powerful standalone headset high resolution display quality excellent build quality excellent hand amp eye tracking knowing apple audio good iris scanning etc user interface looks polished access apple ios mac ecosystem day one huge advantage quest pro add onto apple experience prosumer space external battery pack expect many disagree think battery external allows front load devices weighting switch batteries one dies connect power directly without still carrying battery weight works bt keyboard mice absolute win productivity depend good passthrough quality given much focus apple mr great right focus 2d amp traditional applications gives hope first one get productivity side vr mr right mixed hand tracking get wrong company nail hand tracking ux apple fact till next year get live demo hand tracking concerning strap simple front loaded mount strap compresses face given productivity device surely ergonomic halo strap would better long session comfortability hope case apple choosing form function moving battery external help competitors use plastic glass metal see battery life seems short given external battery probably big deal voice control reliance voice control especially typing text worried device perform non english speakers thick accent keyboard connectivity hand tracking exist probably fine either way price price absurd see argument replacing computer tablet tv monitor etc one device actually cheaper dev kit developers early adopters cheaper device coming year two though apple marketing masters probably still ship concerns optional controllers seems like lost opportunity vr mr industry gaming biggest sector far right hardcore gaming apple expertise still successful vr games right arcade style games would gel apple vibe well quick peek limited information sdk unity support looks tools build great games exist optional controllers existed could also let valve pcvr developers heavy lifting porting hardcore vr games macos mention fitness applications probably second biggest vr software market right one right apple alley apple watch mindfulness vr app etc bit surprised really expected apple double mindfulness reveal sell apple vision pro lifestyle current vr workout apps great kind weird exclusion although expect third party developers cook something got worried strap tight stay activity additional thoughts would surprised apple limit close eyes objects allowed get vergence accommodation conflict immersion breaking could see apple hyper focusing ux could explain focus 2d applications wonder mainstream players stake different section vr market sony medium high end gaming market quest low end mass market approach apple high end productivity space etc different approach till either vr mr dies becomes mainstream replace laptop two additional monitors mic

watch vision pro career great interest scene dude watching kids play headset dystopian looking straight black mirror like play kid take headset literally exactly scene minority report tom cruise

gogles doughters birthday imagine wife like shit steven supposed return xd xd xd spatial computing everything 2d surfaces feel could built lot genuine volumetric 3d apps avatars etc finally someone noticing headsets still 2d interfaces x maybe take evolve design depth mind would require developing new apps considering size usebase pricepoint nobody going developing new apps specifically device issues current vr gamedev low install base low profits lack development even worse think apple realised wisely honestly focussed projecting existing apps 2d surfaces honestly really surprised negative reaction subreddit attention detail hardware innovations shown presentation astonishing trying support adoption vr even deliver hype headset achieved huge milestones waiting hear years regardless cost least apple used resources disposal make strongest push history industry make headset alone commendable price negative reaction lack good vr gaming expected displays sensors audio overall hardware design impressive agreed pretty apple person turned vision pro mulling bit clear positioning springboard visionos world tight control exert app store remains intact fine mobile device dollar3500 pro device unacceptable really eliminates attractive edge cases make expensive vr setups worth effort gut tells apple win generation devices near term anyways see beyond business case create something advocates platform put another way ios app store unlocked potential smartphones made things easier consumers appear true visionos apple essentially entering vr headset market eventually outpriced hungrier competitors shackled need service app store model apple user curious opinion think apple may seeing complementary straight portable replacement mac ecosystem sure much tight control apple mac ecosystem especially vs ios recent trends merge two correct wrong seems like visionos may eventually go way snag developers visionos ecosystem get industry favoured apps specific workflows final cut esque thing see apple gaining lot ground xr space thing companies need buy gigantic scenario strapping goggles head extended periods time remains huge physical barrier goes way beyond wearing something wrist think apple sees another way interact becoming platform agnostic blob applications able function across different surfaces surface happens experimental bleeding edge potential dud take world could see outcome apple right editing videos minority report like environment type workflow truly productive requires apple allow visionos software things wholly comfortable ios accomplishing jury way way think apple would love ignored complex heady stuff completely content simply consuming media simple visionos exclusive apps simple things like imessage hangouts etc think apple definitely sees future consumer desktop computing mac laptops basically terminals ar ecosystem personally think killer use case microsoft announced hololens despite flaws thought direction going apple showed basically always envisioned vr early reviews people demoing including apple skeptics like mkbhd pretty stellar imagine two moores law cycles devices 1 4 small 1 4 price apple winner imo small time filmmaker interested camera technology involved apple makes great cameras seen easy great photo video thing pocket like idea first person perspective used documentaries specialized shots short films gaming sub want spend 3500 device really game r vrgaming though sub things virtual reality better job presenting multi faceted device professionals quest pro differences presentation marketing devices stark quest pro lot potential labeled apple taking grounded approach telling straight hey feature sets available day one dollar3499 price point imagine professionals audience appealing average

even personal device played hard toward non business crowd confused could never seen regular person buying price like looks really great technical standpoint maybe even worth money like varjo aero good totally hands average person even enthusiasts maybe price think vr enthusiasts would least like know play vr games use steam anyone convinced ar even thing going look cool totally unattainable hope gives people least somewhat better idea ar actually capable real device mention also stuck apple ecosystem gt pretty sure even hardcore apple fans used dishing dollar3500 even personal device reason people showed demoing device lived mansions wore designer clothes lol think made right choice go tech regardless cost going sell lot start positioned replacement computer screen speakers smart like macbook could easily set back dollar2 3k people replacing laptops gen 1 probably years knows agree seems super odd put much tech advertising desktop movie viewer use case people enjoy using ar vr mean use case definitely nice sitting around friends made big screen watch movie throw popcorn around good times would expect main use case headset 2 3 times expensive even quest pro headset many people buy similar features like color passthrough eye face tracking good lenses standalone vr pcvr content bad headset means see fact technical marvel possibly built ground os ask world going buy expensive device bring aboard plane watch movies definitely main stickler well better competition quest pro almost well less 1 3rd cost capable far honestly even seems optimistic 2 hour battery life even enough movies vision pro incredibly niche device trying create market yet exist price point far high even vr enthusiasts shows potential next decade far offers anything today gt use case people enjoy using ar vr well yet device even function use case apple seems pretty confident thing used movies reading text without feeling like downgrade regular monitor tv expensive hold back technology innovation would rather way years progress get cheaper want cheap quest thought gonna price mac level prices better throw everything got terms technology pretty ideal positioning essentially things needs usable primary compute device let things would normally normal computing devices spatially different vr headset show preview experience spatial computing low resolution spotty accuracy questionable controls lack comfort jank ar people complaining price anchored subsidized vr consoles get annoyed realize apple skipped making toys dove straight eventual end game computing interfaces thus price relates high end computing devices like mac books pros gaming first devices like consoles yeah thing think people appreciating far complete device getting vr ar space supposed complement anything supposed encompassing device still need mac though unless want limit ipad apps technical specs mentioned say 12 ms per frame translates 90 hz also displays pixels 4k tv per eye 12ms referring passthrough latency though oh catch thanks longtime since 2015 vr user absolutely phenomenal needs praise instead putting apple chewing pricesticker quest competitor vr gamingconsole made several parties first kind spatial computing device focus working first time entertainment second understandably beginning important apple took plunge introduced completely new experience tech evolve bye bye screens completely new experience working harder watching tv except new exactly people shortsighted see means price tag first iphone also cost way much people used paying phone back look back ipod iphone conceptualized ipod could make phone calls ipod cassette tape walkman cd rw disc players maybe primitive mp3 players around time nothing customer facing design os built looks cool would pay dollar1000 looks lovely immediate thought big concave single piece glass front going get scratched hell first time put face counter accident think going cheap replace clip plastic cover going

initially general public got might well quest pro face even worse puck dangling quite surprised little emphasis ar little overlays real world real mention shared space interactions really long time focusing pretty well established almost boring uses vr ar watching movies viewing photos etc codec avatars really cool probably super annoying meta see apple introducing world literally saying invented many things nothing micro oled screens invented apple really way consumer emphasis expected priced feel like really needs strong professional use case sell literally discussion professional apps architecture engineering biology etc apps even quest pro surprised see mention type use case definitely sets bar think gives plenty room others pitch cheaper slightly worse devices midrange dollar1k 2k quest pro sits need see someone wearing real life understand gawky really looks looks weird pictures photos seen think totally undoes work done overcome isolation etc eyesight etc fov

cheaper anyone remembers first iphone basically really slick ipod made phone calls nothing radically new got app store 3g internet capability may underwhelm bit right expect version 2 knock rest way park price tag ridiculously steep features look great seemingly well developed product impressive specs tech imagine years generations refinement could something special first gen iphone kind sucked first gen apple watch sucked proved concept years later improved drastically every aspect software features processing battery power changed respective industries first gen products always stink bit never worth average consumer common knowledge tech world hope kickstarts consumer interest vr outside enthusiast space currently occupies think kind goal specific model device bring ar vr mainstream

entirely concentrated front headset buy halo strap like bobovr m2 plus pro get improvement comfort ergonomics still want get new headset non standalone bigscreen beyond think reverb g2 good terms visuals seems comfortable however tracking bit finnicky windows mixed reality discontinued starting 2027 recommend get one point pimax crystal someone recommended pretty expensive one heaviest headsets available weights almost kilogram main target audience people seek best possible image quality comfort maybe good option high res headset good comfort pico 4 one headset weights bit rift 584 grams vs 563 grams extremely well balanced since unlike quest battery located back headset probably even comfortable wear rift pico 4 weights 295 grams front buy amvr face pad pico 4 default one bit hard comfortable headset pcvr pancake lenses resolution similar quest 3 review someone owned rift got pico 4 seems found pico 4 bit comfortable wear rift hi everyone wanted say thank great suggestions far also information rift quest 2 actually similar weights head strap makes difference definitely appreciating 3rd party head strap suggestions well yea get head strap sure legit understand anyone even remotely wears q2 native head strap instant go bobo went kiwi comfort straps come built battery pack balance weight nicely definitely weight distribution raw weight quest 3 slightly heavier quest 2 yet way comfortable highly recommend bobovr m2 quest 2 used upgraded quest 3 made comfortable primax crystal quite expensive great quality supposedly pico neo 3 link cheaper fresnel displayport standalone mode also also pico bland colors also dpvr e4 would rather get pico tbh sad displayport inside options based ops post looking light headset unless wrong crystal notoriously known heavy ah right yeah primax helmet big headsets like valve index 800 grams varjo aero 750 grams usually front heavy pimax crystal weighs 850 grams 1 3 weight battery distributed back head making less front heavy feels lighter due better weight distribution balance crystal extremely bulky weight fun fact avp heavier crystal include battery 650 headset 350 battery yeah well battery head could weigh 1kg care weight distribution important indeed weight still weight use bobovr s3 also battery back balances q3 weight still feel balanced heavy better front heavy light better yeah also great quality pimax sentence makes cringe bit also terrible build quality one friends one whenever playing vr together anyone hear headset creaking also crystal technically one company named primax makes vr hardware loool legit thought primax right hp reverb g2 though would get one since seems life support interested well q3 tried several different comfort kits end day heavy headset would gotten beyond requires base stations index controllers mention people saying sweet spot small move head instead eyes cannot go back using q3 hope get next couple years wouldnt hold breath beyonds sweet spot dependent cushion depth basically need eye lashes touch fully get max fov best possible edge edge clarity made headset even double weight q3 fov edge edge clarity would buy heart beat small form factor limits room scale things bit easier overcome anything seated bit noticable constantly moving head ahhh exactly sad pcvr headset without compromise wish headset everything downside expensive beyond really went light possible hit take clarity fov imo worth compromise say headset slightly heavier beyond better fov clarity first choice tech unfortunately nothing done without compromise quest 3 sort feels like absolute compromise headset exception lenses everything mediocre okay comfort anyone wide head atrocious though beyond small size meant short perceived focal distance gave eye strain made shortcomings bit much bare personally someone made headset 2500 3000 pixel oled displays index q3 fov edge edge clarity q3 audio valve index package weighed ballpark q3 index would happy shell lot money wireless would nice bonus requirement well basically mythological deckard bad rumors far pretty much boat fucking nothing would get crystal like 1 2kg supposedly dpvr working high end headset sliver hope guess windows 10 need upgrade 11 time soon fine subpar tracking could get used g2 super comfortable image quality great dpvr e4 immersed visor coming year weighs 200g 4k per eye screens passthrough inside tracking wired wireless capability according ceo demos happening q2 year gt rift back figured would give spin instantly amazed much lighter compared quest 2 something weird story rift weight headstrap 590 g quest 2 weight headstrap 503 g get better headstrap bobovr better comfort weight distribution use website find headset suit needs based replies seen think may really head strap thank link well looks like great resource recommend kiwi design head strap one battery substantially heavier vanilla quest 3 much comfortable 4 hours playtime bobo vr headstrap seem little solid got headstrap battery less bobo vr headstrap without battery fair point doubt rift hardware much lighter actually generate graphics way quest 2 mostly looking light headset full processor inside makes something heavier get quest 3 cares function standalone device wireless pcvr well think needing base stations implies inside tracking kind requires hardware comes standalone headset pimax crystal require base stations wired extremely heavy op looking think headset trackers around room oculus cv1 seem want headset lighthouses also known base stations since want headset track read title rift still 500 grams similar weight quest probably weight distribution sitting head gives illusion lot lighter really negligible strap distributes weight across head important part many third party strap options quest help quest 2 issue mostly weight distribution instead actual weight would probably try used quest pro pico 4 instead since better weight distribution also try quest 2 3 third party headstrap much else really xr4 absurdly expensive work well vr games crystal 1kg add two quest 2 house quest 3 used bobovr halo straps batteries comfy well balanced even notice weight even wear facial interface face breath got pimax crystal sale amazon dollar1223 us bout 3 weeks ago steal thought daily ride still quest pcvr pimax crystal always go going list pros blows away headsets used used rift quest2 3 main one though display port usb3 2 port keeps battery 100percent charged hrs use granted quest headset always fully charged displayport means getting uncompressed video fussing bout encoding decoding bit rate settings oculus tools etc one sweet thing though didnt think bout switch choose standalone pcvr mode missed much rift always hated bs quest starts standlone annoys greatly missed feature rift much feels good pcvr dedicated headset cannot stress great free quest link willing step price get grab quest 3 great headset price weight fine hrs use yes put quest headset lie amazed much lighter feels want pcvr go pimax crystal close whatsoever 4k per eye dynamic foveated rendering 200 nits light dimming etc mid range pc go quest 3 standalone citravr etc also always play wired want play wireless think pimax crystal yet also lack passthrough atm something think bout got aftermarket strap rear battery old q2 although added weight headset balanced better comfortable hp reverb g2 really good terms resolution inside tracked wmr officially deprecated future headset air looking good happy using windows 10 care upgrading windows 11 fine replacing headset couple years hp reverb g2 probably best bet pick one cheap main downsides g2 controller tracking slightly worse quest2 windows mixed reality platform popular vive index oculus therefore well supported software main usage simracing similar g2 works great want resolution could also get quest 3 nice headstrap hey guys index worth buying 2023 kinda sorta base stations controllers good would recommend bsb afford ok joke lol thanks answer index since launch got q3 couple months ago way make knuckles work q3 using index dongle enough time q3 controllers bad think next quest upgrade pro controllers ya backstreet boys put good show used right price yes new 2024 2017 picked complete index kit second hand ebay last week gbp540 used 10 hours looks brand new would buy one full price though headset base stations controllers want pair crystal bsb upcoming somnium maybe avp seems like got work pancakes yummy lmao nothing else comes close terms audio quality especially without headphones touching ears also

think compete level bang buck going cv1 index huge letdown still using instead day wish headset like terms weight controllers fov pixels would tick boxes literally quest 3 care much oled displays similar controllers higher fov pixels better edge edge clarity god rays downsides heavier 470g cv1 without cable vs 660g quest 3 elite style headstrap perfect blacks controller tracking might worse depending many sensors used cv1 additional 190g feel like closer face cable tugging headset controller tracking plain better cv1 go pro controllers blacks yeah anything oh man yeah updated cv1 cv2

jacks headset support window ended wanted something like dollar200 instead ton horror stories support software supposed make possible see android phone notifications within vr would really useful except never even kinda worked software instead tended make steamvr unusable vive pretty good headset fact came controllers straight away huge plus cv1 originally released without controllers came xbox controller box along oculus insisting rift seated experience bizarre time lighthouse tracking also unbeatable years yeah care another good htc headset upgraded one hand expensive hand headset still pretty limited deckard ever comes upgrade though lot current vr systems would upgrade original vive big enough justify cost would love something innovative base stations controls great screen bonus points valve product set lighthouses anymore inside come long way expected eight years early tracking systems rsiked nausea looking psvr1 think mostly thing past point put lighthouses office often filled various projects easily clear vr use would probably actually use headset rely base stations enough upgrade thing definitely big part though gpu market awful many years help thing either finally upgraded 970 last year used 3070 dollar280 edit dollar200 dollar280 confident 970 could drive higher resolutions framerates upgraded headset lot never went index point would kind consider quest 3 get distaste meta thus interest deckard hate everyone equally energy likes bigscreen beyond tho like every headset mentioned tbh even crystal dude slander meme deep meant fun well sweetspot fact really fast find use ajust view settings helps lot know put headset properly dialed ipd according eyes using since lauch find like less 10 sec even though white texts still little bit blurry cinematic mode sweet spot concern graining meshing texture due low resolution besides still recommend ps5 bsb master race even making joke really joke quest pro user damn got master race mid hope yall get better someday lmao pimax crystal yep pretty accurate experience crystal pretty much 30percent chance decides want connect pc chance disconnect mid game actually close game process reason online sim racing leagues crystal slander rift haha quest3 users spot feel game whole battery capacity cardboard users idk man big screen beyond great visuals heard even tho super small one uncomfortable headsets due sits ur eyebrow cheek bone lots reports digging giving pain thing makes index better inside tracking cause many deaths controllers losing tracking coughs beyond mid lol many drawbacks lens amp display glarin sun fr fr pimax crystal garbage almalance made better still mid support ship two different cables flash firmware using adb get software remotely close working lighthouse faceplate start drifting away sunset bsb still pretty crap fov sweet spot even exceptionally stunning visuals fact bsb managed use pancake lenses source insanely bright oleds get around loss light pancake lenses still ended less perfect clarity situation noticeable sweet spot huge misstep put headset comparible res quest 2 3 oled panels perfect headset instead made headset match tiny brains full rez 90hz thing stopping quest 2 user still happy headset see reason upgrade least quest 4 probably yeah fun let dust settle next generation possibly one got quest 2 used wait til 3 pro whatever reaches price want pay happy quest 2 sure 3 avp better whatever got quest 2 new still delivers want 3d gaming stand alone pc would recommend splurging quest 3 2 2 still need fun yeah used lot recently appreciable reason upgrade lens clarity every improvement feels incremental lenses generational improvement imo passthrough nice like perk feature handful worthwhile games use color passthrough really improve game make gimmick stuff like eleven table tennis actually use amazingly allowing sure lunge piece furniture something going tricky shot thrill fight since throwing full force punches xr elite

overall despite drawbacks box least comfortable headset ever used noticeable mura though less psvr1 like brightness psvr2 controllers probably favorite best vr controllers ever used like index knuckles controllers running vive pro 1080 need 4090 thought special encoding feature vd exclusive 4090 might whole 4000 series vive wireless software runs fine old hardware probably different encoding quest sure referring av1 codec locked behind 4090 4080 use decodable quest 3 though maybe thinking thing requires 4090 godlike quality setting highest level resolution 3 1k per eye ultra 2 7k per eye diminishing returns real happen 4090 push resolution aaa games might well use godlike beat saber user latency sucks even wifi 6e right next headset computer would play beat saber way care synthriders play rhythm games wired streaming stand wireless even get link cable compared raw displayport v2 antennae whaaaaa im happy quest 3 forgot visor nailed bsb win quest 2 meme actually works everyone spent good time using vr realize little actually good content really bad memes woeful also forgot avp users xd index one spot though still see people trying push even though outdated price

nerves kind tech least 10 years away near future rather subjective measure absolutely right said optimistically within next ten years well two see happening pretty soon though arguments limits wireless bandwidth well someone tried something twenty years ago sucked always suck especially comes technology nothing ever gets better makes feel better developers try use haptics right vive make

perfectly fair trade nobody assuming photorealism first generations need wireless vr rendered regular computer low latency e high bandwidth channel overly fancy compression schemes wifi much another gear vr intel use phone comes years late point gear vr surpasses transmitting video infrared 60ghz radio something kind think see anything like 60ghz wifi potential quite fast nearly fast enough heavy compression still necessary especially consider future headsets higher resolution think decent compromise met going cable connected headset doubt however means could change agree putting hardware headset silly see reason could put hardware inside another portable device though couple ghz bandwidth 60ghz would enough rudimentary compression 2 megapixels entirely uncompressed 90 frames per second 24 bits per pixel 4 3 gigabits bandwidth brought several times simple compression schemes add latency really ip data wifi wrong approach needs like old time tv transmitted entirely uncompressed signal modern advances like simple compression methods used gpu textures 1080p headset sure unfortunately headsets developed technology like 60ghz radio technology becomes commonplace likely much higher resolution current estimates 60ghz transmissions put 7gbit going push 4k signal 90hz possible clever compression techniques worry compression artifacts bad noticeable always get better

digging vufine wearable display smart glasses might budget budget issue think epson moverio would fit bill recall seeing mention people trying though maybe couple years back definitely want try many intriguing possibilities ignore people saying weird crazy people always prudes stuff years certain least half trying probably special apps far form factor could good candidate low profile much closer pair glasses though still uses external wired power bank would probably jury rig elastic clamp depending vigorous activity levels would probably start base going attempt serious fashion five hundred bucks pop though good much else beyond light content use possible fully standalone version next couple years though since google cancelled daydream unfortunately sure well phone based vr works daydream run newer devices may hunt side load apks used stream plex pc daydream time worked great know tricky would set nowadays super inexpensive option would seriously consider oculus go nice light inexpensive stand alone units unfortunately made ideal simple vr media viewers ok resolution still used streaming video pc less dollar100 ebay sometimes lot less need make meta account though use probably simplest cheapest solution right lightweight device pointed relatively inexpensive video glasses devices depends whether want viewing traditional 2d content vs vr video think vr content obviously much appealing use case sound like want watch tv device specifically made vr give options vive flow probably want light wireless bluetooth connection phone play movies videos theater like feel streaming sites work iirc george constanza real advice get nreal air likely unsupported sooner rather later bytedance stopped making consumer headsets many bugs terms pcvr aware likely using immersed time time one thing notice games got configuration pico controllers show quest controllers instead sometimes miss function controller case open menu zero caliber button mapping working half life alyx showed valve controllers showed use touchpad time download custom controller calibration steam workaround already started unsupporting live streams gone past two months entirely true still os streaming assistant updates way beta launched couple weeks ago also got new game releases last month arizons sunshine 2 think focusing vision pro knockoff rather going quest route official word want use pcvr perfectly fine standalone would highly recommend quest 3 bytedance laid half pico staff recently sure pico headsets would invest pico game store money could wasted even pcvr gaming quest 3 imo better choice tight money pico 4 liked much pcvr upgraded quest 3 sold pico 4 like quest 3 better pico 4 definitely step quest 2 due better lenses higher res facial interface atrocious though bought new amvr one actually fit light bleed sides like stock one also like fixed headstrap many people complain quest headsets need 3rd party headstraps made comfortable actually see big advantage many choose really find right one fit pico 4 strap ok perfect also annoying come headphones alone bad use right yeah somehow thought would good idea include 3 5mm headphone jack easily connect headphones instead buy usb c 3 5mm adapter ideally also additional charging port took lot time find one actually works supports 18w charging power cost additional 20 eur adapter always dangling usb port optimal hated pico cheaped 3 5mm port also thought displays bright enough 100percent bit darker would acceptable also worth note image calibration little warmer tends go reds compared quest headsets controllers fine especially compared bulky quest 2 ones however like ringless quest 3 controllers even yes primarily pcvr experience quest 2 past week borrowed mate mine pico 4 third price quest 3 pretty big regard really want use pcvr go friend owns quest 2 also use pcvr underestimate social aspects want play friend together online play pcvr standalone every game supports cross platform play better platform yes pico 4 nice wireless pcvr headset 1 3 price compared quest 3 better choice please make sure use wirelessly wireless vr gaming best already capable router consider buying dedicated wifi6 router nah pcvr also use headset much except friends hence ok borrowing amp x200b making sure use wirelessly would limitation wifi connection maybe would use often friend could play play walkabout minigolf elven assassin regularly friends online quest 2 3 headsets super easy communicate via quest group call jump games running standalone quests fun anyway cross play limitations stem game matter cable connection wireless want play online friends accept many games cross platform compatible go pico 4 capable fine pcvr headset fortunately liked coop multiplayer games good crossplay support mentioned walkabout minigolf also play regularly friends mix quest 2 3 psvr 2 pcvr works flawlessly appreciated gt pico 4 third price quest 3 pretty big regard really interesting see different people talking vr prices wherever live pico 4 price quest 2 4 5s price 128gb quest 3 even slightly less half price 512gb quest 3 owned one since launch biggest issu comfort

untill reach quest 3 price pico 4 better bionocular overlap quest 3 picture quality pcvr almost ultra using virtual desktop headset umstable wifi connection many thanks yeah q3 almost 3 times price pico honestly accessories bad heard edge clarity better q3 pico though mean ipd adjustment say binocular overlap picture overlap better pico edge edge little bit better quest 3 see different swap quest 3 pico 4 like wow use pico 4 cause quest 3 little bit better edge edge clarity big issues biggest gripes standalone headset controller tracking fails outside range headset cameras much prefered full room volume tracking old pcvr setup wall moutned cameras throw things perfectly naturally standalone headset example far fewer standalone app meta also fewer sidequest apps often lenses made slight imperfections causes slight visible wavyness move head sideways obvious horizontal elements image left lens perfect right lens slightly noticeable menu though using pcvr matter worst thing global pico 4 way global non game resources limited compared available chinese users includes frequent engagement user community livestreams larger selection videos films public viewing rooms douyin interactivity etc headset perfect always minor things wish different said big issue would say default facial interface pretty awful amvr geekvr interfaces good though semi big issue pico store significan notly less quest store strictly pcvr matter good standalone games quite come pico price though incredible headset would say worst aspects standalone software support lens glare internal reflections screens bit washed terms colour contrast compared competition 3 5mm headphone output pico pc streaming software worst seen super comfy excellent sharpness though obviously streaming side taken care solutions like virtual desktop q3 directly compare would totally happy pcvr worst aspect wifi fry brain even joking using every day almost hour started loosing sense touch 2 fingers left hand targeted headaches loss balance know came headset stopped using everything came back normal would use headset sure wifi really put turning alone help yeah tried fact tried many times want use headset anymore may sound bit nuts swear conspiracy theorist haha would buy another headset wifi even electronics screens starts sound safer hope helps apart support issues good value comfortable box bit dim compared quest colors bit washed due cheap lcd panels comfort may depend bought lineage asian market version much less space nose murder least comfortable headset ever worn far compression comfort bitrate much lower quest artifacts obvious facial interface pretty much torture device recently got one want spend twice much quest 3 mainly pcvr would say thing bugs glare reflections lenses often makes things look like lenses fogged though happened ever vr headset owned sure avoid everything else blast reflection light leaked outside env new vr sure things work yet say looking bright screen black background brightness screen make bloom effect black background around screen making things look foggy smeary happen time big contrast screen would think especially vr thanks gt wireless streaming hands tracking believe pico invent anything add quest features way quicker copy things pico wireless streaming oculus pico made wireless vr headsets oculus anything copying going way pico first well would worse pico streaming assistant developed years got super basic app worse virtual desktop quest 2 never even use virtual desktop default airlink works well xiaomi wifi6 router max

1000 dollar one issue index high end compare quest 2 q2 low end difference marginal price would buy index instead q2 price difference worth index seems overpriced q2 underpriced fair point think facebook going pretty cleverly way console manufacturers used sell hardware cost get people ecosystem worked extremely well userbase much bigger hear games getting downgraded able support standalone quest hardware hope pcvr quest manage get userbase big enough neither needs suffer hear showed q2 couple friends heard price got shocked first thing go buy one black week hits stock may gone think oculus huge vr community even high end gamers means downgrading games moment getting everyone vr make everything grow much people drawn towards higher end equipment time much like starting shitty console today high end pc starting q2 know seek higher end vrs time planting seed make grow would probably never get high end vr cheap q2 think lot people boat believe make high end section vr industry explode possible though think quite obvious consequence compare pc console high end pcs see similar thing happening goes average people seeing friend gaming system e g ps4 mid range pc

serving humanity since biblical times microsoft never really compete late many family members 70 loving quest 2 computer literate find using quest easy never use pc vr thanks valve making steamvr open platform unlike facbook meta oculus closed setup elaborate open steamvr allows headset run valve puts development effort making various headset platforms compatible steamsvr apis comparison oculus bunch exclusive games played store quest even restricted even making games available rift users oculus store relatively trivial cared important remember lot headsets used pc even used steam lot users play exclusively via oculus pcvr platform far steam ecosystem yeah pretty crazy gt lot users play exclusively via oculus pcvr platform calling bullshit pcvr would limit self oculus store willing bet less 1percent oculus pcvr users buy oculus store consider fairly large number occlus users gaming pc anything pcvr mobilevr anyone paying attention knows holidays mobilevr 4 5 times big pcvr love many people still use rift like oculus barely support anymore complete joke sometimes miss og rift feels like lot things gone backwards since still use mine resolution obviously good point still think one best headsets overall even years later yeah rift still best headset ever used user glasses affordable yet comfortable decent resolution panel quest 2 software also shit worry feeling left focusing people play standalone stg none cables work properly probably want buy official one cries cv1 honestly though great headset seeing fidelity headsets leaves lot desired great ergonomics black levels controllers though rift cable finally died decided get quest 2 benefits rift simply put headset vr oculus app running quest link air link fast thing quest 2 link cable choose use tethered pc like rift unlike rift free ditch cable go wireless use native text games apps rift comfortable quest 2 comfortable quest 1 gt rift cable finally died decided get quest 2 benefits rift simply put headset vr oculus app running quest link air link fast went rift g2 headset always plop head whenever may need recalibrate position sometimes takes two seconds worry quest 2 users like year like quest 1 owners left aint gonna accept psvr 2 platform look 20 years advanced graphics game complexity quest users use steam survey accurate full vr universe numbers would even lopsided counted everyone uses vr pc standalone ps quest would still top dog much larger margin point making yeah agree op given oculus arguably consumer priced headset surprised wonder vive pure trash need find buyer cosmos quick headset would bad support anything oculus anything better costing less 35 percent quest 2 doubt bad choice user hacks fakebook becomes annoying like either affordable headset prefer kidneys staying sli two work better one also interesting see lot people still use vive 1 cosmos new world considering resolution theoretically better index new headsets supersede cheapest choice thus popular wireless alone pro point overall also everything better ever owned htc product know mean htc even offers upgrade options cosmos wireless shitty extremly expensive literally charge 200 euros faceplate piece plastic expect get basestations new controllers cosmos ones work base stations oculus delivers box decent resolution wireless topping also powerful smartphone processor included package makes headset work standalone quest 2 also ability hook pc usb c cable hybrid nature pcvr stand alone low price made buy one dollar300 annoying problems pcvr side things love headset quest 2 fuller package ways let ignore shortcuts taken headset comfort build quality along accessories breaking guess needs upgrades rather get cheap headset upgrade getting expensive one still need upgrade gt shortcuts taken headset comfort build quality benefit drawback barrier entry needs low possible industry actually benefits also upgrade money spend wmr headsets used cheapest starting dollar99 never gained 12percent market share steam garbage service compared quest wired investment marketing made vr gaming experience comparable everything else going real competition could look differently hope joining pcvr first time soon excited lesgo 5percent cv1 gang really sad also rather inaccurate steam survey recognize pimax instance saying falls saying refused acknowledge existence 5k 8k x headsets either way would suspect pimax significan notly altering stats fuck facebook though meta tbh gonna keep calling facebook spite hide history name untill stuff related facebook brand still facebook honestly price lack needing sensor boxes imagine hardly use actual desktop oculus ever two games actual headset forgot wireless huge benefit using quest yep anyone comes wireless desktop like use better screen even dollar100 good bought samsung odyssey 2020 still absolutely reason switch different headset however enjoy friends bring oculus quest 2 enjoy vr experience together ngl valve index makes lot expected especially since vive around long get index country htc ludicrously expensive wonder oculus ahead also fact use quest 2 pcvr usb c cable stand alone mode low dollar300 knew would ahead heard price tag gt also fact use quest 2 pcvr usb c cable need cable half way decent router well shit quest 2 300 usd pretty good next competitor costs 3 4 times much remotely 3 4 times better talk buddies spending 300 usd join vr 1000 god damn hard sale let tell keep saying valve needed make cheap inside versions index means make deckard make affordable headset otherwise kind thing happens friends except one took one look facebook balked idea looked prices alternatives balked still understand oculus dropped support second largest headset pc quest 2 everything rift simplifies support structure instead trying figure solutions two headsets operate differently focus one oculus quest 2 months market outsold lenovo rift predecessors combined cos companies retarded fuck giving facecrap free monopoly cry afterwards catch anymore fuck companies care anymore late true story hell psvr like best seller several months oculus became popular psvr users like 2percent steamvr users know high considering support steamvr chart vr market chart ohhh bad people play steam psvr headsets damn reverb g2 ai even board wonder big part make actual technical reason get oculus headsets though especially comes controllers tracking fidelity seems models pander casual uses pale comparison precise input output gear inside tracking controllers better wmr cosmos touch controllers ergonomic fov narrower pretty much everything else wide margin aside pimax wireless pcvr standalones pretty good also like sharpness wide sweetspot reasons aside cost care ux failing rift quite bit cons inexplicable push great audio solution requirement facebook account etc things really good target lower budget fooled price others margins make profit hardware margins quest hardware near 0 comparing dollar dollar value entirely accurate metric personally quite oculus hmds played around index vive also reverb g2 find gravitating towards q2 even pcvr g2 gets relegated mostly space flight racing sims index bright artefacts bit distracting brain mainly ignored sharpness hard dial would sharp across fov fov noticeably bigger nothing major brain tends ignore narrower fov really like eye relief adjustment audio index audio reverb liked rift cv1 audio solution well biggest disappointment comes index resolution controllers probably got overhyped waiting love strap ton inputs even entirely functional within games immersion multipliers never comfortable touch melts hand especially cv1 played wired cv1 headset cable never really bothered much yes tangled rested back etc play quest readily trade visual fidelity wireless pcvr wireless pcvr without specialised hardware pretty good primarily value dollar nothing comes close quest comes get price oculus insight tracking every bit accurate htc vive tracking keep hands fov cameras couple seconds time people matter depending want vr could make quest thing head set camera tracked controllers go said technical financial reasons like getting value

behind head good fidelity important immersion even playing games hands view time wmr samsung odyssey still going strong wish devs would break compatibility tho yep turns cost availability winners yet even bringing sub vaguely positive light makes people react like told someone get plague yeah truly sad momentary state vr want feel really sad realize oculus quest users connect pc even vr ready pc exactly went quest idk bought quest 2 use airlink steamvr yea would curious see many stick evil guy ecosystem afford high end pc afford update road get point like whole invasive exclusive development

reposting pie chart super cool charts coming soon hate affordable oculus devices fb ones leading market wish never sold matter time ruin whole ametaverse bullshit predict fail metaverse terrifying believe people willing defend facebook really says lot consumers bring product market people desire afford bam suddenly bad anymore well course easily cost effective options sad say people afford spend double double sake morals morals us fucked soon still using rift still using rift cv1 yes going monopoly regardless still best hmd market feel ashamed downgrading perfectly capable extension zuck mind quest mostly pcvr quest really dislike lot quest community comes lot people using quests children lot toxic go multiplayer vr game pcvr really get toxicity classic sell product loss market share scheme going wtf general mills headset best expect meta disables steamvr compatibility index become widely used vr headset steam would quest originally support fb added support later would say

super cheap titles en masse till market becomes flooded entirely unusable needs like steam steam monopoly comes non vr want monopoly standalone vr thank goodness oculus pc competed equally steam best thing consumers competition would 2 stores dominate enough competition many hard switch steam trying monopoly really bad job oculus hand focusing trying create monopoly anti consumer tactics worse

interesting idea wether serious meta got head strap halloween costume attire likely meme know prototyping looks like someone extracted dna quest sharted sent new dna molecular printer single run bonelab proud reddit immersive glue heating lacks snorkel love light blocking around clear lenses mean actually want make vr headset probably consider getting 3d printer make durable plastic shell headset since think cardboard would really cut anycubic kobra good printer start dollar259 quite cheap 3d printer real likely still prototyping phases usually physicallity comes prototyping finished design set cardboard cheap quick reusable works well prototyping design way works nice screen 2005 one still mine samsung 710t turn vertical well made administrative computers still use today lol fun ima real wouldnt use know oculus hmd looked like conception serious creation likely infancy getting see truly form think serious thing artist r electroboom meta adventure pro quest pro minimalist

places even low res might useful literally anywhere need basic text instruction looking elsewhere hands occupied musicians cooking come mind lord knows pain phone locks food hands also need see next ingredient dawns cooking goggles google already try something called glass believe special name people wearing well try glass per say single non stereo 3d display tried stuff whole smartphone basically added bunch features one asked cameras pretty invasive charged ungodly amount money half assed killed google products go similar clearly several reasons gt added bunch features one asked kind point trying figure people would actually use gt cameras pretty invasive device meant streaming continuous recording 30 minutes continuous camera operation would kill battery overheat first lot easier secretly record someone pretending mess around phone staring directly weird thing face get hidden camera pen stick shirt pocket dollar30 amazon record much longer gt half assed killed google products go talking ass released two hardware revisions since killed buy new one right next day shipping found niche enterprise customers bother marketing consumers understand apply meta r amp department needs duct tape cool think could grab shots inside pov style pancake lenses wow looks really cool must hard respect beavis butthead something similar holy shit wanted could make design open source like lucas vr gloves way people make headset gloves sort stuff run raspberry pi pc headset cube demo think making code making fully compatible pc would love hear inside know people fun impressed love high tech cardboard padding nice computer system powering would say raspberry pi arduino would good system like would love see used grabbed one arduinos two lied screens prototype looks like proper proto looks badass honestly work steamvr software standalone sick impressive boot oh yes thought days experimental hmds gone get dude discord youtube channel go see progress updates ummm would like know works run blade sorcery mods may suggest invest 3d printer man looks amazing far keep actually kinda surprised slim managed make missing build headphones side like ones slide onto ear tracking woah fffing impressive hopefully get talent level someday keep making awesomeness cheers sick could post photo two looks first person even blank displays reflecting screen would pretty cool like r tomorrow vr awesome work keep going want start ar create headset project please help resources start whats latency like virtual desktop pcvr might get one good everyone hating coolest thing seen day thinking thing idea start planning using cardboard though cool would love hear details butters looks like bd wreath bro need 3d printer new pico open source let beat meta really great amount effort kudos hope os dev prototypes go well industry really needs underdog competitors current state basically leaves position buy big box go broke run bonelab tho work man got get 3d printer great tool stuff like prob still better graphics quest famous eye suicide eyes bleeding good work could really use 3d printer vr home impressive work well spinning cube working fully working os good luck op wires excessively long small ones great news people wishing thing point making prototypes work yes demo mode interesting hate guy idk actually works displays properly reflect eye glasses would need reflective lattice redirect light 135 degrees otherwise displays reflect 90 degrees would direct top headset eyes course reflective lattice easy etch pair plastic glasses see photo assume op enlighten directs reflection displays pair blinkers ears thing actually working spinning cube screens perfect reflect top headset need position accurately giving edgerunner vibes shows class busts system even nice work could probably make project north star optical combiner work proper elliptical profile optical coatings think still get smart prototypingdotcom dollar40 neat use rpi use quest 3 virtual desktop need oculus software also use steam link allows quest connect straight steamvr without oculus software oh really thats game changer thought possible thank pico chinese government ofc know
